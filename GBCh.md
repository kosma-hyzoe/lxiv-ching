HEXAGRAM NUMBER ONE --
THE DYNAMIC

Other titles: The Creative, The Symbol of Heaven, The Creative Principle,
Force, The Key, Creativity, The Originating, Creative Power, Primal Power, Yang,
The Life Force, Kundalini, God the Father

Judgment

Legge: The Dynamic represents what is great and originating, penetrating,
advantageous, correct and firm.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Creative works sublime success, furthering through
perseverance.

Blofeld: The Creative Principle. Sublime Success! Persistence in a righteous
course brings reward.

Liu: The Creative brings great success, benefiting all through perseverance.

Ritsema/Karcher: Force: Spring Growing Harvesting Trial. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of the primal spirit power that both creates
and destroys. It emphasizes that dynamic, unwearied persisting, the action of
Force, is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are
told to: persist!]

Shaughnessy: The Key: Primary reception; beneficial to determine.

Cleary(1): Heaven creates, develops, brings about fruition and
consummation.

Cleary(1): The creative is successful; this is beneficial if correct.

Wu: The Originator is primordial, pervasive, prosperous and persevering.

The Image

Legge: Heaven, in its motion, gives the idea of strength. The superior man, in
accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The movement of heaven is full of power. Thus the superior
man makes himself strong and untiring.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes the power of the celestial forces in motion,
wherewith the Superior Man labors unceasingly to strengthen his own character.

Liu: Heaven moves powerfully; the superior man strengthens himself
unceasingly.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven moves persistingly. A Chun tzu uses originating
strength not to pause.

Cleary(1): The activity of heaven is powerful; superior people thereby
strengthen themselves ceaselessly.

Wu: Heaven moves in full strength. Thus the jun zi strives ceaselessly to be self-
reliant.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: All things owe their inception to the vast and originating
power of The Dynamic. It contains all the meaning of the word: Heaven.
Clouds move, rain falls, and the myriad things appear in their created forms. The
sages comprehend the link between the end and the beginning. They understand
how the changes of the six lines of the hexagram are accomplished, each in its
season, and with this knowledge they ascend toward Heaven as though mounted
on six dragons. The intent of The Dynamic is to transform everything so that it
reflects its correct nature as originally conceived by the mind of Heaven.
Thereafter, this great harmony is preserved in union and firm correctness. The
sage appears aloft, high above all things, and the myriad states are harmoniously
united.

Legge: For the Chinese, the dragon has been from the earliest times a symbol of
dignity, wisdom, sovereignty and sagehood. It is the symbol of the superior man,
and especially the "great man," exhibiting all the virtues and attributes of
Heaven. Although the dragon's home is in the water, it can disport itself on land,
and also fly through the air.

The sage rules in the world of men as Heaven rules nature. He sees the
connection between the end and the beginning as the law of cause and effect in
the operations of nature and human affairs. The various steps in that course are
symbolized by the lines of the hexagram, and the ideal sage, conducting his ideal
government, is represented as driving through the sky in a carriage drawn by six
dragons.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The Dynamic is the life force itself.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

The Superior Man tirelessly furthers the Great Work of Transformation.

The image of a dragon appears in every line of this hexagram, except the
third. Like most symbols, the dragon has both a positive and a negative aspect.
In Western myth, it is usually an adversary which the hero must conquer before
he can obtain a treasure or often, a captive maiden. The Chinese, on the other
hand, regard the dragon positively. Blofeld comments:

In China, the dragon has always been regarded as a highly admirable
creature of celestial origin. Dragons provide rain; make rivers run and
rule the ocean. The European dragon is clearly of another species.

This seeming anomaly may say more about how east and west perceive the
forces of nature, rather than refer to any true differences in the forces perceived.

Wilhelm compares the dragon to the electrical energy within a
thunderstorm -- as lightning it can destroy us, but in the form of electricity it can
be harnessed to do useful work. A dragon is nothing if not a huge serpent, and
this suggests the idea of the "serpent power," or Kundalini energy which when
aroused in the human body has been likened to a sudden jolt of electricity
running up from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The Kundalini force
is equated in turn with sexual energy -- dynamic power which ensures the
continuance of all but the most primitive of living organisms. Without the
powerful energy of sexuality, life as we know it could not exist.

When the dragon remains unconquered in the cave-like depths of the
unconscious, the life force autonomously rules our lives and we become passive
vehicles for random desires and appetites. This "electricity" will flow wherever it
finds a circuit of least resistance, and under these conditions an individual's life is
largely "created" by chance and circumstance. When one begins the Work, the
task of Individuation, one assumes the role of the hero or warrior, who does
battle with the dragon in order to bring it under his will. This is a great struggle,
and success is not guaranteed, but if one is able to control the primordial power
of the life force, the treasure (or the maiden, which in the male psyche amounts
to the same thing), is obtained. This is tantamount to attaining a higher level of
consciousness -- in its highest form it constitutes "enlightenment."

The symbolism of all of the hexagrams works on many different levels, and
this is especially true of the first two, which must be studied together for a full
comprehension of each. (Kabbalists, for example, will recognize in these two
figures the same forces found in Chokmah and Binah on the Tree of Life.) For the
purposes of this comparison it must be noted that the first hexagram symbolizes
Heaven, and the second symbolizes Earth: Force and Form. (As consciousness is
to the body it inhabits, so Force is to Form and Heaven to Earth.) Form is
magnetic, or "negative" in polarity, and Force is dynamic, or "positive."
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

In esoteric symbolism "Heaven" does not mean the universe above us -- it
means the consciousness within us. This polarity is also reflected in the
relationship between the ego and the Self -- in a properly regulated psyche, the
ego is always magnetic to the dynamic Self.

There is an invisible universe within the visible one, a world of causes
within the world of effects. There is force within matter, and the two are
one, and are dependent for their existence on a third, which is the
mysterious cause of their existence. There is a world of soul within a
world of matter, and the two are one, and caused by the world of spirit.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

To get a fuller grasp of the numinously beautiful structure of the I Ching
and the transcendent reality which it reflects, one should meditate on each of the
hexagrams as often as possible -- one can never exhaust their meaning. The first
two hexagrams (because they are the "cosmic parents" of all the others), are
especially rich in their associations. Here are a few suggestions for meditation:

    Compare and contrast the general ideas in the first three hexagrams,
    noting how the third is a logical progression of the first two.
    The Confucian commentary on The Dynamic is particularly rich in
    meaning. Read it over and over again -- it contains the principles of the Work as
    outlined in more detail in the other hexagrams. Compare the sixth sentence with
    the ideas in hexagram number twenty, Contemplation.
    Compare the first two hexagrams with hexagram number eleven,
    Harmony, and number twelve, Divorcement, noting the implications of the
    symbolism in terms of the proper management of the Work.

Line-1

Legge: In the first line, dynamic, we see its subject as the dragon lying hid in the
deep. It is not the time for active doing.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hidden dragon. Do not act.

Blofeld: The concealed dragon refrains from action.

Liu: The hibernating dragon does not act.

Ritsema/Karcher: Immersed dragon, no availing-of.

Shaughnessy: Submersed dragon; do not use.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

Cleary(1): Hidden dragon: Do not use it.

Cleary(2): The hidden dragon is not to be employed.

Wu: The dragon lying submerged is not to be used.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This appears from the dynamic and undivided line being in
the lowest place. Wilhelm/Baynes: For the light-giving force is still below.
Blofeld: The life- sustaining force is still submerged. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Yang located below indeed. Wu: Because the yang is in the lowest position.

The Master said: "There he is, with the powers of the dragon, and yet lying
hid. The world cannot influence him, for he does not pander to its approval. He
lives withdrawn from the world without regret, and its disapproval doesn’t
bother him. He rejoices in this opportunity to further his work, but if
circumstances do not favor this he can as easily retire. He cannot be separated
from the source of his being. This is the dragon lying hid."

Miscellaneous notes: The position is too low. The dynamic power is stored up
and hidden. This is the originating power which is the source of life and growth.
The actions of the superior man demonstrate his virtue every day, but when
concealment is required he restrains the full expression of his work and takes no
action.

Legge: The dragon can be the symbol of the superior man, or the great man --
the sage on the throne.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is unknown, like a dragon lying hidden. The occasion
is not yet ripe for his appearance. He is not moved by public opinion and the
desire for fame. He bides his time in self-confidence and silence.

Wing: The time is not ripe for action. You have all the Creative Power that
you need to achieve your aim, but you must wait for the opportune moment. If
necessary, you may direct activities from behind the scenes.

Editor: The image suggests the dragon in its cave. The forces of the unconscious
psyche are hidden from conscious awareness and constitute a potential threat.
To take action under such circumstances would at the very least be to risk an
unpleasant or unmanageable confrontation with a superior force. Since this is
the bottom line of the hexagram, the image reminds us of the serpent power, or
Kundalini, lying coiled and asleep at the base of the spine. Those who have
experienced the premature and uncontrolled release of this force have attested to
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

its extremely negative qualities -- both physical pain and acute psychological
stress are commonly described. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram
becomes number forty-four, Temptation, the corresponding line of which reads
in part: "...If she moves in any direction, evil will appear." This reinforces the
idea of taking no action whatsoever under the prevailing conditions, despite your
possible temptation to do so.

The unconscious is not a demoniacal monster, but a natural entity which,
as far as moral sense, aesthetic taste, and intellectual judgment go, is
completely neutral. It only becomes dangerous when our conscious
attitude to it is hopelessly wrong. To the degree that we repress it, its
danger increases.
Jung -- The Practice of Psychotherapy

A. There are concealed forces in the situation. Take no action when you
are unaware of the hidden consequences.

B. Energy is gathering in the unconscious psyche. Leave it alone -- it will
express itself when the time is ripe.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows the dragon appearing in the field. It
will be advantageous to meet with the great man.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the
great man.

Blofeld: The dragon is perceived in an open place; it is advantageous to visit a
great man.

Liu: The dragon is seen on the field. There is benefit in meeting a great man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Visualizing dragon located-in the fields. Harvesting:
visualizing great people.

Shaughnessy: Appearing dragon in the fields; beneficial to see the great man.

Cleary(1): Seeing the dragon in the field: It is beneficial to see a great person.

Wu: There appears the dragon in the field. It will be advantageous to see the
great man.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The diffusion of virtuous influence has been wide.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Already the influence of character reaches far. Blofeld: The
great man's deeds are everywhere distributed. Ritsema/Karcher: Actualizing-
tao spreading-out throughout indeed. [Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the
course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE:
acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.] Wu:
Because his virtue is being widely recognized.

The Master said: "There he is, with the qualities of the dragon, and occupying
exactly the central place. His everyday speech and conduct is natural and
without affectation. He is on guard against depravity, and thereby preserves
his inner virtue. The world recognizes his power because he does not call
attention to it. Such expressions of integrity are the qualities of a ruler, and
transform the world."

Miscellaneous notes: The time still requires him to be unemployed. All under
Heaven begins to be adorned and brightened. The correct accumulation of power
creates beneficial results. The superior man consolidates his perceptions and
evaluates their implications with bemused detachment, as befits a virtuous ruler.

Legge: We have the superior man developing, by means of the processes
described, into the great man, with the attributes of a ruler, the appearance of
whom is a blessing to men.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A transformation ensues. The man appears among his peers, although not
yet in a position of authority. His virtues are displayed, and his goodness
becomes known. The prognosis is good for his impact upon the world. It is
propitious to see him.

Wing: Take note of a person who is active in the field of your interest. Although
he may not be in a position of Creative Power, his conduct is above reproach
and therefore he has significant influence. It would be to your advantage to align
yourself with him.

Editor: A field is a wide and open place where movement is relatively
unrestricted. The dynamic force here has room to move in any direction. To
ensure that this energy moves in the proper direction, we are counseled to
maintain a firm connection with "the great man" -- the best that is in us, our
highest intuition or inner voice: the Self. The imagery of the line therefore
suggests the expansion of awareness, or of coming into one's power. It does not
necessarily counsel action.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

We should watch the activity of the Self within ourselves and try to make
it an influence in our actual life. If for instance I have a dream that I
should do something (since our hypothesis is that the dream is so to speak
a letter from the Self), that would be an activity from the archetype of the
Self, and to give that to the dragon to eat would mean that I make it valid
for the body of my actual physical life, i.e., my decision, whether I do this
or that, from morning to evening.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. You are beginning to get the idea -- stay connected to avoid going
astray.

B. Power accumulates -- stay in touch with your highest potential to
ensure that this energy stays focused on the Work.
Line-3

Legge: In the third line, dynamic, we see its subject as the superior man
active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful and
apprehensive. The position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: All day long the superior man is creatively active. At
nightfall his mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No blame.

Blofeld: The superior man busies himself the whole day through and evening
finds him thoroughly alert. Trouble threatens, but he is not at fault.

Liu: The superior man works creatively the whole day, and is cautious in the
evening. Danger. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: A Chun tzu completing the day: Force, Force. Nightfall,
awe, like adversity. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The gentleman throughout the day is so initiating; at night he is
ashen as if in danger; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): A superior person works diligently all day, is careful at night.
Danger, but no error.

Wu: The jun zi should follow the way of The Dynamic all day long. He should
keep himself alert in the day as well as in the evening. If so, he will be free from
error, despite alarming situations.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This refers to the treading of the proper path over and over
again. Wilhelm/Baynes: One goes to and fro on the right path. Blofeld: He
goes over his work again and again. Ritsema/Karcher: Reversing returning
tao indeed. Wu: Take into consideration the principle of cyclic reversion.

The Master said: "The superior man evolves through faithful devotion to his
work; and he ensures its endurance by the awareness and control of his speech.
His comprehension of fundamental principles enables him to attain his goals,
but once attained, he does not exceed their proper limit. Exalted without pride,
abased without fear, vigilant in his actions and attentive to the requirements of
the time, he copes with danger without error."

Miscellaneous notes: Now he does his proper business. He acts according
to the requirements of the time. He is doubly strong, but beyond the center --
neither in Heaven above, or the field below. Vigilance and concern in a perilous
position insure against error.

Legge: The dynamic line is in its proper place. In the exercise of his caution he
will refrain from any improper action.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man's fame begins to spread. Such periods of transition are always
unsettling. There is tension in the air. But the man retains his integrity and
avoids being swept along by the masses, which flock to him. He remains active,
vigilant, careful, and apprehensive. The prevention of mistakes under perilous
circumstances is ever on his mind.

Wing: A new world of Creative Power is opening to you. Others will become
aware of this and attach themselves to you in hopes that they may use your gain
in influence for their own aims. There is danger in this, for your energies may
become distracted before they are stabilized. If you hold fiercely to your vision
and integrity you will be protected.

Editor: This line marks the threshold between the lower and upper trigrams,
and suggests a place of transition -- a kind of no-man's land where forces advance
and retreat as conditions require. The superior man is the warrior in the service
of the Work, and although he is consciously aware of his task (he is vigilant
during the day), he must remain alert to unconscious (night, or evening) factors
which might usurp his judgment. This is alluded to in the Confucian commentary
in terms of the awareness and control of speech. The control of language is
extremely difficult, for it is by means of spontaneous remarks that unconscious
forces often manage to express themselves despite all of our intentions to the
contrary. It is for this reason that a common discipline of inner work is the strict
control of expression -- for example, the vow not to use the word "I" in
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

conversation. (Aleister Crowley is said to have demanded that his disciples slash
their arms with a razor every time they broke this rule!) Ritsema/Karcher render
"adversity," (LI) as: "Danger, threatening, malevolent demon ... It indicates a
spirit or ghost that seeks revenge by inflicting suffering upon the living.
Pacifying or exorcizing such a spirit can have a healing effect." If this is the only
changing line, the new hexagram created is number ten, Cautious Advance,
which repeats the image of careful vigilance as well as the idea in the Confucian
commentary of "Treading the proper path over and over again." Compare with
line 3 of Hexagram 10.

The psyche is a self-regulating system that maintains its equilibrium just
as the body does. Every process that goes too far immediately and
inevitably calls forth compensations, and without these there would be
neither a normal metabolism nor a normal psyche. In this sense we can
take the theory of compensation as a basic law of psychic behavior. Too
little on one side results in too much on the other.
Jung -- The Practice of Psychotherapy

A. Although you are consciously devoted to the Work, you must watch out
for unconscious elements in your psyche which would hinder your progress.

B. Monitor your words and deeds.

C. Be very careful now in what you do.
Line-4

Legge: In the fourth dynamic line we see its subject as the dragon looking as if
he were leaping up, but still in the deep. There will be no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wavering flight over the depths. No blame.

Blofeld: Leaping about on the brink of a chasm, he is not at fault.

Liu: The dragon leaps from the abyss. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Maybe capering located-in the abyss. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: And now jumping in the depths; there is no trouble.

Cleary(1): Sometimes leaping, or in the abyss: no error.

Cleary(2): One may leap in the abyss. No error.

Wu: The dragon may leap out of the abyss. There will be no blame.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep. If he
advances there will be no error. Wilhelm/Baynes: Advance is not a mistake.
Blofeld: For him to advance would involve no fault. Ritsema/Karcher:
Advancing without fault indeed. Wu: It is blameless to proceed.

The Master said: "Without a permanent home either above or below, the
superior man yet commits no error. He advances or retreats as circumstances
require and conforms to the law of his nature. The superior man, devoted to his
work and the evolution of his virtue, advances only at the proper time, and
therefore avoids mistakes."

Miscellaneous notes: He tests himself. A change is in process. The power is
not central: neither in Heaven above, nor in the field beneath, nor in the human
realm between them. Because he is perplexed and anxious about his choices he
will incur no blame.

Legge: Both the third and fourth lines of any hexagram belong to man, and are
intermediate between those of Heaven above and those of Earth beneath. K'ung
Ying-ta, to explain the difficulty in what is said on this fourth line, says that man
is actually nearer to Earth than to Heaven, and is aptly represented therefore by
the third line and not by the fourth. In any event, the subject of this fourth line
will move very cautiously, and so escape blame.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: After a while the man is confronted with a choice for public service in world
affairs or solitude in further personal development. Either is appropriate if
pursued in virtue and at the proper time.

Wing: A time of choice is at hand. Because of amplification in your Creative
Power you must decide whether to enter the public eye and serve society, or
whether to withdraw and work on your inner development. Follow your deepest
intuition and you will not make a mistake.

Editor: The fourth line bears a certain similarity to the third: as the lowest line
of the upper trigram, it is also in a threshold position of transition. Although
hesitation and uncertainty are implied, one is counseled to take action when it is
appropriate to do so. This implies that you are on the right track, but that certain
self-confidence is required. The line can sometimes just portray a confused
situation.

Every advance in culture is, psychologically, an extension of
consciousness, a coming to consciousness that can take place only
through discrimination. Therefore an advance always begins with
individuation, that is to say with the individual, conscious of his isolation,

1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

cutting a new path through hitherto untrodden territory. To do this he
must first return to the fundamental facts of his own being, irrespective
of all authority and tradition, and allow himself to become conscious of
his distinctiveness.
Jung -- The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche

A. Keep trying.

B. The will is being tested through a transitional period. The power for
advancement depends upon the self- confidence that comes with knowing you
have made a correct choice.

C. To stay on top of a changing situation, keep the faith and play it by ear.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth dynamic line shows its subject as the dragon on the wing in the
sky. It will be advantageous to meet with the great man.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great
man.

Blofeld: The dragon wings across the sky; it is advantageous to visit a great
man.

Liu: The dragon flies in the heavens. There is benefit in meeting a great man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Flying dragon located-in heaven. Harvesting: visualizing
Great People.

Shaughnessy: Flying dragon in the heavens; beneficial to see the great man.

Cleary(1): The flying dragon is in the sky: it is beneficial to see a great person.

Cleary(2): ... Beneficial to see great people.

Wu: The flying dragon is in the sky. It will be advantageous to see the great man.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The great man rouses himself to his work. Wilhelm/
Baynes: This shows the great man at work. Blofeld: This passage presages the
emergence of a being who is truly great. Ritsema/Karcher: Great People
creating indeed. Wu: This signifies success of the great man.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

The Master said: "Notes of the same key vibrate in harmony, birds of a
feather flock together. Water descends and fire ascends. Clouds follow the
dragon, and the winds follow the tiger. When the sage appears, all men look up
to him. Heavenly things ascend, earthly things descend -- so does everything
follow its kind."

Miscellaneous notes: The subject of the line commands from above. This
shows that his position is based upon heavenly virtue. The attributes of the great
man are in harmony with Heaven and Earth: his intelligence is like the sun and
moon; his procedures are like the four seasons, and his equilibrium
resonates with the powers of the inner worlds. If he precedes Heaven, Heaven
will not oppose him; if he follows Heaven, he will follow its laws. If Heaven does
not oppose, how much less will men or spiritual forces!

Legge: The fifth is almost always the place of honor and authority in the
hexagram, and here the great man is seen as the sage on the throne. The
argument is that as things of the same kind respond to and seek one another, so
is it with the sage and ordinary men. They are of the same kind, though far apart;
and when a sage appears, all other men look to him with admiration and hope.
Ch'eng-tzu says here that "Heaven and Earth are another name for Tao, and
that because the sage is in harmony with the Tao or practical reason of the
universe, how could men or spirits be contrary to him?"

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: In due time, the man makes his appearance and sets about his work, like
the dragon on wing in the heavens. His beneficent influence spreads over the
world.

Wing: Whatever you choose to do is in accord with the cosmos. Your thinking is
clearheaded. Because of this your influence is great and your milieu will look to
you for inspiration.

Editor: Whatever the specific meaning of this line may be in regard to the
situation at hand, it is a very powerful omen. If this is the only changing line, the
new hexagram created is number fourteen, Wealth. The alchemists regarded
the winged dragon as the "volatile element," which is exactly what is pictured
here. Wings enable entities to travel in the element of air: the mental realm of
thought. The image suggests the life force breaking free into a higher plane --
this could refer to anything from the invention of a better mousetrap to the
attainment of an enlightened state of awareness. One is cautioned however, not
to get carried away with this sudden release of power -- it is always advantageous
to meet with the "great man" -- that is, stay connected to the best that is in you
lest you ascend to the condition imaged in line six. That the great man "rouses
himself to his work" suggests that an open and decorous handling of one's power
is in accordance with the intent of the Self from which it emanates.
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

The hero's main feat is to overcome the monster of darkness: it is the long
hoped-for and expected triumph of consciousness over the unconscious.
The coming of consciousness was probably the most tremendous
experience of primeval times, for with it a world came into being whose
existence no one expected before. "And God said, Let there be light'" is the
projection of that immemorial experience of the separation of
consciousness from the unconscious.
Jung -- The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious

A. Incredible energy is being released within the psyche. Maintain your
connection with your best intuition.

B. You are in harmony with your Tao.

C. You have all the power you need to achieve your goal.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth dynamic line shows its subject as a dragon exceeding the
proper limits. There will be occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.

Blofeld: A willful dragon has cause for regret.

Liu: The dragon is arrogant and will have cause to repent.

Ritsema/Karcher: Overbearing dragon possesses repenting.

Shaughnessy: Resisting dragon; there is regret.

Cleary(1): A proud dragon has regrets.

Cleary(2): At the peak, the dragon has regret.

Wu: The arrogant dragon will have regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A state of fullness cannot be made to last forever.
Wilhelm/Baynes: What is full cannot last. Blofeld: This signifies that not for
long will his cup be full. Ritsema/Karcher: Overfilling, not permitting lasting
indeed. Wu: A state of fullness may not be had for long.

The master said: "Although noble, he is not in his proper place; although
exalted, there are none to acknowledge him. There are men of virtue and ability
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

below, but he does nothing to assist them. Hence whatever he does will lead to
regret."

Miscellaneous notes: When the mean is exceeded, calamity ensues. It is too
late now -- the time of opportunity has passed. He only knows how to advance,
but not how to retreat; he knows life, but not death; how to gain, but not how to
lose. He can dish it out, but he can't take it --only the sage understands such
things, but he is not a sage.

Legge: The dragon appears in the sixth line as going beyond the proper limits.
The ruling-sage has gone through all the spheres in which he is called on to
display his attributes, and now it is time for him to relax. The line should not
always be pulled tight, the bow should not always be kept drawn. The continuous
use of force will give occasion for repentance. In short, the exalted shall be
abased.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: There is always danger in circumstances of abundance. The inferior man
pushes forward through excessive ambition, thereby losing touch with men of
talent and virtue in positions below him. The ruling sage knows when to display
his qualities and to relax, to maintain and to let go, to win and not to lose.

Wing: Your ambitions far exceed the possibilities of your Creative Power. If
you pursue this dream you will lose touch with reality and lose contact with your
community. You will no longer know how to behave appropriately and will
ultimately regret your actions.

Editor: The high-flying dragon of the fifth line has gone too far and the energy
which began in the unconscious depths of line number one has now become
unbalanced power which is doomed to exhaustion and failure. We are reminded
of the saying: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." If this is
the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number forty-three,
Breakthrough -- in this instance suggesting break-down into a condition of
chaos. The corresponding line of that hexagram says: "Shows its subject without
any helpers on whom to call. Her end will be evil." The injunction to maintain
connected with the Self has been ignored, and one is left to suffer the
consequences. Note however that there is an implicit qualifier in this line: it
states what happens when one is arrogant: it doesn’t necessarily state that the
querent is arrogant. Often the line seems to be more of a reminder about cause
and effect than a fait accompli. Wilhelm/Baynes show this best: “[An] Arrogant
dragon will have cause to repent.”

Just as a negative inflation brings life to a standstill, so a positive
inflation, causing the ego to feel itself powerful, dominant, and "always
right," is likewise against life. For a person whose ego suffers from such
an invasion of nonpersonal powers does not contact life directly either.

1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

Instead of facing life and its tasks realistically on the level of his actual
attainments, he approaches them with the assumption that he is master.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Arrogant illusions of power will destroy you.

B. Without guidance from the Self, the ego creates chaos.

SPECIAL NOTE:

Editor: If all of the lines of The Dynamic are changing, an extremely
momentous situation is indicated. This and hexagram number two, The
Magnetic, are the only figures in which such a configuration is commented
upon; hence, these are arguably the two strongest images the oracle has to offer.

Legge: If the host of dragons thus appearing were to divest themselves of their
heads, there would be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There appears a flight of dragons without heads. Good
fortune.

Blofeld: A brood of headless dragons appears; good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Visualizing flocking dragons without a head.
Significant.

Shaughnessy: See the flock of dragons without heads; auspicious.

Cleary(1): Having dragons appear without heads is good.

Cleary(2): Using yang, you see a group of headless dragons; this is auspicious.

Wu: There appears a group of dragons without a leader. Auspicious. [If the
transformation of all the six yang (dragons) takes place together as a group
without any one yang trying to lead the others, hence “without a leader,” the
transformed hexagram will be The Magnetic, the pure yin hexagram. And
this will be great ... In terms of human affairs, the message here simply is: Do
your work the best you can, but don’t think you are very much better than
everyone else. When you are ready to lead, your purpose should be serving your
fellow men, but not self-serving.]

Further Commentaries (from Wilhelm)

"When The Creative, the great, undergoes change in all the [lines], the
world is set in order."
1 -- The Dynamic -- 1

"When The Creative, the great, undergoes change in all the [lines], one
perceives the law of heaven."

Editor: Wu’s interpretation of “head” as “leader” makes more sense than any of
the other translations.

Personal Note: The very first time I ever consulted the I Ching I received The
Dynamic with all changing lines. At the time I didn't understand it, and it
meant nothing to me; in retrospect I see that it was a portent which has changed
my entire life.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWO --
THE MAGNETIC

Other titles: The Receptive, The Symbol of Earth, Submission, The Passive
Principle, Field, The Flow, Responsive Service, Yin, Natural Response, The
Bearer

Judgment

Legge: The Magnetic means success through the docility of a mare. If the
superior man takes the initiative, he goes astray, but if he follows, he finds his
proper lord. It is advantageous to find one's friends in the southwest, and
to lose them in the northeast. Through a passively firm correctness, there will be
good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Receptive brings about sublime success, furthering
through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior man undertakes something
and tries to lead, he goes astray; but if he follows, he finds guidance. It is
favorable to find friends in the west and south, to forgo friends in the east and
north. Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: The Passive Principle. Sublime success! Its omen is a mare,
symbolizing advantage. The Superior Man has an objective and sets forth to gain
it. At first he goes astray, but later finds his bearings. It is advantageous to gain
friends in the west and the south, but friends in the east and the north will be lost
to us. Peaceful and righteous persistence brings good fortune.

Liu: The Receptive: great success. Benefiting from the quality of a mare --
perseverance. The superior man has an undertaking; in the beginning he will go
astray, but later will receive guidance. He can find a friend in the southwest and
lose friends in the northeast. Peacefulness and continuance. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Field: Spring Growing Harvesting, female horse's Trial.
A chun tzu possesses directed going. Beforehand delusion, afterwards
acquiring. A lord Harvesting. Western South: acquiring partnering. Eastern
North: losing partnering. Quiet Trial significant. [This hexagram describes
your situation in terms of the primal structuring power confronted with many
forces and obstacles. It emphasizes that giving way in order to serve and yield
results, the action of Field, is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with
the time, you are told to yield!]
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

Shaughnessy: The Flow: Prime receipt; beneficial for the determination of a
mare; the gentleman has someplace to go, is first lost but later gains his ruler;
beneficial to the southwest to gain a friend, to the northeast to lose a friend;
contented determination is auspicious.

Cleary(1): With earth, creativity and development are achieved in the
faithfulness of the female horse. The superior person has somewhere to go.
Taking the lead, one goes astray; following, one finds the master. It is beneficial
to gain companionship in the southwest and lose companionship in the
northeast. Stability in rectitude is good.

Cleary(2): The creative is successful. It is beneficial to be correct like a mare.
People with developmental potential have a goal; if they go ahead before this,
they will get lost. If they follow, they get the benefit of the director.
Companionship is found in the southwest; companionship is lost in the
northeast. Stability and correctness bode well.

Wu: The Bearer is primordial, pervasive, prosperous, and has the perseverance
of a mare. When the jun zi is going to undertake a task, he will lose his direction if
he leads, and he will find guidance if he follows. This will be advantageous. If he
goes south or west, he will win friends; if he goes north or east, he will lose them.
If he can be content and single-hearted, he will have good fortune.

The Image

Legge: The capacity and sustaining power of the Earth is shown in The
Magnetic. The superior man supports men and things with his large virtue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The earth's condition is receptive devotion. Thus the
superior man who has breadth of character carries the outer world.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes the passivity of the terrestrial forces.
The Superior Man displays the highest virtue by embracing all things.

Liu: The earth's condition is that of the Receptive. The superior man has the
greatness of character to bear with everything in the world.

Ritsema/Karcher: Earth potency: Field. A chun tzu uses munificent
actualizing-tao to carry the beings. [Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the
course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire,
TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary(1): The configuration of earth is receptive; superior people support
others with warmth.

Cleary(2): The attitude of earth is receptivity. Thus do leaders support people
with rich virtue.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

Wu: The Bearer symbolizes the physical features and resources of the earth.
Thus the jun zi uses his immense virtue to bear his responsibilities.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: All things owe their birth to the great originating capacity of
The Magnetic -- it obediently receives the influences of Heaven. Its largeness
contains and supports all things, and its capacity matches the unlimited power of
The Dynamic. Its comprehension is wide, its brilliance great, and through it all
things are fully developed. The mare is a creature of the earth, with a limitless
power to traverse the land. She is mild and docile, with stamina and capacity for
work. Such is the path of the superior man. If he takes the initiative, he loses his
way; if he follows, he finds it again. In the southwest he will walk with his own
kind. To lose friends in the northeast means he is well rid of them. The passively
firm correctness of the superior man imitates the unlimited capacity of the earth.

Legge: The same attributes are ascribed to The Magnetic as in the former
hexagram to The Dynamic -- but with a difference: The Dynamic originates,
The Magnetic produces, or gives birth to what has been originated. This figure,
made of six divided lines, symbolizes the idea of subordination and docility. The
superior man described here must not take the initiative, and by following he will
find his lord – the subject of The Dynamic. The firm correctness is analogous
to a mare -- docile and strong, but a creature for the service of man. That it is not
the sex of the animal which is paramount is plain from the mention of the
superior man and his lord.

The superior man will bring his friends with him to serve the ruler. The
southwest is the direction proper for The Magnetic. The northeast is the
direction proper for the trigram of the Mountain -- hence a direction of
obstruction and impasse, the opposite of magnetic receptivity. Thus the
injunction to seek friends who are receptive, and shun those who are recalcitrant.

Concerning The Image, Lin Hsi-yuan says: "The superior man, in his
single person sustains the burden of all under the sky. The common people
depend on him for their rest and enjoyment. Birds and beasts and creeping
things, and the tribes of the vegetable kingdom, depend on him for the
fulfillment of their destined being. If he be of a narrow mind and cold virtue,
how can he help them? Their hope in him would be in vain."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The ego bears the burden of the Work. Success is found in
compliance with the will of the Self.

The Superior Man supports the Work through its many transformations.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

In terms of the symbolism of the Work, the second hexagram clearly
shows the proper role of the ego as one of receptivity to the will of the Self. The
sexual, male-female metaphor must be interpreted as one of polarity. The ego,
inhabiting a physical body, is the psychological link which connects the material
dimension of spacetime with the world of thought where the Self resides. To be
receptive to the influence of the Self is to allow its energy to work through the
ego-body to attain its purpose. This earth-like receptivity is seen as a feminine
quality, as the Heavenly dynamic force emanating from the Self is seen as
masculine. Earth means the body in spacetime, and Heaven means the realm of
thought transcending spacetime -- the Pleroma of the gnostics which Jung
referred to as the Collective Unconscious. The concept is also found in the
Kabbalah:

I am the Door of Life,
The passage from the world of ideas
Into the world of form...
Now, as Daleth [the Door],
I present myself as the Portal
Through which life, Eternal and Unbounded,
Entereth the realm of temporal and limited creation...
I am the fruitful womb
Whence all creatures have their birth.
P.F. Case -- The Book of Tokens

The message in the Judgment clearly indicates the ego's proper role –
"If the superior man takes the initiative, he goes astray." This is supplemented
by the image of a docile mare which uncomplainingly bears its load. Indeed,
during certain phases of the Work it becomes painfully obvious that the ego really
is just a beast of burden. The Self is beyond our full comprehension, and at times
it uses us as if we were an expendable tool -- which, to a certain extent, we are.
Only by realizing that our existence in spacetime consists mostly of illusions and
that the Self is the only real thing in our lives, can we come to accept the Work as
the duty we were created to perform.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare the ego-Self relationship in hexagrams one and two with that in
hexagrams seven and eight.
Line-1

Legge: In the first line, magnetic, we see its subject treading on hoar-frost. The
strong ice will come by and by.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When there is hoarfrost underfoot, solid ice is not far off.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

Blofeld: Hoarfrost underfoot betokens the coming of solid ice.

Liu: When hoarfrost is underfoot, solid ice will soon come.

Ritsema/Karcher: Treading frost, hardening ice culminating.

Shaughnessy: Treading on frost: the firm ice will arrive.

Cleary(1): Walking on frost: Hard ice arrives.

Cleary(2): As you walk on frost, hard ice shows up.

Wu: Treading on hoarfrost signals the arrival of solid ice.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The cold air has begun to take form. Allow it to go on
quietly according to its nature, and the hoar- frost will turn to strong ice.
Wilhelm/Baynes: When the dark power begins to grow rigid and continues in
this way, things reach the point of solid ice. Blofeld: This line indicates the
approach of winter's dark power; following nature's sequence, the season of solid
ice is at hand. Ritsema/Karcher: Yin begins solidifying indeed. Docilely
involving one's tao: culminating hardening the ice indeed. Cleary(2): The first
congealing of yin. Mastering that path is coming to hard ice. Wu: Vapor from the
yin has begun to coalesce. As it takes its normal course, solid ice will come soon.

Miscellaneous notes: The family that accumulates goodness is sure to have
superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have
superabundant misery. The murder of a ruler by his minister, or of his father by
a son, is not the result of events of one morning or one evening. The causes of it
have gradually accumulated through the absence of early discrimination. Hence,
"She treads on the hoar-frost; the strong ice will come by and by," shows the
natural issue and growth of things.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is careful not to overlook the first signs of evil and
decay. The threatening dangers are checked before their natural issue and
growth.

Wing: If you look carefully, you can see the very beginnings of decay entering the
situation. Total deterioration is not far off. Make preparations now for the
coming change.

Editor: Water relates to the emotions and to the unconscious. Water
becoming ice suggests frigid emotions or unconscious energy which is frozen and
unusable. To tread is to advance, and to tread on hoar-frost is to advance toward
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

an ever more unyielding situation. If our attitudes are thus leading us into an
impasse, it only makes sense to "return to virtue," one of the names of the
hexagram which is created if this is the only changing line.

This is the condition of avidya, not-knowing, which Buddha described as
the supreme obstacle in the way of enlightenment. For primal sloth, the
inertia of matter, of the body, can be overcome only when it is
impregnated with the spark of the divine spirit, of consciousness.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. The image suggests the beginning of an impasse.

B. A negative tendency.

C. Stay alert -- dark forces are waxing. (You may be creating the
situation.)
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the attribute of being straight, square,
and great. Its operation, without repeated efforts, will be in every respect
advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Straight, square, great. Without purpose, yet nothing
remains unfurthered.

Blofeld: Straight and of broad capacity, though we do nothing, all our affairs
prosper.

Liu: Straight, square, great -- without study. Everything benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Straightening on-all-sides, great. Not repeating: without
not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Straight, square and great; not repeated; there is nothing not
beneficial.

Cleary(1): Straightforward, correct, great. Unfailing achievement without
practice.

Cleary(2): Upright, straight, great; unfailing benefit without practice.

Wu: True, methodical, and great. There will always be advantages for doing what
comes naturally. [“Doing what comes naturally” as applied to (this line means
doing completely in accordance with the will of heaven.]
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The image shows us the brilliant result of the way of earth.
Wilhelm/Baynes: In the nature of the earth lies the light. Blofeld: This line
indicates a straight- forward movement to occupy a spacious area. Though
nothing is done, everything prospers -- this is a glorious characteristic of the
terrestrial forces. Ritsema/Karcher: Straightening used on-all sides indeed.
Not repeating: without not Harvesting. Earthly tao shining indeed. Cleary(2):
Unfailing benefit without practice; the way of earth is illumined. Wu: True and
methodical. Signify the glory of earth.

Miscellaneous notes: "Straight" indicates the correctness of the internal
principle, and "square," the righteousness of the external act. Thus, the superior
man, through Self- reverence, maintains his inner correctness, and adjusts his
external acts accordingly. This establishment of reverent correctness ensures
that his expressions of virtue are neither partial nor solitary. Such a one has no
doubts about what he does.

Legge: Line two presents to us the earth itself, according to the Chinese
conception of it, as a great cube.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Nature's way is straight and unerring, foursquare and calm, great and
tolerant. Everything is accomplished without the necessity of fabricated purpose.
The man's work is equally self-evident. His internal principles are correct; his
external acts are righteous; his results are certain.

Wing: Drop all artifice about what you are doing. Take your cue from nature:
Become tolerant, straightforward, and self- evident. Strike an inner equilibrium
at this time and success will come easily.

Editor: If the first line describes a condition which is inhospitable for growth,
the second line describes the opposite idea: the receptive Mother Earth herself.
This is the fertile matrix which brings forth life and provides for its nourishment.
The image suggests a huge field with hundreds of freshly ploughed furrows
converging on the horizon. Straight: Direct and open, clear and unambiguous.
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Square: A universal
description of firmness and stability. It suggests the quaternary of the four
directions and symbolizes the earth -- our material existence and the
corresponding Sensation function in the psyche. To be "four- square" is to be
forthright, honest, firmly rooted in the world. Great: Gives the image of the
fertile and boundless earth stretching out in all directions. Implicit in the line is
the idea that no action is required -- the passive earth forces bring forth all things
in time. This suggests the mindlessness of natural processes which obey their
own laws and not the ignorant expectations of men.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

The spirit of the valley never dies.
It is called the Mystic Female.
The door of the Mystic Female
Is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Continuously, continuously,
It seems to remain.
Draw upon it
And it serves you with ease.
Lao Tse

A. Suggests receptivity to experience. Life unfolds -- flow with it.

B. The laws of nature are constant and unchangeable; they are the
permanent matrix within which occurs all change. Allow the situation to develop
at its own pace.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping her excellence under
restraint, but firmly maintaining it. If she should have occasion to engage in the
king's service, though she will not claim the success for herself, she will bring
affairs to a good issue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hidden lines. One is able to remain persevering. If by
chance you are in the service of a king, seek not works, but bring to completion.

Blofeld: Concealment of talent (or beauty) constitutes the right course. As to
the undertaking of public affairs, though immediate success may not be achieved,
their ultimate fruition is assured.

Liu: Hide your ability and you can continue in your position. If in public office,
do not show yourself, but complete the work.

Ritsema/Karcher: Containing composition permitting Trial. Maybe adhering-
to kingly affairs: without accomplishing possessing completion.

Shaughnessy: Enclosing a pattern; it is permissible to determine. Someone
follows the king's service; there is no completion, there is an end.

Cleary(1): Hiding one’s excellence, one can be correct: if one works in
government, there is completion without fabrication.

Cleary(2): Hiding embellishments, affirming rectitude, if one works for the
government, there will be no accomplishment, but there will be a conclusion.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

Wu: Being able to contain splendors is worthy of persevering. If he chooses to
enter into public service, he may be successful in his work, but does not expect
recognition for his success.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Great is the glory of her wisdom -- though she keeps her
excellence under restraint, at the proper time she will manifest it.
Wilhelm/Baynes: One must let them [i.e., her hidden qualities] shine forth at
the right time... The light of wisdom is great. Blofeld: Talent (beauty) now
concealed will be unfolded when the time is ripe; once it is engaged in public
affairs, this talent will become great and glorious. Ritsema/Karcher: Using
the season: shooting-forth indeed. Knowing the shining great indeed. Cleary(2):
Hiding embellishments and affirming rectitude mean timely activation. Working
for the government means that the light of knowledge is great. Wu: Biding one’s
time. Indicates vision.

Miscellaneous notes: Although the subject of this magnetic line has excellent
qualities, she does not display them, but keeps them under restraint. This is the
way of the earth, of a wife, of a minister. The way of the earth is not to claim the
merit of achievement, but on behalf of Heaven to bring things to their proper
issue.

Legge: To keep her excellence under restraint is the part of an officer seeking not
her own glory, but that of the ruler.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man wisely keeps his potentialities hidden so that they can mature
without interference. When serving as an assistant, he remains in the background
and lets glory go to the chief. He manifests himself at the proper time.

Wing: Leave the pursuit of fame to others. Concentrate, instead, upon doing the
best job possible. If you conceal your talents now, you will develop naturally,
without interference. The time will come later for you to reveal yourself and your
good works.

Editor: This line presents the image of a faithful servant, who may not always
understand what is going on, but who has enough faith and discipline to allow the
Work to unfold from within -- to act when bidden, but otherwise to refrain from
interfering with what is a pre-eminently incomprehensible transformation. Thus
does the ego serve the Self.

The Work of Creation for mankind is conscious participation in the
realization of the Divine intention. In this the Kabbalist not only makes
himself more and more aware of the events in the greater and unseen
worlds above but actually helps to bring in the influxes descending from

2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

the upper into the lower worlds. He does this by being skilful in practical
life, psychologically sound and spiritually clear.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah

A. Subdue your ego and let the Self attain its purpose.

B. The image suggests that you may be trying too hard -- stay in the
background and let the Work unfold naturally.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows the symbol of a sack tied up. There will
be no ground for blame or praise.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.

Blofeld: Taciturnity -- no blame, no praise.

Liu: The sack is tied up. No recognition, no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bundled in the bag. Without fault, without praise.

Shaughnessy: Tying the sack; there is no trouble, there is no praise.

Cleary(1): Closing the bag – no blame, no praise.

Wu: Tying up a pouch is without blame or praise.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A sack tied up -- there will be no error. This shows how
through carefulness, no injury will be received. Wilhelm/Baynes: Through
caution one remains free of harm. Blofeld: The passage means that, with proper
caution, we shall escape trouble. [Note: From the point of view of divination, it
is this sentence which best serves as a guide to action.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Consideration not harmful indeed. Cleary(2): Being prudent so as to avoid
harm. Wu: Prudence prevents accidents.

Miscellaneous notes: The interaction between Heaven and Earth creates the
transformation of organic life. When their interaction is restricted, men of virtue
and ability withdraw into obscurity. The line is a lesson of caution.

Legge: Line four shows its subject exercising a still greater restraint than in line
three.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man observes the strictest self-restraint and reserve in dangerous
times. In this way he incurs neither injury from antagonists with designs on pre-
eminence nor obligations to others.

Wing: It is a difficult time, requiring caution. Develop an inner reserve and
maintain a low profile. This can be done within the mainstream of society or in
the strictest of solitude. Confrontations now will lead to antagonism or
undesirable obligations.

Editor: A tied-up sack is a very womb-like image -- who can tell what is going on
inside of it? Gestation is a slow and hidden process, and we cannot know the
outcome until its time is complete. The line often depicts a stalemate. At such
times it is best to take no action at all.

The creative process has a feminine quality, and the creative work arises
from unconscious depths -- we might truly say from the realm of the
Mothers. Whenever the creative force predominates, life is ruled and
shaped by the unconscious rather than by the conscious will.
Jung -- The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature

A. The situation is inconclusive. Wait it out.

B. An answer is not forthcoming at this time.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the yellow lower garment. There will be
great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: A yellow jacket -- sublime good fortune. [Yellow has always been an
exalted color in China, where its use for garments was long restricted to the
Imperial Family. Here it clearly symbolizes virtue.]

Liu: A yellow lower garment means sublime good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: A yellow apron. Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Yellow skirts; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary(1): A yellow garment is very auspicious.

Cleary(2): Yellow lower garment, great good outlook.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

Wu: The yellow lower garment will bring great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This follows from that ornamental color being in the right
and central place. Wilhelm/Baynes: Beauty is within. Blofeld: This passage
refers to inner (spiritual or moral) beauty. Ritsema/Karcher: Pattern located-
in the center indeed. Cleary(2): The culture is in the center. Wu: The elegance
lies within.

Miscellaneous notes: The superior man, arrayed in yellow, possesses
discretion and understanding, and occupies the ruler's place. His virtue comes
from within, and tempers his actions. This is the perfection of excellence.

Legge: Yellow is one of the five correct colors, and the color of the earth. The
lower garment is a symbol of humility. The fifth place is the seat of honor. If its
occupant possesses these qualities, good fortune is indicated.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not display his excellence directly. It is diffused throughout
his conduct of affairs.

Wing: Do not display your potentials and virtues directly but allow them to
permeate all of your affairs. Modesty and discretion about your inner worth yield
the greatest good fortune.

Editor: Among its many symbolic associations, yellow is the color of the sun,
and by extension, of clarity, comprehension and understanding. It is also the
color of gold, as in "the golden mean," which is nothing if not yellow in color. In
dream symbolism, garments often represent attitudes or beliefs with which we
clothe ourselves. None of the translations state in so many words that this
"lower" garment is "underwear," but the symbolism suggests a concealed attitude
or understanding which could be so symbolized. Wilhelm's translation of the
Confucian commentary tells us that the "beauty is within," i.e., concealed. A
"yellow foundation garment" therefore, would be a fundamental attitude which
is balanced and positive in nature.

It is from understanding that power comes; and the power in the
ceremony was in understanding what it meant; for nothing can live well
except in a manner that is suited to the way the sacred Power of the
World lives and moves.
-- Black Elk

A. The image suggests a fundamental understanding or balanced
viewpoint.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

B. "Moderation in all things."
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows dragons fighting in the wild. Their blood
is purple and yellow.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Dragons fight in the meadow. Their blood is black and
yellow. [While the top line of The Creative indicates titanic pride and forms a
parallel to the Greek legend of Icarus, the top line of The Receptive presents a
parallel to the myth of Lucifer's rebellion against God, or to the battle between
the powers of darkness and the gods of Valhalla, which ended with the Twilight
of the Gods.]

Blofeld: Dragons contending in the wilderness shed black and yellow blood.
[That is to say, Yin, the passive dark force, sometimes longs to possess the
qualities of the celestial light force, Yang, and struggles to obtain them.]

Liu: Dragons fight in the wilderness. The blood is black and yellow.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dragons struggling tending-towards the countryside. Their
blood: indigo, yellow.

Shaughnessy: The dragon fights in the wilds: its blood is black and yellow.

Cleary(1): Dragons battle in the field; the blood is dark yellow.

Wu: Dragons are fighting in the wild; their blood is bluish yellow.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The onward course indicated by The Magnetic is pursued
to extremity. Wilhelm/Baynes: The way comes to an end. Blofeld: The
dragons contend, for their stock of merit is exhausted. Ritsema/Karcher:
Their tao exhausted indeed. Cleary(2): The path reaches an impasse. Wu: Their
destiny has come to an end.

Miscellaneous notes: When a magnetic force seeks to usurp a dynamic force,
there is sure to be contention. The mention of dragons is to remind us of the
dynamic power of Heaven. Because neither the dynamic nor magnetic power can
be its opposite, blood is seen. The mixture of colors is the mixture of Heaven and
Earth: Heaven is purple, and Earth is yellow.

Legge: What is said about the sixth line in hexagram number one, The
Dynamic, was that the dragon there exceeded the proper limits. That idea here
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2

takes place in "the wild" as the magnetic line is transformed into a dragon who
fights with the true dragon of the Creative Force. They fight and bleed, and their
respective blood is the color of Heaven and Earth.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is no longer content with his serving role. A bloody contest ensues.
Injury to both parties occurs when serving elements attempt to rule.

Wing: An assertive and ambitious attempt is made to usurp power from an
authority. A violent struggle will follow, resulting in injury to both parties.

Editor: When the magnetic principle tries to lead, when the ego tries to direct
the Work, a devastating conflict erupts in the psyche. If this is the only changing
line, the hexagram becomes number twenty-three, Disintegration. To receive
this line is an extremely negative omen: beware!

For the alchemists, a number of dragons fighting with each other
illustrated the state of putrefactio (separating out the Elements, or
psychic disintegration).
J.E. Cirlot -- Dictionary of Symbols

A. A devastating clash of polarities is imaged.

SPECIAL NOTE:

If all of the lines of The Magnetic are changing, an extremely
momentous situation is indicated. This and hexagram number one, The
Dynamic, are the only figures in which such a configuration is commented
upon; hence, these are arguably the two strongest images the oracle has to offer.

Legge: If those who are thus represented be perpetually correct and firm,
advantage will arise.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When all the lines are [magnetic], it means: Lasting
perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Unfaltering determination will place our affairs on permanent basis.

Ritsema/Karcher: Harvesting: perpetual Trial.

Shaughnessy: Beneficial to determine permanently.

Cleary(1): It is beneficial to always be correct.

Wu: It is advantageous to be ever persevering.
2 -- The Magnetic -- 2
COMMENTARY

I have never received this configuration, so have nothing to add beyond
the observation that perseverance is the only way to further the Work -- "The

DIFFICULTY

Other titles: Difficulty at the Beginning, The Symbol of Bursting, Sprouting,
Hoarding, Distress, Organizational Growth Pains, Difficult Beginnings, Growing
Pains, Initial Obstacles, Initial Hardship

Judgment

Legge: Difficulty indicates progress and success through firm correctness.
Action should not be undertaken lightly, and it is wise to seek help.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Difficulty at the Beginning works supreme success,
furthering through perseverance. Nothing should be undertaken. It furthers one
to appoint helpers.

Blofeld: Difficulty followed by sublime success! Persistence in a righteous
course brings reward; but do not seek some new goal (or destination); it is highly
advantageous to consolidate the present position. [The fundamental idea of this
hexagram is that of birth and growth amidst difficulty, as with a sprouting seed
becoming a young plant and forcing its way through the earth. Our affairs,
being still in their early stages, are vulnerable; we must not wander forth, but
attend to them until they ripen; then, with proper care, the seed will bring forth
a splendid tree. The upper trigram, a pit, suggests a need for caution; but, if we
heed these omens, our success is assured.]

Liu: Difficulty in the Beginning: great success. It is of benefit to continue
without planning to go someplace. One should find helpers.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sprouting. Spring Growing Harvesting Trial. No availing-
of possessing directed going. Harvesting: installing feudatories. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of beginning growth. It emphasizes that
collecting potential in preparation for arduous labor is the adequate way to
handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Hoarding: Prime receipt; beneficial to determine. Do not
herewith have someplace to go; beneficial to establish a lord.

Cleary(1): In difficulty, creativity and development are effective if correct. Do
not use. There is a place to go. It is beneficial to set up a ruler.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

Cleary(2): Creativity is successful. It is beneficial to be correct. Do not make
use of going somewhere. It is beneficial to set up lords.

Wu: Distress is primordial, pervasive, prosperous, and persevering. The subject
should proceed with caution. It will be advantageous to establish marquisates.

The Image

Legge: The image of clouds and thunder forms Difficulty. The superior man,
in accordance with this, adjusts his measures of government as in sorting the
threads of the warp and woof.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Clouds and thunder: the image of Difficulty at the
Beginning. Thus the superior man brings order out of confusion.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes lightning spewed forth by the clouds --
difficulty prevails! The Superior Man busies himself setting things in order.

Liu: Clouds and thunder symbolize Difficulty at the Beginning. The
superior man makes order out of disorder.

Ritsema/Karcher: Clouds, Thunder, Sprouting. A chun tzu uses the canons
to coordinate. [Canons: standards, laws; regular, regulate; the Five Classics.
The ideogram: warp-threads in a loom.]

Cleary(1): Thunder in the clouds is held back; the superior person orders and
arranges.

Cleary(2): Clouds and thunder – Difficulty. Thereby leaders organize.

Wu: Clouds and thunder form hexagram Distress. Thus the jun zi plans and
organizes.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Difficulty is experienced as Heaven and Earth begin their
intercourse, but correct action succeeds in the face of danger. By the action of
thunder and rain, which are the attributes of the lower and upper trigrams, all
between Heaven and Earth is filled up. But the conditions of the time are
irregular and obscure. Authority should be delegated, but the feeling that rest and
peace have been secured should not be indulged in even then.

Legge: The written character for Difficulty is pictorial, and shows a plant
struggling with difficulty as it rises above the surface of the earth. This initial
difficulty is a metaphor for how struggle is the condition of a state which is
emerging from disorder after a revolution. The author saw his social and political
world in great disorder and difficult to reform, yet he had faith in himself and the
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

destiny of his House. Let there be prudence and caution, with unswerving
adherence to the right. Let the government of the different states be entrusted to
good and able men -- then all will be well.

According to the arrangement of the eight trigrams, Heaven and Earth are
the parents of the other six, who are their children. The first-born son is the lower
trigram of Movement, and the second-born son is the upper trigram of Peril.
McClatchie renders here: "The figure of Difficulty represents the hard and the
soft beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering."

The power to move in the lower trigram is likely to produce great effects;
to do this in perilous and difficult circumstances (symbolized by the upper
trigram) requires firmness and correctness. Good princes throughout the realm
will help to remedy the political and social disorder of the times, but the supreme
ruler should not trust his subordinates to the point of relaxing his vigilance.

The lower trigram represents thunder, the upper represents rain clouds.
The hexagram therefore places us in the atmosphere of a thunderstorm -- a
metaphor for the situation of a political state in difficulty. When the thunder has
pealed, and the clouds have discharged their burden of rain, the atmosphere is
cleared and there is a feeling of relief.

Anthony: This hexagram means that we have not yet found the correct path.
It also means confusion: too many possibilities. Nothing is clear. This lack of
clarity is the “hindrance” referred to in the first line of the hexagram. In the
second line, the remedies that come forth are inappropriate. In the first stages of
dealing with a problem, we are tempted to grasp at solutions, whereas we should
wait until the proper actions become clear.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Under the conditions of Difficulty it is best to mark time while
seeking assistance.

The superior man uses careful analysis to separate order from confusion.

Wilhelm’s title for this hexagram is Difficulty at the Beginning. I
prefer Difficulty, because it is a situation encountered at any phase of the
Work, not just the beginning.

Difficulty is experienced because confusion and multiplicity prevail
during the initial phase of any creative activity -- thoughts and feelings proliferate
and threaten to overwhelm the mind with infinite complexity. The only way to
proceed under such circumstances is to carefully sort out the components of the
situation and arrange them in categories and in order of importance. To "sort the
threads of the warp and woof" is to weave a tangled mess into a tapestry.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

The Orderly Sequence of the Hexagrams gives us an image of what takes
place under the hexagram of Difficulty:

When there were Heaven and Earth, then afterwards all things were produced.
What fills up the space between Heaven and Earth are those individual things.
Hence the Dynamic and Magnetic are followed by Difficulty. Difficulty
means filling up.

"Filling up," is rendered as "fullness" in some translations. This is the
exact meaning of the gnostic term: "Pleroma," or "Fullness" which Jung
correlates with the Collective Unconscious or Objective Psyche. These are interior
dimensions from which emanate the archetypal energies which we experience as
instinctual drives and emotional complexes. This is the "hyperspace" from which
the Self, via the oracle, responds to our queries and directs the Work.

Thus we see that the third hexagram, following the creation of the cosmic
pair of opposites in the first two figures, represents a dialectical progression. Lao
Tse, who wrote the Tao Te Ching some six-hundred years after the I Ching
was committed to writing, describes this unfolding process:

Out of Tao, One is born;
Out of One, Two;
Out of Two, Three;
Out of Three, the created universe.
The created universe carries the yin at its back
and the yang in front;
Through the union of their pervading principles
it reaches harmony.

The identical idea is found in many traditions, giving it the status of an
archetype within human consciousness. It is not necessary to be familiar with the
technical terminology of Kabbalah to recognize that the same idea is being
discussed in the following passage:

In Chokmah and Binah we have the archetypal Positive and Negative;
the primordial Maleness and Femaleness, established while
"countenance beheld not countenance" and manifestation was incipient
... It is between these two polarizing aspects of manifestation -- the
Supernal Father and the Supernal Mother -- that the web of life is
woven; souls going back and forth between them like a weaver's shuttle.
In our individual lives, in our physiological rhythms, and in the history
of the rise and fall of nations, we observe the same rhythmic periodicity.
D. Fortune -- The Mystical Qabalah

This idea has been stated very simply:

3 -- Difficulty -- 3

All things are a single form which has divided and multiplied in time and
space.
W.B. Yeats -- A Vision

Is not the sky a father and the earth a mother, and are not all living
things with feet or wings or roots their children?
-- Black Elk

And also with poetic complexity:

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth
was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit
hovered over the water ... God said, "Let the waters teem with living
creatures, and let birds fly above the earth within the vault of heaven."
And so it was ... God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill
the waters of the seas; and let the birds multiply upon the earth.
Genesis

There are some profound ideas in these images about the structure of
human consciousness and the contents of the unconscious psyche. The basic idea
is that of Emanation -- the creation of physical reality from a supreme principle
in ordered hierarchies of increasing complexity. This concept is essential for a full
understanding of the Work.

The involution of man was his descent from the sphere of the spirit,
developing bodies of a mental, emotional and then physical nature until
he manifested upon this planet. His evolution is to civilize this planet and
to develop mastery of the physical, emotional and mental planes and
relink himself in unity with God once more, thus completing the cycle. He
came from God as an inexperienced Spark of Divine Fire and returns to
Him, with all the experience of manifestation, as a Lord of Humanity.
Gareth Knight -- The Work of a Modern Occult Fraternity

In many systems of thought, the proliferation of forces is seen in sexual
terms -- the cosmic parents produce entities in male and female pairs (gnostic
syzygies), which in turn produce offspring. Hence, Confucius says: "Difficulty is
experienced as Heaven and Earth begin their intercourse." That this has an
explicit sexual connotation is confirmed by McClatchie: "The figure of Difficulty
represents the hard and the soft beginning to have sexual intercourse, and
bringing forth with suffering." Thus we see that the correct and incorrect
correlation ("intercourse") of dynamic (male) and magnetic (female) lines in any
I Ching hexagram symbolizes the favorable (life-enhancing) or unfavorable (life-
negating) combinations of thought and feeling within the psyche.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

The sexual intercourse of Heaven and Earth is also described in
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

hexagram number eleven, Harmony. In terms of these sexual metaphors, what
does the term "adultery" imply in regard to the Work? See hexagram number
forty-four, Temptation, for further insight on this theme.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows the difficulty its subject has in advancing.
It will be advantageous for him to abide correct and firm. Advantageous also to be
made a feudal ruler.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hesitation and hindrance. It furthers one to remain
persevering. It furthers one to appoint helpers.

Blofeld: Uncertainty prevails. It is best to make no move, but to build up
determination and to consolidate the position.

Liu: Considering and considering. It is of benefit to continue in the right way.
One should find helpers.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stone pillar. Harvesting: residing in Trial. Harvesting:
installing feudatories.

Shaughnessy: To and fro; beneficial to determine about a dwelling; beneficial
to establish a lord.

Cleary(1): Not going anywhere, it is beneficial to abide in correctness. It is
beneficial to set up a ruler. [It is beneficial to set up the ruler and nurture the
original energy.]

Cleary(2): Staying around, it is beneficial to remain correct. It is beneficial to
set up lords. [In Buddhist terms, to “stay around” means to be immediately
aware of any mental movement and not roll along, following thoughts. This is
what is called “coming back before going far.”]

Wu: There is a formidable obstruction to advance. It will be advantageous,
however, to remain persevering ... etc. [If the subject can remain firm and
correct, he will overcome.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Although there is difficulty in advancing, the mind of the
subject of the line is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles
himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people. Wilhelm/Baynes: The aim
of the work is nonetheless to carry out what is right. When an eminent man
subordinates himself to his inferiors, he wins the hearts of all people. Blofeld:
Despite prevailing uncertainty, the way of righteousness must be pursued with
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

firm correctness. Men in high places, by co-operating with those under their
care, will thereby win the support of the people. Ritsema/Karcher: Although a
stone pillar, purpose moving correctly indeed. Using valuing the mean below. The
great acquiring the commoners indeed. Cleary(2): Though they stay around, the
action of their wills is correct. Because they value the lowly, they win many
people. Wu: Although he is under constraint, he has set his goal correctly. Like a
noble man serving the common people, he will receive their support.

Legge: The first line is energetic and strong, and his place in the trigram of
Movement disposes him to action. But above him is the trigram of Peril, and the
lowest line of that, to whom he must look for response and cooperation, is
magnetic. Hence arise the ideas of difficulty in advancing, the necessity of
caution, and the advantage of being clothed with authority. He is noble, firm and
correct, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and lowly.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man takes stock of the obstacles. He does not force his
advance. He perseveres on the right course and acquires the appropriate
assistants. He continuously rechecks his bearings, as the confusion is gradually
resolved.

Wing: It seems that you have come across a confusing obstacle at the very
beginning of your path. The best way to attract the helpers you will need is to
maintain a devoted and humble attitude. Do not attempt to boldly push ahead
unaided. However, do keep your goal in sight.

Editor: The symbolism suggests the following intrapsychic correlations:
Advance: The advance of consciousness, comprehension, etc. Feudal Ruler: The
ego as master of its thoughts and feelings. "Humbles himself to the mean":
("Mean" here means "lowly.") The ego remains firm and correct, maintains his
will, but doesn't take on airs -- he nurtures his humility. The people: Thoughts,
feelings, opinions, attitudes, emotions, appetites, etc.

The optimal stance that the ego can strive for--without necessarily
hoping that it can ever be accomplished fully -- could be described as a
continual awareness of the conflicting polarities likely to appear in ever-
new forms as old ones are resolved: of waiting and seeing, of living
things out, weighing various aspects and bringing them into balance,
ever ready to work with the materials at hand.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. There are intimidating obstructions to progress. Remain persevering
while seeking assistance. If you subordinate yourself to your situation you’ll gain
insight into its nature. Take no major action.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

B. A difficult path demands impeccable will and full acceptance of
responsibility.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject distressed and obliged to
return. Even the horses of her chariot also seem to be retreating. But not by a
spoiler is she assailed, but by one who seeks her to be his wife. The young lady
maintains her firm correctness, and declines a union. After ten years she will be
united, and have children.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Difficulties pile up. Horse and wagon part. He is not a
robber; he wants to woo when the time comes. The maiden is chaste, she does not
pledge herself. Ten years -- then she pledges herself.

Blofeld: He makes no more progress, covers no more distance,
than a mounted man trotting to and fro. (His hesitation is due) not to an obstacle
but to his wooing a girl who chastely repulses his advances and waits ten years
before giving her consent.

Liu: Many difficulties. He goes back and forth on horseback, but he is not a
robber. He seeks marriage but the girl does not want an engagement. After ten
years she does.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sprouting thus, quitting thus. Riding a horse, arraying thus.
In-no-way outlawry, matrimonial allying. Woman and son, Trial: not nursing.
Ten years- revolved, thereupon nursing.

Shaughnessy: Hoardingly, earth-moundlike, a team of horses vexatious-like; it
is not robbers who confusedly enrich. The [female] child's determination is not to
get pregnant; in ten years then she gets pregnant.

Cleary(1): Difficult to advance, hard to make progress. Mounted on a horse, not
going forward. It is not a matter of enmity, but marriage. The girl is chaste, not
engaged. After ten years she is engaged. [This means not seeking immediate
solutions when in difficulty.]

Cleary(2): Stopped, mounted on a horse but standing still. Not enmity,
marriage... etc.

Wu: There is hesitation to proceed. The horse carriage falters along. A suitor, not
a transgressor, asks for marriage. The young woman chooses to remain chaste
and refuses. After 10 years, however, she consents to the betrothal to another
man.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her difficulty arises from her place over the dynamic line
below her. The union and children after ten years shows things resuming their
regular course. Wilhelm/Baynes: She rests upon a rigid line. Pledging herself
after ten years means return to the general rule. Blofeld: The difficulties are
revealed by this weak line's position just above a firm one. Waiting for ten years
to receive the beloved's consent implies awaiting a gradual return to normal
conditions. Ritsema/Karcher: Six at second's heaviness. Riding a solid indeed.
Ten years-revolved, thereupon nursing. Reversing rules indeed. Cleary(2):
Riding on the obdurate. Getting married after ten years means return to normal.
Wu: Riding on the strong-minded first nine. A return to normalcy.

Legge: Advance is even more difficult for the second line than for line one.
She is magnetic, and pressed by the dynamic line below her. Above, in the fifth
line is the ruler with whom union should be properly sought. All these
circumstances suggest the idea of a young lady sought in marriage by a strong
suitor with whom marriage was unsuitable. She rejects him, and after ten years
marries the only suitable match for her. "Things resume their regular course"
means that she is now at liberty to seek a union with line five.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Progress is further inhibited. Someone suddenly appears who is mistaken
for a robber at first but actually turns out friendly. His offer of help is not to be
accepted. Not being from the right quarter, it may entail undesirable obligations.
Things will resume their regular course at the proper time.

Wing: Confusion and difficulty mount, and decisions become impossible. To
allow yourself to accept help will create a hindering obligation. Therefore it is
best to wait until the situation returns to normal before you continue your
pursuits.

Editor: Horses are a common symbol for energy or libido ("horsepower").
Women and men respectively represent Eros (emotion) and Logos (intellect).
These attributes are consistent throughout the I Ching, and are common in
almost all symbol systems. In this line the man is seen as an unsuitable match for
the woman, psychologically suggesting an improper union of thoughts and
feelings, or the temptation to an emotional rationalization of some sort. The
situation is confused and up in the air: psychic energy is in a state of regression,
and we are tempted to accept the first solution that comes along. Under such
circumstances no progress can be made until things are allowed to settle down.
The "ten years" refer to any fulfilled cycle of time.

I use Eros and Logos merely as conceptual aids to describe the fact that
woman's consciousness is characterized more by the connective quality of
Eros than by the discrimination and cognition associated with Logos. In
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

men, Eros, the function of relationship, is usually less developed than
Logos.
Jung -- Aion

A. Image of an unsettled situation. Resolution of the problem is not
possible now, despite your desire for it. Later on, the situation will resolve itself
naturally.

B. At the moment, emotions are too unsettled to be reconciled with reason.
Reject an unsuitable idea or concept and wait for a better one.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one following the deer without the
guidance of the forester, and only finding himself in the midst of the forest. The
superior man, acquainted with the secret risks, thinks it better to give up
the chase. If he went forward, he would regret it.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Whoever hunts deer without the forester only loses his way
in the forest. The superior man understands the signs of the time and prefers to
desist. To go on brings humiliation.

Blofeld: Pursuing a deer without a guide, the hunter finds himself lost in the
forest. The Superior Man perceives that he must stay where he is, as going
forward would lead to trouble.

Liu: He hunts deer with a forester. He gets lost in the forest. The superior man,
knowing this, prefers to give up the hunt. To go on would bring regret.

Ritsema/Karcher: Approaching stag, lacking precaution. Namely, entering
tending-towards the forest center. A chun tzu almost not thus stowing-away.
Going abashed.

Shaughnessy: Approaching the deer without ornamentation, it is only to enter
into the forest. For the gentleman it is just about as good as dispensing with it; to
go is distressful.

Cleary(1): Chasing deer without a guide, just going into the forest. The superior
person, knowing the dangers, had better give up; to go would bring regret.

Cleary(2): Chasing deer without preparation only goes into the bush. Leaders
see that it is better to give up, for to go would bring regret. [ If you have no
accurate knowledge yourself and do not have enlightened teachers or
associates, and practice blindly, then you will fall into a pit.]
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

Wu: Hunting in the forest without the guidance of a ranger will result in roaming
aimlessly with a chance of getting lost. The jun zi senses the risk. It is better to
quit than to proceed and regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: One pursues the deer without the guidance of the forester in
his eagerness to follow the game. The superior man gives up the chase, knowing
that if he go forward he would be reduced to extremity. Wilhelm/Baynes: He
desires the game, but to go on brings humiliation. It leads to failure. Blofeld:
His lack of caution in hunting the deer resulted from his being too set on
capturing it. The Superior Man always desists when to advance would bring
disaster. Ritsema/Karcher: Approaching stag, without precaution. Using
adhering-to wildfowl indeed. A chun tzu stowing it: Going abashment exhausted
indeed. Cleary(2): Chasing deer without preparation is following the beasts. To
go would bring regret and lead nowhere. Wu: Hunting without a guide is like
chasing around the game. To proceed will end in an awkward situation.

Legge: The third line is magnetic, not central, and in the place of a dynamic line.
These things are all generally unfavorable, but the outcome of the whole
hexagram being good, the superior man sees the immediate danger and avoids it.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man wanders aimlessly without adequate guidance, like a hunter
without a forester. The superior man knows when going forward will cause
regret. He gives up the senseless chase and avoids eventual disgrace.

Wing: You can sense the difficulties that lie ahead on your path. If you
nevertheless plunge into the forest of obstacles without an experienced guide, you
will surely lose your way. Such egotism and vanity brings unrelenting
humiliation. A wiser man will alter his goals here.

Editor: Forest symbolism is usually associated with the feminine principle and
the unconscious psyche. A deer, being a denizen of the forest, could symbolize an
undifferentiated, unassimilated, autonomous force within the situation at hand.
As the object of the quest, it represents the answer to a question, a solution to
your problem, etc. To complete the metaphor, the forester would be your
intuition or inner guide: the Self. The message is that you have no insight into the
prevailing situation and should stop trying to force a solution. Cease your
fruitless speculation and wait for the way to become clear.

It is only when the human being really knows what he is doing that he
can be called self-conscious and responsible. The person who is guided
by his ego alone is not self-conscious in this sense, for he is limited in his
self-knowledge to the conscious realm only, and beyond this terrain
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

yields himself blindly to the obscure urges and devious impulses of the
unconscious.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. “Lost in the woods,” you don't yet grasp your situation. Never act on
what you don’t understand.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject as a lady, the horses of whose
chariot appear in retreat. She seeks, however, the help of him who seeks her to be
his wife. Advance will be fortunate; all will turn out advantageously.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Horse and wagon part. Strive for union. To go brings good
fortune. Everything acts to further.

Blofeld: Hesitating like a man trotting to and fro, he waits for marriage.
Thenceforth, good fortune will prevail and every action prosper. [This passage
indicates that success can certainly be obtained, but only after a considerable
period of waiting patiently.]

Liu: He goes back and forth on horseback. If he seeks marriage, he will have
good fortune. Everything benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Riding a horse, arraying thus. Seeking matrimonial allying.
Going significant. Without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: A team of horses vexatious-like, seeking confused enrichment; to
go is auspicious; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary(1): Mounted on a horse yet not going forward. Seeking marriage, it is
good to go, beneficial all around.

Cleary(2): Mounted on a horse but standing still. Go to seek alliance, and the
good results will benefit all.

Wu: The horse carriage falters along. The lady is being asked for marriage. It will
be auspicious to accept. Everything will be advantageous.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Going forward after such a search for a helper shows
intelligence. Wilhelm/Baynes: To go only when bidden -- this is clarity.
Blofeld: To pursue what we desire, that is wisdom. Ritsema/Karcher:
Seeking and also going. Brightness indeed. Cleary(2): Going in search is
intelligent. Wu: Accepting the proposal shows a clear discernment.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

Legge: The fourth line is the proper correlate of line one, who is the suitor whose
aid she seeks. With his help she is able to cope with the difficulties of her position
and go forward.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man lacks sufficient power to discharge his responsibilities. He is like a
chariot without a horse. But opportunity for help arises. This should be accepted
even in the face of self-abnegation.

Wing: With a little help, perhaps a connection you might exploit, you can attain
your goals. Of course, you must admit that you lack sufficient power to act
independently. If you hesitate over this, you will get nowhere.

Editor: Horses symbolize energy (horsepower) -- here running away from their
female owner, a symbol of the emotional function within the psyche. She seeks
her proper male correlate, a symbol of Logos, the mental function. Their destined
relationship is one of marriage or union. Psychologically interpreted, the image is
of a separation of thought and feeling. The line counsels us to seek a connection,
establish harmony, or bring our emotions under the control of reason.

Direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its
own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.
Kahlil Gibran -- The Prophet

A. You have yet to make a mental connection necessary to understand the
matter at hand -- calm down and figure it out.

B. Unite your thoughts and feelings. Disunion is temporary.

C. Marshall your forces -- "Get your act together."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the difficulties in the way of its subject's
dispensing the rich favors that might be expected from him. With firmness and
correctness there will be good fortune in small things. In great things there will
be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Difficulties in blessing. A little perseverance brings good
fortune. Great perseverance brings misfortune.

Blofeld: Fertility cannot easily be brought about. Persistence in small things
will bring good fortune; in greater matters, it will bring disaster.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

Liu: Difficulties in prosperity. Good fortune for small things. Misfortune for
great things.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sprouting: one's juice. The small, Trial: significant. The
great, Trial: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Hoarding its fat; little determination is auspicious, great
determination is inauspicious.

Cleary(1): Stalling the benefits. Rectitude in small matters is good. Self-
righteousness in great matters brings misfortune. [This is being great but
conscious of the small, waiting for the time to be able to get out of
difficulty.]

Cleary(2): Stalling the benefits. There is good outlook for the correctness of the
small, bad outlook for the correctness of the great.

Wu: Hoarding wealth suggests conditions suitable for limited progress but
detrimental for great undertakings.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He experiences difficulty in bestowing his rich favors -- the
extent to which they reach will not yet be conspicuous. Wilhelm/Baynes:
Because the benefaction is not yet recognized. Blofeld: We have wrought
insufficiently for the public good. Ritsema/Karcher: Sprouting one's juice.
Spreading-out not-yet shining indeed. Cleary(2): The giving is not yet
enlightened. [It is not that there is no giving at all, just that it does not accord
with greater reality.] Wu: His benefaction has not been illuminating. [We
should remind ourselves that distributing accumulations need not be limited to
tangible assets. Kindness, sympathy, and moral support can certainly be
included.]

Legge: Line five is in the place of authority, and should show himself a ruler by
dispensing benefits on a grand scale. But he is in the center of the trigram of
Peril, and his correlate line two is weak. Hence arises the symbolism, and great
things should not be attempted.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attains a position of authority. Premature expressions of good
intentions lead to damaging misinterpretations. Time is required for stepwise
maturation and acquisition of general confidence. Consummation cannot be
forced.

Wing: Although your position is one of authority within the situation, you have
much left to achieve in the way of establishing yourself. Small efforts in this will
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

bring good fortune. But beware: Do not attempt any large endeavor. It could
easily end in disaster.

Editor: The image depicts an impasse or restriction preventing the flow of
energy which would resolve it. Modest effort will improve the situation; major
action will make it worse. Sometimes the line implies that you have not yet
understood the matter under question. It can also image a situation in which
psychic energy is blocked from consciousness.

The attributes of the spirit are not only beyond the power of sensual
perception, but they are beyond the power of intellectual
comprehension; they can only be known to the spirit, and they are called
occult because they cannot be understood without the possession of the
light of the spirit.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

A. Conserve your energy. Take only limited action, one step at a time;
allow the situation to unfold at its own pace.

B. Obstructions inherent in the situation prevent the flow of information
needed to comprehend it. To strive too hard is to lose it altogether.

C. Integral obstacles inhibit an immediate resolution of the situation at
hand.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with the horses of her chariot
obliged to retreat, and weeping tears of blood in streams.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Horse and wagon part. Bloody tears flow.

Blofeld: He hesitates like a man trotting to and fro or like one shedding blood
and tears.

Liu: He goes back and forth on horseback. He sheds tears with blood!
[Arrogance leads to misfortune, perhaps extreme misfortune.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Riding a horse, arraying thus. Weeping blood, coursing
thus.

Shaughnessy: A team of horses vexatious-like, dipping blood streamingly.

Cleary(1): Mounted on a horse, not going forward, weeping tears of blood.

Wu: The horse carriage falters along. Tears roll down from the rider’s eyes.
3 -- Difficulty -- 3
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She weeps tears of blood in streams -- how can the state thus
emblemed continue long? Wilhelm/Baynes: How could one tarry long in this!
Blofeld: How could a flow of blood and tears endure for long? [In other words,
our present troubles will pass away in time.] Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore
permitting long-living indeed? Cleary (2): Weeping tears of blood – what can
last? Wu: Only despair remains.

Legge: The sixth line is magnetic, as is her third line correlate. She is at the
extremity of Peril -- the game is up. What can remain for her in such a case but
terror and abject weeping?

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man fails to overcome the initial difficulties and despair.

Wing: You have lost your perspective. You can no longer see your initial
difficulties realistically, nor can you find your way out. This is disgraceful and will
cause you much regret. It is best to begin again.

Anthony: Desire and fear prevail. The child in us rules. Despairing, we give up
our path. “One should not persist in this.”

Editor: Lines two, four and six all show horses in retreat: strong images of
psychological turmoil and confusion; two and four have proper correlates
however, so they present the possibility of at least some kind of reconciliation.
Here, the correlate is line three, who is depicted as being "lost in the woods.” At
its most neutral, the image is one of severe disunion. Wilhelm and Blofeld state
that the situation is not a lasting one, so all need not be lost if you seek a totally
new and perhaps currently unrecognized connection.

In our ordinary life we are limited and bound in a thousand ways -- the
prey of illusions and phantasms, the slaves of unrecognized complexes,
tossed hither and thither by external influences, blinded and hypnotized
by deceiving appearances. No wonder then that man, in such a state, is
often discontented, insecure and changeable in his moods, thoughts and
actions. Feeling intuitively that he is "one," and yet finding that he is
"divided unto himself," he is bewildered and fails to understand either
himself or others. No wonder that he, not knowing or understanding
himself, has no self- control and is continually involved in his own
mistakes and weaknesses; that so many lives are failures, or are at least
limited and saddened by diseases of mind and body, or tormented by
doubt, discouragement and despair.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis
3 -- Difficulty -- 3

A. Severe disunion prevails, but need not be permanent if you seek a
totally new connection.

B. You have missed the point entirely.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FOUR --
INEXPERIENCE

Other Titles: Youthful Folly, The Symbol of Covering, Immaturity, Uncultivated
Growth, Youth, Acquiring Experience, Youthful Ignorance, Enveloping, Folly,
Darkness "Often the I Ching uses this hexagram to show us that we should not
be asking this question." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Inexperience means progress and success. I do not seek the
inexperienced youth, but he seeks me. When he shows the sincerity proper for
divination, I instruct him. If he asks two or three times, that is troublesome, and I
do not instruct the troublesome. Firm correctness brings advantage.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Youthful Folly has success. It is not I who seek the young
fool; the young fool seeks me. At the first oracle I inform him. If he asks two or
three times, it is importunity. If he importunes, I give him no information.
Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Immaturity. Good fortune! I am not one to seek out uncultivated
youths, but if such a youth seeks me out, I shall at first read and explain the
omens. Yet should he ask me many times, just because of his importunity, I shall
not explain anything more. The omen indicates a need for proper direction. [This
hexagram suggests stubbornness (the upper trigram) issuing from the softness
of the womb (the lower trigram). While it sometimes happens that youthful
rashness succeeds where sober counsels fail, it is nevertheless the duty of the
mature man to cultivate the minds of the young and to respond, within reason,
to their requests for guidance. As an omen, this hexagram may be taken to
imply a case in which a certain amount of rashness may lead to success, but in
which older people are not absolved from the duty of guiding the young. There
is also a suggestion that the Book of Change itself, though fully responsive to
those who make the right approach, will not brook importunity in the form of
trivial questions or of seeking to reverse its judgments by further questioning.
Whether the omen may be taken to mean that we should go ahead with some
rash scheme or that it is time for us to restrain someone's youthful rashness will
depend upon the nature of the enquiry, the people concerned in it and the
particular moving lines involved in the response.]

Liu: It is not I who seek him, the youth seeks me. The first time he asks, I
answer; but if he asks again and again, it is annoyance: no answer. Benefit for
continuance.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Ritsema/Karcher: Enveloping, Growing. In-no-way me seeking youthful
Enveloping. Youthful Enveloping seeking me. The initial oracle-consulting
notifying. Twice, three-times: obscuring. Obscuring, by-consequence not
notifying. Harvesting Trial. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
concealment and clouded awareness. It emphasizes that actively accepting this
concealment in order to nurture growth is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Folly: Receipt; it is not we who seek youthful folly; youthful
folly seeks us. The initial milfoil divination is auspicious, but if two or three times
drawn out, being drawn out then it is not auspicious; beneficial to determine.

Cleary(1): In darkness is development. It is not that I seek naïve innocence;
naïve innocence seeks me. The first augury informs; the second and third defile.
Defilement does not inform. It is beneficial to be correct.

Cleary(2): Darkness. Getting through. It is not that I seek the ignorant; the
ignorant seek me. The first pick informs, the second and third muddle. That
which is muddled does not inform. Benefit is a matter of correctness.

Wu: Ignorance is pervasive. It is not that I ask the ignorant lad to come for
instruction. It is that the ignorant lad comes to request my instruction. As in
divination, he will be instructed the first time. If he asks the same question for
the second and third times, he is disrespectful. Having been judged disrespectful,
he will not be instructed again. It will be advantageous to be persevering.

The Image

Legge: A spring issuing from the mountain -- the image of Inexperience. The
superior man, in accordance with this, nourishes his virtue and strives for
resoluteness of conduct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain: the image of
Youth. Thus the superior man fosters his character by thoroughness in all that
he does.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a watery hole at the foot of a mountain
amidst uncultivated growth. The Superior Man by determined good conduct
nourishes his virtue. [The second sentence is deduced from the first; both are
suggested by the component trigrams.]

Liu: A spring comes out at the foot of the mountain; this symbolizes Youth. The
superior man will cultivate his character through decisive action.

Ritsema/Karcher: below Mountain issuing-forth spring-water. Enveloping.
A chun tzu uses fruiting movement to nurture actualizing-tao. [Actualize-tao:
... Ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos ...
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Under a mountain a spring is produced, in darkness. A superior
person nurtures character with fruitful action.

Cleary (2): Under a mountain emerges a spring, in darkness. Leaders use
effective action to nurture inner qualities.

Wu: A spring flows at the foot of a mountain; this is Ignorance. The jun zi
resolves to taking steps to cultivate his virtue.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Inexperience shows the trigram of the Mountain above
that of the Abyss. The perilous impasse suggested by these figures evokes the idea
of inexperience. Progress and success are suggested because the action and
development of the hexagram conform to the requirements of the time. When
inexperience seeks wisdom, will responds to will. The oracle responds to sincerity
because it has the qualities of the dynamic line in the central second place, but
the oracle does not respond to ignorant importuning. The proper duty of a sage is
to nourish the correct nature of the ignorant.

Legge: Difficulty shows us plants struggling within the earth, and
Inexperience suggests the small and undeveloped sprouts which then appear
upon its surface. This is an image of youthful ignorance, and the object of the
hexagram is to show how those in authority should deal with it. The Judgment
takes the form of the oracle's response to the questioner.

The upper trigram represents a frowning mountain which blocks the
progress of the traveler. The lower trigram symbolizes a stream of water in a
dangerous canyon, such as might be found at the foot of a mountain. The
combination of these symbols suggests the perilous nature of ignorant
inexperience.

The subject of line two represents the oracle, who demands sincerity from
the unenlightened. It is his duty to evoke the innate "correct nature" hidden
within the questioner, to bring this quality out and develop it. In regard to the
Image, Chu Hsi says that "the water of a spring is sure to move on and
gradually advance." This may serve as a symbol of the general process and
progress of education.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Inexperience portrays the relationship between the ego and the
Self as one of student to master. Communication via the oracle demands
seriousness of purpose -- the Self refuses to pander to the ego's illusions.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

The Superior Man furthers the Work by developing his will and intent.

Wilhelm's title for this hexagram is Youthful Folly, which tends to lend
it a negative connotation that is not always strictly applicable. However, he is
quick to point out that the title "should be understood to mean the immaturity of
youth and its consequent lack of wisdom, rather than mere stupidity."

While the title of Inexperience avoids the negative connotation, it must
be acknowledged that there is an aura of irritation in this hexagram which
illustrates an uncomfortable truth about the relationship between the ego and the
Self. The Self is an awesome archetype, and once one has established contact with
him, he assumes a distinctly stern personality. The Self will not pander to the
ego's illusions, and has no patience with anything but the unvarnished truth. Tact
and patience are not among his attributes. Lao Tse describes him very accurately:

The Sage is unkind: He treats the people like sacrificial straw dogs.

Which is just the way it is. As a satellite of the Self, the ego-complex was
not created just so that it could spend a lifetime indulging its fantasies. The Work
must be undertaken, and the Self knows more than you do what remains to be
done. Like any excellent teacher, he demands more of us than we think we have
in us to give. This phenomenon of the tyrannical and often "unjust" Self has been
noted in many times and places. Here is an example from Neo-Platonism:

What shall we say in regard to the question: "Why do the divinities that
are invoked require the worshipper to be just, although they themselves
when entreated consent to perform unjust acts?" In reply to this I am
uncertain in respect to what is meant by "performing unjust acts," as the
same definition may not appear right both to us and to the gods. We, on
the one hand, looking to that which is least significant, consider the
things that are present, the momentary life, what it is and how it
originates. The beings superior to us, let me say, know for certain the
whole life of the soul and all its former lives; and if they bring on a
retribution from the supplication of those who invoke them, they do not
increase it beyond what is just. On the contrary, they aim at the sins
impressed upon the soul in former lifetimes, which men do not perceive,
and so imagine that is unjust that they fall into the misfortunes which
they suffer.
Iamblichus -- The Egyptian Mysteries

A contemporary expression of this idea comes from consciousness
researcher, John Lilly, famous for his work with dolphins and isolation tank
experiments with psychedelic drugs:

Cosmic Love [e.g., the Spiritual Self] is absolutely Ruthless and Highly

4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not.
John Lilly

By definition, "the gods" (archetypes) are not human. Were it possible for
them to evolve without human vessels in Spacetime, presumably we humans
would not exist. It is these archetypes, in the guise of our complexes and limiting
beliefs, that are being altered by the Work. Because the unconscious psyche is a
multiverse, it is sometimes very difficult to differentiate just "who" is advising us,
and the Self via the oracle, will occasionally test us for our ability to use intuitive
common sense.

Which is to say: when the gods (or the "Self") become totally
"unreasonable," we can only go along with them to the limit of our human
understanding. Slavish obedience to all injunctions from the unconscious is to
sell our souls outright to something that we don't understand. The renunciation
of "common sense" is the renunciation of our most precious birthright.

On the other hand, to "disobey" at will is to put our souls at risk. This is
one of the most painful of all dilemmas -- how far do we go in our obedience to
unseen powers? Aspects of this problem have been called The Dark Night of the
Soul -- an inner initiation, a trial by fire to see what we are really made of. There
are times in the advanced course of the Work when one receives the strange
insight that the Self actually wants us to disobey! This ordeal can only be lived
through -- no one can advise you except your own sense of what is right for you at
any given moment.

The most useful guideline that I have found is that the precepts of the
Work (as found in the Perennial Philosophy) are consistent worldwide, and
constitute a reliably moral structure for responsible choice. If the oracle seems to
be telling you to do something contrary to your inner sense of right and wrong,
contrary to your understanding of the precepts of the Work, then go with this
intuition rather than the oracle. The Self, via the oracle, will test you in many
ways to make you develop. (The ultimate goal is to become so infallibly intuitive
that oracles become superfluous.)

The gods need our intelligent disobedience if they themselves are to
evolve. It is in the stress between obedience and conscientious disobedience that
growth takes place. In one sense, whatever choice you make, as long as it is
conscious and you fully accept the consequences, is the right choice for you at
that moment. We learn through our mistakes, and can never fail our lessons if
we truly integrate the experience into our unfolding lives.

Confucius, one of the greatest teachers who ever lived, obviously took his
teaching method from the Judgment of this hexagram:

The Master said: "I won't teach a man who is not anxious to learn, and
will not explain to one who is not trying to make things clear to himself. And if I
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

explain one- fourth and the man doesn't go back and reflect and think out the
implications in the remaining three-fourths for himself, I won't bother to teach
him again."

And so it is with the oracle (the Self) -- the deeper one gets involved in the
Work, the more difficult the lessons become, so that one is always kept in a
position of relative Inexperience. There are times, when a simple answer would
suffice, that you will receive an ambiguous image, which (if you do three-fourths
of the work), will lead you to a profound insight.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, has respect to the dispelling of ignorance. It will
be advantageous to use punishment for that purpose, and to remove the shackles
from the mind. But going on in that way of punishment will give occasion for
regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To make a fool develop it furthers to apply discipline. The
fetters should be removed. To go on in this way brings humiliation.

Blofeld: To enlighten immature youth, it is advisable to apply discipline; even
fetters may be required, but to use them overmuch is harmful.

Liu: To enlighten youth, it is better to use discipline. Obstacles in the mind
should be removed. Otherwise, humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shooting forth Enveloping. Harvesting: availing-of
punishing people. Availing-of stimulating fettering shackles. Using going
abashed.

Shaughnessy: Discarding folly; beneficial to use a punished man, and herewith
to remove shackles and manacles. What has already gone is stressful.

Cleary (1): Opening up darkness, it is advantageous to use punishments. If
restrictions are removed, it will lead to regret.

Cleary (2): To awaken the ignorant, it is beneficial to use punishments; if
restrictions are eased, it will be regrettable to go that way.

Wu: This shows how to instruct the ignorant. It will be advantageous to use
punishment, but let go manacles or shackles, for they will bring humiliation.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The object of punishment is to bring her under the influence
of correcting law. Wilhelm/Baynes: Discipline: In order to give emphasis to
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

the law. Blofeld: Though it is advisable to apply discipline, this must be done in
accordance with just rules. Ritsema/Karcher: Using correcting laws indeed.
Cleary (1): It is beneficial to use punishments, by the correct method. [The
correct method of breaking down ignorance is not emotional attack.] Wu: It is
a method of correcting wayward behaviors.

Legge: The first line, magnetic, and at the bottom of the figure, is in the grossest
ignorance. Let her be punished. If punishment avails to loosen the shackles from
the mind, well and good. If not, and if the punishment is prolonged, the effect will
be bad.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the ignorant youth is being disciplined for the seriousness of
life. Care should be exercised against attempts at rigid regimentation of the mind.

Wing: A little discipline is necessary here. There is not enough seriousness of
attitude concerning the work to be done, and therefore the atmosphere is not
conducive to proper growth. Yet, keep in mind that too many restrictions may
lead to uncreative development. Apply just enough guidelines to keep things
moving in the proper direction.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all render "punishment" as "discipline." The
idea is that the discipline of a rigid structure, or confinement to basic principles
prunes the psyche of its illusions -- "removes the shackles from the mind."
Excessive discipline is counterproductive, however: A dynamic balance must be
sought between the tyrannies of permissiveness and repression. The line is saying
two things, and the balance between them is the lesson. If this is the only
changing line, the hexagram becomes number 41, Compensating Sacrifice,
which deals with finding balance. (Note, however that both of Cleary’s
translations interpret the message as a warning against removing shackles! His
interpretation seems to be in the minority.)

In reality the highest form of compassion may be in withdrawing from a
given person any direct physical aid that would spare him a painful
lesson, withholding it so that he would never again have to act according
to a particular kind of program. The best teachers know that compassion
does not prevent pain but allows pain to teach. Of course, carried to an
extreme this too can be used in the service of destruction.
John Lilly -- Simulations of God

A. Too much discipline is as bad as too little -- seek the mean.

B. The school of hard knocks -- learn from your pain or confusion.

C. Let go of your illusions or strongly held attitudes about the matter at
hand.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject exercising forbearance with
the ignorant, in which there will be good fortune; and admitting even the
goodness of women, which will also be fortunate. He may be described also as a
son able to sustain the burden of his family.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune. To
know how to take women brings good fortune. The son is capable of taking
charge of the household.

Blofeld: Being gentle with the immature brings good fortune. Taking a wife
brings good fortune. Sons will be capable of taking over the household affairs
when the strong (young) and the weak (old) are in mutual harmony.

Liu: To treat youth generously brings good fortune. Arranging a marriage brings
good fortune. The son can take over the household.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping Enveloping. Significant. Letting-in the wife.
Significant. The son controlling the dwelling.

Shaughnessy: Wrapping folly; auspicious. Sending in the wife; auspicious. The
son can marry.

Cleary (1): Taking in darkness is good, taking a wife is good; the heir ably takes
over the family affairs.

Cleary (2): It bodes well to embrace the ignorant. It bodes well to take a wife.
The child becomes head of the family.

Wu: Accommodating the ignorant is auspicious. It is also auspicious to take a
wife. A son will bring prosperity to the family.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is able to sustain the burden of his family because of the
reciprocation between this dynamic line and the magnetic fifth line. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Firm and yielding are in union. Blofeld: [No Confucian commentary
on this line, Ed.] Ritsema/Karcher: Solid and Supple articulating indeed.
Cleary (2): Firmness and flexibility meeting and joining. Wu: The strong-
minded and the softhearted have communicated with each other.

Legge: On the second line, dynamic and in the central place, devolves the task of
enlightening the ignorant with forbearance and humility. In proof of his
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

generosity he even receives or learns from weak and ignorant women. He appears
as the son taking his father's place.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is tolerant of the ignorant and kind to women. He resembles an
official capable of assuming the delegated duties of a prince in directing a large
social body with inner strength and outward reserve.

Wing: The person in this position has indeed developed in himself a true
appreciation of humanity in all of its folly and beauty. Such a person can lead
others with wisdom, compassion, and inspiration, and attain all the success
attributed to the great and wise historical leaders.

Editor: Because the I Ching is an empirically valid guide to ethical behavior, we
must interpret the sexist imagery in Legge and Wilhelm's version of this line as
intrapsychic symbolism. Ignorant: Aspects within the psyche resistant to
change. Women: Eros function, emotions, feelings. To "admit even the goodness
of women" is to acknowledge those feelings which nurture the psyche. Family:
The psyche. Son: The conscious ego. (Father = the Self.) Able to sustain the
burden of his family: Able to control psychic impulses.

From Sextus I learned a benevolent disposition, and the example of a
family governed in a fatherly manner ... And to tolerate ignorant
persons, and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the
power of readily accommodating himself to all.
Marcus Aurelius

A. You are competent to handle the situation.

B. The image suggests the consciously responsible management of
thoughts and feelings.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows that one should not marry a woman who,
when she sees a man of wealth, will not keep herself from him. In no way will
advantage come from her.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Take not a maiden who, when she sees a man of bronze,
loses possession of herself. Nothing furthers.

Blofeld: Do not choose a wife who, on seeing a wealthy man, cannot contain
herself. Nothing brings advantage. [This line, besides furnishing a specific
warning to those with marriage in view, means generally that this time is
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

unpropitious from the point of view of the enquirer, whatever his question may
concern.]

Liu: Do not choose a girl who, when she sees a rich man, loses her control. No
benefit.

Ritsema/Karcher: No availing-of grasping womanhood. Visualizing a metallic
husband. Not possessing the body. Without direction: Harvesting. [Without
direction: Harvesting, WU YU LI: no plan or direction is advantageous; in
order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events.]

Shaughnessy: Do not use to take a woman; see the metal fellow who does not
have a torso; there is no place beneficial.

Cleary(1): Don’t take this woman in marriage; if she sees a moneyed man, she’ll
lose herself. Nowhere beneficial.

Cleary(2): Do not take a girl to see a moneyed man, or she will lose herself, to
no one’s benefit.

Wu: Marry the woman not. When she sees a wealthy man, she cannot keep her
composure. Nothing good will come out of the marriage.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A woman such as is here represented should not be taken in
marriage -- her conduct is not agreeable to what is right. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
Her conduct is not in accord with order. Blofeld: Do not take to wife one whose
behavior is disorderly. Ritsema/Karcher: Movement not yielding indeed.
Cleary(2): Do not introduce the girl because his conduct is not harmonious.
Wu: her behavior is not beyond reproach.

Legge: The third line is magnetic and occupies a dynamic place beyond the
center. She separates the fourth line from the second, and the fifth line separates
her from her sixth line correlate. All these things give her a bad character.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man guards against the loss of his individuality. He should not imitate
persons of senior rank or act like a flippant girl throwing herself at a handsome
man. Neither should he accept overtures from such subordinates.

Wing: You are in danger of throwing yourself away in a foolish attempt to be
close to that which you fervently desire. Without strength of character and
individuality you can accomplish nothing meaningful in life.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Editor: In the symbolic language of the unconscious psyche, the female principle
is associated with Eros and the feelings. Line three depicts a woman unable to
control herself, and by analogy some form of inappropriate emotional expression,
desire or passion.

The study of epilepsy demonstrates conclusively that our feelings do not
necessarily depend on anything going on in the real world around us,
and that the strength of our feelings is not a measure of the authenticity
of our experiences or the credibility of our beliefs. We can “feel" strongly
about something and yet be dead wrong.
R. Restak -- The Brain

A. Don't throw yourself away: curb your urges, compulsions, impulses or
emotions.

B. An image of a bad deal or bad alliance.

C. Stop over-reacting to the situation at hand.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject as if bound in chains of
ignorance. There will be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Entangled youthful folly brings humiliation.

Blofeld: Obstinacy and immaturity cause harm. [This line may also be taken as
a warning against a too idealistic or visionary attitude.]

Liu: The youth beset by confusion. Humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Confining Enveloping. Abashment.

Shaughnessy: Bound folly; distress.

Cleary(1): Stuck in darkness, there is regret.

Cleary(2): Stuck in darkness, regretful.

Wu: Being besieged by ignorance is a cause for regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to her distance from the solidity shown in lines
two and six. Wilhelm/Baynes: This line of all things is furthest from what is
real. Blofeld: They harm us by leading us astray from the right course.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Ritsema/Karcher: Solitariness distancing substance indeed. Cleary (2): The
regret of being stuck in darkness is having strayed from reality on one’s own.
Wu: The subject is alone and far from the yang.

Legge: The fourth line is far from both the second and sixth, and can get no help
from her first line correlate who is as weak as she is. What good can be done with
or by her?

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Clinging to folly inevitably means humiliation. The wise teacher may have to
instruct by letting the subject experience the consequences of his errors.

Wing: Your fantasies and obsessions will consume you. Your attitude is
unrealistic in regard to what is really going on in your life and therefore you
cannot be instructed. You may ultimately be saved by experiencing fully the
humiliation that follows.

Editor: This is an image of confusion and illusion. In the best sense, it's a
counsel against making a foolish choice. (i.e., hopefully you haven't made it yet.)

Thus comes about what is called "loss of wings" or the "chaining" of the
soul. Its no longer are the ways of innocence in which ... it presided over
the higher realms. Life above was better by far than this. A thing fallen,
chained, at first barred off from intelligence and living only by sensation,
the soul is, as they say, in tomb or cavern pent.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. Illusion prevails -- you are totally out of touch with reality.

B. "Don't touch the tar baby."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject as a simple lass without
experience. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Childlike folly brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Youthful innocence brings good fortune. [Here the Chinese text
suggests that we are dealing not with youthful folly but with the innocent
misdemeanors of quite small children.]

Liu: The youth submits. Good fortune. [If you receive this line, you can expect
to attain your goals easily.]
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Ritsema/Karcher: Youthful Enveloping. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Youthful folly; auspicious.

Cleary(1): Innocence is auspicious.

Cleary(2): Innocent ignorance has a good outlook.

Wu: Being an ignorant lad will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY
Confucius/Legge: Her good fortune is due to her docility going on to humility.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune of the childlike fool comes from his being
devoted and gentle. Blofeld: This is because such conduct coincides with what
is soft and gentle. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding uses Ground indeed. Cleary
(2): Harmonizing smoothly. Wu: (This) is due to his docility and humility.

Legge: Line five is in the place of honor, and has for its correlate the dynamic
line in the second place. Being receptive, it is taken as the symbol of a simple lass,
willing to be taught by its dynamic correlate in line two.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The unassuming youth seeking instruction with humility gains good
fortune.

Wing: An attitude of innocent acceptance in regard to seeking advice from
others will be rewarded. Good fortune.

Editor: As so often in the I Ching, the full meaning of this line is found in the
relationship between it and its correlate. The second line is the dynamic sage,
and the fifth line is the magnetic (receptive) student. As the ruler of the
hexagram, line five exemplifies the idea of receptivity to instruction necessary for
the evolution of ignorance into gnosis. This is the relationship of the
inexperienced ego to the omniscient Self.

Sit down before fact like a little child, and be prepared to give up every
preconceived notion; follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses
nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.

    T. H. Huxley

A. "Awaken the mind by fixing it nowhere." -- Zen proverb.

B. Accept your ignorance and inexperience and humbly devote yourself to
comprehension of the Work.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows one smiting the ignorant youth. But no
advantage will come from doing him an injury. Advantage would come from
warding off injury from him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In punishing folly it does not further one to commit
transgressions. The only thing that furthers is to prevent transgressions.

Blofeld: In dealing with youthful immaturity, there is nothing to be gained from
doing what is wrong. Advantage lies in preventing wrong. [In other words, we
must be very careful to avoid putting ourselves in the wrong by being unjust or
too severe in correcting the faults of our juniors.]

Liu: To punish youth, it does no good to commit a violation. The idea is to
prevent a violation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Smiting Enveloping. Not Harvesting: activating outlawry.
Harvesting: resisting outlawry.

Shaughnessy: Hitting the folly; not beneficial to be a robber, beneficial to have
that which robs.

Cleary (1): Attacking darkness, what is not helpful is inimical, what is helpful
prevents enmity.

Cleary (2): Attack ignorance. It is not beneficial to be a robber; it is beneficial to
ward off robbers.

Wu: There is an indication of striking the ignorant. It will not be advantageous to
be offensive. It will be advantageous to be defensive.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Above and below all do and are done to in accordance with
their nature. Wilhelm/Baynes: "It furthers to prevent transgressions," for then
those above and below conform to order. Blofeld: Preventing wrong has the
advantage of bringing senior and junior into accord. [Improperly applied
discipline may lead the young to hate those whom they are expected to love. Few
young people gladly kiss the rod before punishment.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Above and Below yielding indeed. Cleary (2): It is beneficial to ward off robbers,
for then above and below are in harmony. Wu: Because it is agreeable to the
above and the below.
4 -- Inexperience -- 4

Legge: Line six is dynamic and in the topmost place. It is natural, but unwise, for
him to use violence in carrying out his educational measures. He represents,
according to the scheme of the hexagram, one who uses force in the cause of
education; but the force is best applied, not on the ignorant, but on those who
would keep them ignorant, or increase their ignorance. He therefore acts
according to his nature, and the subjects of all the magnetic lines below are cared
for as is best for them.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man inflicts penalties not in anger but only as a preventive against
unreasonable excesses.

Wing: An inexperienced person may need to be punished for his mistakes in
order to put him on the right path. Punishment is by no means an end in itself,
but is useful only in preventing further transgressions and maintaining a
progressive attitude.

Editor: The imagery of line six can suggest the idea of Karma: a law of just
compensation neutralizing past transgressions. In other words, "punishment" is
only effective when it is used to correct an imbalance of forces, not to perpetuate
injustice. Properly applied, discipline is never motivated by anger or a desire for
revenge. Sometimes this line can suggest a situation in which external
circumstances hold one in a kind of "protective custody" to prevent erroneous
choices from being made.

None escapes the chastisements that it is fitting to undergo because of evil
conduct. The divine law cannot be avoided. It has within itself the power
to achieve what it has determined upon. Without knowing it, the guilty
one is transported to places where it is suitable that it serve its sentence.
Carried by uncertain movement, drifting everywhere, it ends, after
wanderings and much fatigue because of foolish resistance, by tumbling
into its appropriate place. And there it offers itself willingly to an
unwilled suffering. Law prescribes the amount and duration of penalties.
At the same moment that the penalty ceases, the power is given of
escaping the place of chastisement thanks to the harmony that governs
all things.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. Correction is not punishment. Accept the consequences of your choices.
Don't focus on the pain, but rather on the lesson that it offers.

B. Do what needs doing and let the chips fall where they may.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIVE --
WAITING

Other titles: Nourishment, Calculated Inaction, Attending, Biding One's Time,
Nourishment Through Inaction, Waiting for Nourishment, Moistened, "Waiting
with the assurance that a blessing will come." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Waiting intimates that with sincerity and firmness there will be
brilliant success and good fortune. It will be advantageous to cross the great
stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting. If you are sincere, you have light and success.
Perseverance brings good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water.

Blofeld: Calculated inaction (or exhibiting the power to wait) and the
confidence of others win brilliant success. Righteous persistence brings good
fortune. It will be advantageous to cross the great river (or sea). [The
significance of this hexagram is that inaction while awaiting the outcome of
events will enable us to avoid a danger now threatening. Firmness, clarity of
mind and success in winning the confidence of others are now demanded of us;
with them, our undertakings will prosper. Moreover, this period of inaction is a
good time in which to go on a journey or else for relaxation and enjoyment.]

Liu: Waiting. If you are sincere you will have glory (light) and success.
Continuing leads to good fortune. It is of benefit to cross the great water (to travel
to remote places).

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending, possessing conformity. Shining Growing,
Trial: significant. Harvesting: wading the Great River. (Editor: "Possessing
conformity" is translated as: ... "Inner and outer are in accord; confidence of the
spirits has been captured...") [This hexagram describes your situation in terms
of being compelled to wait for and serve something. It emphasizes that fixing
your attention on what is required while waiting carefully for the right moment
to act is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are
told to: attend!]

Shaughnessy: Moistened: There is a return, radiant receipt; determination is
auspicious; beneficial to ford the great river.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Cleary (1): In Waiting there is sincerity and great development. It is good to
be correct. It is beneficial to cross a great river.

Cleary (2): Waiting with truthfulness lights up success in correct orientation
toward good. It is beneficial to cross a great river.

Wu: Waiting indicates having confidence. It is brilliant and pervasive and
auspicious to be persevering. It will be advantageous to cross the big river.

The Image

Legge: The image of clouds ascending over the sky forms Waiting. The
superior man, in accordance with this, eats and drinks, feasts and enjoys himself
as if there were nothing else to employ him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Clouds rise up to heaven: the image of Waiting. Thus the
superior man eats and drinks, is joyous and of good cheer.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes clouds rising to the zenith -- inactivity!
The Superior Man will pass this time in feasting and enjoyment.

Liu: Clouds rise up in the sky; this symbolizes Waiting. The superior man
enjoys his food and drink. He remains relaxed and happy.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above clouds with-respect-to heaven. Attending. A chun
tzu uses drinking [and] taking-in to repose delighting.

Cleary (1): Clouds rise to heaven, waiting. The superior person makes merry
with food and drink.

Wu: The clouds ascend to the sky; this is Waiting. Thus the jun zi enjoys food
and peace.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Waiting shows peril in front, but its subject does not allow
himself to be involved in the dangerous defile. The success in sincerity and good
fortune in firmness are shown by the position of the fifth line which is correctly
situated in the central place assigned by Heaven. Crossing the great stream will
be followed by meritorious achievement.

Legge: Waiting is composed of the lower trigram of strength and the upper
trigram of peril. Strength confronted by peril might be expected to advance boldly
and deal with it at once, but the lesson of the hexagram is that it is wiser to wait
until success is sure. In the situation at hand, firm correctness is all that is
required for eventual victory.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

"Crossing the great stream" is a frequent expression in the I Ching which
symbolizes the undertaking of hazardous enterprises, or encountering great
difficulties. Historically it refers to the Yellow River which the lords of Chou had
to cross in their revolution against the Yin Dynasty tyrants. The crossing made by
King Wu in 1122 B.C. was one of the greatest deeds in the history of China, and
was preceded by a long period of waiting until success could be assured.

Regarding the Image, it is said that the cloud that has risen to the top of
the sky has nothing to do but wait until the harmony of heaven and earth require
it to discharge its store of rain. The superior man is likewise counseled to enjoy
his idle time while waiting for the correct moment to deal with the approaching
danger.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Strength in the face of danger here consists of the will to sit tight
and do nothing.

The Superior Man carries on as if nothing was the matter, and nourishes
himself through inaction.

There are many kinds of courage -- perhaps the greatest of all is the
courage to remain unflinchingly in place when all the circumstances seem to cry
out for action. It takes far more courage to wait for the dragon to slowly come to
you than to rush forth and attack him in his lair. As a strategy, to out-wait your
opponent through pure willpower and inner strength can be more effective than a
direct attack -- but it can only succeed when you are truly strong. It is as if the
real battle takes place on the inner planes, and the first one to act in the world
thereby concedes defeat.

A very large part of the Work consists in disciplining oneself to wait -- to
take no action until some indefinite time in the future. This is exceedingly
difficult to do, and creates incredible stresses within the psyche -- which is exactly
why it is necessary. Psychologically, to "cross the great stream" is to subdue all of
the autonomous instincts, drives and emotions that are accustomed to
responding whenever they are stimulated. As long as waiting creates feelings of
stress, you can be sure that the battle has not been won. When you can wait like
the superior man -- as if there were nothing else to do, then you can allow
yourself to hope that you may be getting somewhere.

To nourish oneself through inaction is to digest and absorb the energy of
one's instinctive responses. As in any nourishing assimilation, their strength then
becomes your strength. The true adept is one who has digested all of his passion
and is thereby empowered to use it for his own purposes. Instead of engaging in
civil war, he has united his forces to act in the world.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Tradition says that Moses did not set the Tabernacle up straight away,
but delayed for three months, despite the fact that the people wanted to
dedicate it at once. In this is repeated a lesson of patience concerning
matters of the spirit. For instead of accepting their Teacher's word,
which conveyed the will of God, the Israelites sought to impose their own
will over what they had made ... This phenomenon is not unknown
among those who cannot wait, which is a vital part of esoteric training.
Unfortunately, it has to be demonstrated over and over again that the
timing of a spiritual event is contingent upon a cosmic schedule, and not
the will of the individual.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah and Exodus

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject waiting on the distant border. It
will be well for him to constantly maintain the purpose thus shown, in which case
there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting in the meadow. It furthers one to abide in what
endures. No blame.

Blofeld: Stay on the outskirts avoiding action. Constancy preserves from harm.

Liu: Waiting in the countryside. It is of benefit to continue. No regret.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending tending-towards the suburbs. Harvesting:
availing-of persevering. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Moistened in the pasture; beneficial to use constancy; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Waiting on the outskirts, it is beneficial to employ constancy; then
there is no fault.

Wu: He is waiting in the countryside. It will be advantageous for him to be
persistent and thus free from blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He makes no movement to encounter rashly the difficulties
of the situation. There will be no error if he constantly maintains his purpose --
he will not fail to pursue that regular course. Wilhelm/Baynes: One does not
seek out difficulties overhastily. One has not abandoned the general ground.
Blofeld: Not rushing forward to undertake what is difficult to perform. Doing
nothing out of the ordinary. Ritsema/Karcher: Not opposing heavy moving
indeed. Not-yet letting-go rules indeed. Cleary (2): One has not entered into
5 -- Waiting -- 5

difficult actions. One has not yet lost normalcy. Wu: Not to proceed toward
danger. Not to deviate from normal course.

Legge: The border means the frontier of the state. Line one appears at work in
his distant fields, not thinking of anything but his daily work, and he is advised to
abide in that state of mind. The "regular course" is the determination to maintain
a distance from danger and wait for the proper time to act.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, there is a suggestion of danger. The man remains calm,
concerns himself only with the immediate task at hand, and does not move to
counteract remote threats.

Wing: Do not become agitated by your sense of an impending problem. Live
your life as normally as possible and do nothing out of the ordinary. If there is a
problem, it exists in the future. Acknowledging it now could diminish your
strength.

Editor: A border is any threshold or boundary, such as the threshold between
the conscious and unconscious minds. As yet the danger has not crossed this line,
and we are advised not to go forth to meet it. Neither should we abandon our
position, but just quietly allow the situation to unfold and define itself.

Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, if it shall be
necessary, having with thee the same reason which now thou usest for
present things.
Marcus Aurelius

A. Sit tight and allow the situation to unfold.

B. "Let sleeping dogs lie."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject waiting on the sand of the
mountain stream. He will suffer the small injury of being spoken against, but in
the end there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting on the sand. There is some gossip. The end brings
good fortune.

Blofeld: Inactivity upon the river beach -- some slight gossip may arise, but the
final result will be good fortune. [Sitting on a river beach watching the water
flow past symbolizes watching what is going forward without taking part.]
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Liu: Waiting in the sand (seashore, bank of the river) arouses gossip. Good
fortune in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending tending-towards sands. The small possesses
words. Completing significant.

Shaughnessy: Moistened in the sand; there are a few words; in the end
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Waiting on the sand, there is some criticism, but it turns out well.

Wu: He is waiting on the sand. He may hear little complaints. Eventually, there
will be good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He occupies his place in the center with a generous
forbearance. He will bring things to a good issue. Wilhelm/Baynes: One is
calm, for the line is central. Although this leads to some gossip, the end brings
good fortune. Blofeld: The first sentence indicates a place with water flowing
through the middle. Though there be gossip, all will be well in the end.
Ritsema/Karcher: Overflowing located in the center indeed. Although the
small possesses words, using completing significant indeed. Cleary (2): There is
useless excess within. Though there is some criticism, it is to make the end
auspicious. Wu: Indicates having forbearance. It will end with good fortune.

Legge: The sand of line two suggests a nearer approach to the defile, but he is
still self-restrained and waiting. That he is a dynamic line in a magnetic and
central place shows him to be possessed of a large and generous forbearance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The danger approaches with disagreements and unrest. The man remains
self-controlled and does not respond to slander.

Wing: What you propose to do will bring difficulties into your life. Furthermore,
you could become a victim of gossip. If this occurs, don't try to defend yourself, as
it will only lend weight to what is otherwise insubstantial. Success will eventually
come.

Editor: "Sand” often symbolizes time -- the innumerable petty details of life, or
the inexorable wearing away of hours, minutes, seconds. When combined with
the image of a river bank (Legge, Blofeld, Liu), the notion of waiting for time and
events to fulfill themselves is further emphasized. Psychologically, to be "spoken
against" refers to the impatient urging of the instinctual-emotional part of the
psyche which demands immediate gratification of every current desire. Wilhelm
renders "being spoken against" as "gossip," which is rumor, speculation or
5 -- Waiting -- 5

imagination. (Cleary’s Buddhist text calls it “criticism.”) To exercise a “generous
forbearance” means to endure and ignore these illusion-obsessed inner voices.
Blofeld's note about "watching what is going forward without taking part” is
especially insightful: the line often portrays a situation in which one is required
by circumstances to be an inactive observer. If this is the only changing line, the
new hexagram created is number 63, Completion, suggesting that passive
contemplation is linked with fulfillment of the Work.

When Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to this song of a
thousand voices; when he did not listen to the sorrow or laughter, when
he did not bind his soul to any one particular voice and absorb it in his
Self, but heard them all, the whole, the unity; then the great song of a
thousand voices consisted of one word: Om -- perfection.
Hermann Hesse -- Siddhartha

A. Contemplate the unfolding situation: restrain your impulse to meddle,
even if action seems necessary.

B. For the moment, maintain the status quo.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject in the mud close by the stream.
He thereby invites the approach of injury.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting in the mud brings about the arrival of the enemy.

Blofeld: Inactivity amidst the mud -- this permits the approach of evil. [This
suggests a danger of our being so bogged down that we can neither fight nor
flee.]

Liu: Waiting in the mud brings on the enemy.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending tending-towards bogs. Involving outlawry
culminating.

Shaughnessy: Moistened in the mud; it causes robbers to arrive.

Cleary (1): Waiting in the mud brings on enemies.

Wu: He is waiting in the mud. This invites harm.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is waiting in the mud -- the calamity in the upper trigram
is close at hand. He invites the approach of injury, but if he is reverent and
5 -- Waiting -- 5

careful, he will not be worsted. Wilhelm/Baynes: The misfortune is outside.
Seriousness and caution prevent defeat. Blofeld: Remaining inactive in the
midst of mud subjects us to external dangers, but the approaching evil will not
harm us if we exercise care. [We must not allow the mud to bog us down.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Calamity located outside indeed. Originating-from my
involving outlawry. Respectful consideration, not destroying indeed. Cleary (2):
Once I have brought on enemies, I am careful not to be defeated. Wu: Inviting
harm is a self-inflicted act. With respect and caution, however, he will be free
from defeat.

Legge: Here the subject is on the brink of the stream. His advance to this
position has provoked resistance which may result in his injury.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attempts a complex undertaking without sufficient capacity for
success in one try. He finds himself mired in the intricacies, thereby inviting
enemies onto the scene. Caution is required.

Wing: Because of premature action on your part, inspired perhaps by anxiety,
you will leave yourself open to attack. This situation is truly difficult because you
are vulnerable. Only extreme caution will protect you.

Editor: In its most neutral interpretation, this line is an image of serious
vulnerability: an unstable position invites attack. Mud is earth mixed with water.
Psychologically, sensation (earth) and emotion (water) unite in a gooey morass of
fear or anxiety which leaves one vulnerable to harm. Since the Work proceeds
dialectically upward or downward, this position points out the danger of
emotional responses: you could lose what you have gained unless you hold firm.
Don't surrender to the complexes urging differentiation: heed the gnosis which
counsels integration.

Instinctive reactions and emotional expressions thus shade imperceptibly
into each other. Every object that excites an instinct excites an emotion as
well.
William James

A. Emotional vulnerability threatens the ego's ability to act effectively.

B. You're on shaky footing -- take care.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject waiting in the place of blood.
But she will get out of the cavern.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting in blood. Get out of the pit.

Blofeld: Inactivity amidst blood -- we shall emerge from the abyss.

Liu: Waiting in blood. Come out from the pit.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending tending-towards blood. Issuing- forth originates-
from the cave.

Shaughnessy: Moistened in the blood; it comes out from the cavity.

Cleary(1): Waiting in blood. Leaving the cave.

Wu: He is waiting in blood. He exits from the cave.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She accommodates herself to the circumstances of the time,
and hearkens to its requirements. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is yielding and obeys.
Blofeld: To abstain from action amidst deeds of blood is to accord with the
principle of allowing things to take their course. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding
uses hearkening indeed. Cleary (2): Means listening receptively. Wu: Waiting
in blood calls for obedience.

Legge: Line four has passed from the lower to the upper trigram and entered the
scene of danger and strife: "the place of blood." However, she is magnetic and in
her correct place, so she withdraws from engagement with the enemy and is
thereby enabled to escape from the cavern. Recognition of the circumstances of
the time and yielding to its requirements are the lessons here. She acknowledges
her inadequacies and takes the prudent step.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man enters the scene of strife and danger in a life and death struggle.
He accommodates himself to fate, stands fast, and refrains from aggravating the
problem.

Wing: You are waiting in the very center of chaos. Any sort of confrontation with
the problems that present themselves will only make things worse. Remove
yourself immediately and unobtrusively from the situation.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, this line sometimes implies that during a
transitional phase in the dialectical process of individuation one must avoid any
influence that might interfere with that process. Each translator uses a different
word for what may be interpreted as an image of the unconscious psyche:
"cavern," "pit," "abyss," "cave" and "cavity" all describe a hidden, dark,
dangerous influence in the situation at hand.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

For the ordinary esoteric aspirant the best approach to the evil within us
is, after having recognized and faced it, to starve it, working only upon
the development of the good and spiritual qualities. By developing the
contact of the Spirit the psyche will eventually be so transformed that
there is no room for evil within it. Direct work upon evil forces will tend
to set up a polarity and occult link with these forces and this is one thing
which must be sedulously avoided.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. Withdraw from a dangerous position.

B. "Don't touch it with a ten-foot pole!"

C. Wait until the situation clarifies.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject waiting amidst the appliances of
a feast. Through his firmness and correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Waiting at meat and drink. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: Inactivity amidst food and wine -- righteous persistence will bring good
fortune. [We may safely relax and enjoy ourselves, but we must preserve our
determination to act when the time is ripe.]

Liu: Waiting at the feast. Continuing brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attending tending-towards liquor taken-in. Trial:
significant.

Shaughnessy: Moistened in the wine and food; determination is auspicious.

Cleary(1): Waiting with food and wine, it is good to be correct.

Wu: He is waiting at feasting. Perseverance brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is indicated by his being in the central
and correct place. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because of the central and correct
character. Blofeld: The line is a firm one between two yielding lines.
Ritsema/Karcher: Using centering correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Being
centered correctly. Wu: Central and correct.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Legge: Line five is dynamic in the central and correct place of the ruler. All good
qualities therefore belong to him. He has triumphed, and with firmness will
continue to triumph.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man fortifies his reserve strength by enjoying the intervals of peace
between crises. At the same time he maintains his orientation to the ultimate goal
with optimistic buoyancy.

Wing: Your difficulties are held in abeyance now and it is a good time to relax
and gain perspective on the situation. While you enjoy your respite, keep in mind
that there is still much to be done in the attainment of your goals.

Editor: This line recalls the Image -- the superior man "eats and drinks, feasts
and enjoys himself as if there were nothing else to employ him." If this is the
only changing line, the hexagram becomes number eleven: Harmony --
suggesting that one is situated very well indeed.

A meditating man may appear, at a glance, to be doing nothing. But as
with Buddha seated under his Bohdi tree, this apparent physical inaction
hid the cosmic activity of inner illumination.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- An Introduction to the Cabala

A. You are surrounded by nourishing influences – relax and allow the
situation to mature.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject entered into the cavern. But
there are three guests coming, without being urged, to help her. If she receives
them respectfully, there will be good fortune in the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One falls into the pit. Three uninvited guests arrive. Honor
them, and in the end there will be good fortune.

Blofeld: Entering a pit. Three uninvited guests arrive; to honor them will
ultimately bring good fortune.

Liu: Entering the pit, three unexpected guests arrive. Treat them courteously.
Good fortune in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Entering tending-towards the cave. Possessing not urging's
visitors. Three people coming. Respecting them: completing significant.
5 -- Waiting -- 5

Shaughnessy: Entering into the cavity; there are unbidden guests, three men,
who come; respect them; in the end auspicious.

Cleary (1): Entering a cave. Three people come, guests not in haste: Respect
them, and it will turn out well.

Cleary (2): ... Three unhurried guests come ... etc.

Wu: He enters the cave. There come three uninvited guests. To receive them
with respect will be auspicious in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There has been no great failure in what has been done.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Although the line is not in its proper place, at least no great
mistake is made. Blofeld: Nothing is lost by it. [There is a Chinese proverb
which runs: `Being over-courteous excites no blame from others.'] Ritsema/
Karcher: Not-yet the great let-go indeed. Cleary (2): Even though you do not
reach rank, still you have not lost much. Wu: Although his position is not
tenable, he has not faulted badly.

Legge: The magnetic sixth line has entered deeply into the cavern. Her correlate
third line comes with two dynamic companions from the lower trigram to give
help. If they are respectfully received, that help will prove effectual.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man falls into great complications. Everything looks black. But
unexpected help arrives. If he is sensitive to it and accepts it graciously, there will
be a happy turn of events.

Wing: The time is complex. The waiting is over because the difficulties are upon
you. There appears to be no way out of the situation. Yet help arrives if you
recognize it. To know and graciously accept such unexpected and unfamiliar
assistance will turn the entire situation toward the good.

Editor: A cavern, a narrow, dark and restricted place, can refer to ignorance as
well as danger. However, things here are not as dark as they may appear and the
issue will improve if you are receptive to a solution. Waiting is the subjective
experience of the passage of time. If time and consciousness are in some ways
synonymous, then "waiting” implies the interval between ignorance and
enlightenment.

What is experienced only in terms of a personal impasse can seem quite
hopeless until and unless it receives a general human meaningfulness by

5 -- Waiting -- 5

being recognized as one's individual and perhaps discordant share in, or
variation of, a general theme of human striving and seeking.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. The working out of an impasse -- respect the process by allowing it to
unfold naturally.

B. “It is always darkest before the dawn."

6 -- Stress -- 6
HEXAGRAM NUMBER SIX --
STRESS

Other titles: Conflict, The Symbol of Contention, Strife, Litigation, Quarreling,
Arguing, Lawsuit, "It is important to mind one's step at the very beginning then
things will have a chance to work out all right." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Stress indicates that despite sincere motivations, one still meets with
opposition and obstruction. Maintain an apprehensive caution. To prosecute the
contention to the bitter end will produce evil results. It is advantageous to see the
Great Man. It is not advantageous to cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Conflict. You are sincere and are being obstructed. A
cautious halt halfway brings good fortune. Going through to the end brings
misfortune. It furthers one to see the great man. It does not further one to cross
the great water.

Blofeld: Conflict. Confidence accompanied by obstacles! With care, affairs can
be made to prosper in their middle course, but the final outcome will be disaster.
It is advantageous to visit a great man, but not to cross the great river (or sea). [In
general, this hexagram indicates that we have little chance of success in any
conflict, dispute or lawsuit in which we are now engaged and that retreat is the
best policy -- unless line one or five is a moving line, in which case the position
is more hopeful. We can profit from the advice of someone truly wise, but a
journey of any kind at this time would be disastrous.]

Liu: Conflict; you have sincerity even though obstructed, stop halfway -- good
fortune; follow to the end -- misfortune. It is of benefit to see a great man, but not
to cross the great water.

Ritsema/Karcher: Arguing, possessing conformity. Blocking awe.
Centering significant. Completing: pitfall. Harvesting: visualizing Great People.
Not Harvesting: wading the Great River. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of a dispute. It emphasizes that actively expressing your
claims and objections is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the
time, you are told to argue!] (Sic)

Shaughnessy: Lawsuit: There is a return; pitying and tranquil, it succeeds to
be auspicious, but in the end is inauspicious; beneficial herewith to see the great
man; not beneficial to ford the great river.
6 -- Stress -- 6

Cleary (1): Contention; there is blockage of truth. Caution and moderation
lead to good results, finality leads to bad results. It is beneficial to see a great
person, not beneficial to cross a great river.

Cleary (2): ...Wariness within leads to good results, but ending up that way is
unfortunate ... etc.

Wu: Litigation indicates an obstruction of trust. If the subject is vigilant, he
will have good fortune. If he is libelous to the end, he will face foreboding. It will
be advantageous to see the great man. It will not be advantageous to cross the big
river.

The Image

Legge: The image of water moving away from heaven forms Stress. The
superior man, in accordance with this, takes good counsel about the beginning of
any enterprise.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven and water go their opposite ways: the image of
Conflict. Thus in all his transactions the superior man carefully considers the
beginning.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes sky and water in opposition. The Superior
Man does not embark upon any affair until he has carefully planned the start.

Liu: Heaven and water go in different directions, symbolizing Conflict. The
superior man contemplates the beginning before undertaking an enterprise.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven associating-with stream, contradicting movements.
Arguing, a chun tzu uses arousing affairs to plan beginning.

Cleary (1): When heaven and water go in different directions, there is
contention. Superior people plan in the beginning when they do things.

Cleary (2): ... When leaders do things, they plan to begin with.

Wu: Heaven and water go in opposite directions; this is Litigation. Thus the
jun zi plans well before taking actions.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The coming together of Strength and Peril gives the idea of
Stress. A dynamic line in the central place in the lower trigram shows how there
will be good fortune if one maintains apprehensive caution; but because
contention should not be taken to extremes, there will be evil if one prosecutes
6 -- Stress -- 6

his contention to the bitter end. The great man sets a value on the due mean. If
one attempts to cross the great stream, he finds himself in an abyss.

Legge: The upper trigram of Strength here controls the lower trigram of Peril
which is trying to attack it. Or it may also be seen as someone in a perilous
situation contending with strong outside forces. The image is of contention and
strife. The sincere yang line in the middle of the trigram of Peril gives a character
to the whole figure -- an individual so represented will be very cautious and have
good fortune. But since contention is bad, even a sincere individual must fail if he
pursues it to the bitter end. The fifth line represents the great man, whose agency
is sure to be good. His decision in any matter of contention will be correct. The
sixth line is also dynamic, but his action is likely to be too rash for a great
enterprise, hence the warning about not attempting to cross the great stream.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Be careful, don't attempt much, and don't allow the situation to get
out of hand.

The Superior Man is judicious about his choices of action to ensure that the
situation remains stable.

The hexagram portrays a high level of tension. Wilhelm points out that the
only "favorable" line is the ruler in the fifth place, and that all of the other lines
symbolize people quarreling. It should also be noted that lines one through four
counsel either retreat from contention or remaining passively in place. Only line
five suggests that an active struggle can have a favorable outcome, and line six
portrays the sorry fate of those who insist on "demanding their rights." If we turn
the hexagram upside down we have Waiting, which suggests some subtle truths
about the proper way to handle stress.

He who has a taste for dispute has a taste for blows,
the man of haughty speech courts destruction.
Proverbs 17: 19

At deciding lawsuits I am no better than anyone else; but what is
necessary is to bring about a state of affairs in which there will be no
lawsuits.
Confucius

Note that Ritsema/Karcher's summation of the Judgment stands in stark
disagreement with the general tenor of the figure: I have never received this
hexagram when that interpretation has applied.
6 -- Stress -- 6
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject not perpetuating the matter
about which the contention is. She will suffer the small injury of being spoken
against, but the end will be fortunate.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one does not perpetuate the affair, there is a little gossip.
In the end, good fortune comes.

Blofeld: Provided that affairs are not pressed through to the end and that as
little as possible is said about them, they will end propitiously.

Liu: One does not continue the affair (conflict). Even if there is some gossip,
good fortune in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not a perpetual place, affairs. The small possesses words,
completing significant.

Shaughnessy: Not permitting where it serves; there are a few words; in the end
auspicious.

Cleary (1): One does not persist forever in an affair. There will be a little
criticism, but it will turn out well.

Wu: Contention can never produce results. Although there are small talks about
him, the outcome will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Contention should not be prolonged. Although she may
suffer the small injury of being spoken against, her argument is clear. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One must not prolong the conflict. The matter is finally decided clearly.
Blofeld: This implies not dragging on a dispute. Though little should be said, its
purport should be clear. Ritsema/Karcher: Arguing not permitting long-living
indeed. Although the small possesses words, one's differentiation brightening
indeed. Cleary (2): The explanation is clear. Wu: Clarification will bring about
understanding.

Legge: Line one is magnetic at the bottom of the figure. She may suffer
somewhat in the nascent strife, but will let it drop to good effect.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man refrains from contention during the initial stages of
strife. He suffers little. But he knows that he needs to walk together with his
associates and cannot advance alone.
6 -- Stress -- 6

Wing: Your position is such that you must avoid any Conflict or terminate it
quickly. Don't try to bring things to a decision or engage yourself in a dispute.
You may feel a little victimized, but in the end all goes well.

Editor: This is a clear injunction to abandon the subject of contention or your
line of questioning. The "gossip" sometimes refers to the inner clamoring of hurt
pride or bruised ego.

As well loose a flood as initiate legal proceedings; break off before the
dispute begins.
Proverbs 17: 14

A. Drop the subject, or stop what you're doing.

B. Cease and desist -- don't allow the conflict to continue.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject unequal to the contention. If
he conceals himself where the inhabitants of his city are only three hundred
families, he will fall into no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One cannot engage in conflict; one returns home, gives way.
The people of his town, three hundred households, remain free of guilt.

Blofeld: As the conflict cannot be resolved, he beats a hasty retreat. His clan,
numbering three hundred households, also escapes harm. [This sentence may
have been taken from some ancient writing known to readers of the Book of
Change at that time. In divination, unless it obviously has some bearing on the
case, it may be disregarded, or else interpreted symbolically without paying
much regard to the number three hundred.]

Liu: One cannot continue in the conflict. Retreating, he goes home. Three
hundred families in his town will avoid disaster.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not controlling Arguing. Converting and-also escaping
one's capital. People, three hundred doors. Without blunder.

Shaughnessy: Not succeeding at the lawsuit; returning and fleeing, three
hundred households of his city people are without inspection.

Cleary (1): Not pressing one’s contention, one returns home to escape: If there
are three hundred families in one’s domain, there will be no trouble.
6 -- Stress -- 6

Cleary (2): Not victorious in contention, one goes home and hides. The local
people number 300 families. There is no mistake or calamity.

Wu: He is not to win the litigation, He returns home to hide. The three hundred
families in his village are not implicated.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is unequal to the contention; he retires and keeps
concealed, stealthily withdrawing from it -- for him in his lower place to contend
with the stronger one above would be to invite calamity, as if he brought it with
his hand to himself. Wilhelm/Baynes: Thus one escapes. To contend from a
lowly place with someone above brings self- incurred suffering. Blofeld: This
passage means that, if we pit ourselves against superior strength, we shall find
ourselves bowed beneath the dint of conflict to the bitter end. Ritsema/
Karcher: Converting escaping, skulking indeed. Below origin, above Arguing.
Distress culminating, reaping indeed. Cleary (2): (None) Wu: When a
subordinate brings a lawsuit against his superior; his loss is unavoidable.

Legge: Line two is dynamic in a magnetic place and no match for his fifth-line
adversary who is dynamic in a dynamic place, and the ruler to boot. That he
retires from contention to an insignificant village of only three hundred people
shows his humility.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is warned about contending against a superior or more powerful
enemy. A conciliatory and timely retreat precludes personal disaster.

Wing: Your adversary is superior in strength. Do not allow your pride or sense of
honor to draw you into open Conflict. Retreat and you will avoid a disastrous
outcome for yourself and those close to you.

Editor: "Discretion is the better part of valor" -- there is nothing to be gained by
fighting a battle you cannot win.

If all the countries he knows or hears about follow a way that is not good,
as in our time, or if because of military campaigns or illness, he is unable
to go to a city with good customs, he shall dwell alone in solitude. As it is
said: "Let him dwell alone and be silent."
Maimonides

A. "You can't fight city hall."

B. Disengage from the situation at hand to preserve your forces intact.
6 -- Stress -- 6
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping in the old place
assigned for her support, and firmly correct. Perilous as the position is, there will
be good fortune in the end. Should she perchance engage in the king's business,
she will not claim the merit of achievement.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.
Danger. In the end good fortune comes. If by chance you are in the service of a
king, seek not works.

Blofeld: He nourishes himself on the ancient virtues. Right determination leads
to initial trouble followed by good fortune. Were he to seek public office now, he
would not be able to attain it.

Liu: Depending upon ancient virtues. Continuing in this way leads to danger. In
the end, good fortune. While working in public affairs, one should not seek
achievement.

Ritsema/Karcher: Taking-in ancient actualizing-tao. Trial. Adversity,
completing significant. Maybe adhering-to kingly affairs: without
accomplishment. [Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the course traced by the
ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which
makes a being become what it is meant to be. Adversity (LI): Danger,
threatening, malevolent demon ... It indicates a spirit or ghost that seeks
revenge by inflicting suffering upon the living. Pacifying or exorcizing such a
spirit can have a healing effect.]

Shaughnessy: Eating old virtue; determination is dangerous. Someone follows
the king's service, without completion.

Cleary (1): Living on past virtues, rectitude in danger will turn out well. If
working in government, do not do anything.

Cleary (1): ... If you are upright in danger, the end will be auspicious. If you
pursue political affairs, nothing will be accomplished.

Wu: Living by the traditional virtue and being correct and firm will bring good
fortune in the end. Should he enter into public service, he does not expect
recognition of his success.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She confines herself to the support assigned to her of old;
thus following those above, she will have good fortune. Wilhelm/Baynes: To
obey the one above brings good fortune. Blofeld: The good fortune will result
6 -- Stress -- 6

from obedience to superiors which stems from cherishing the ancient virtues.
Ritsema/Karcher: Adhering-to the above significant indeed. Cleary (2):
Living on past virtues is the luck of following the high. Wu: Following those
above him will be auspicious.

Legge: Here the line is magnetic in a dynamic place and thus unequal to the
stress of the matter at hand. She withdraws from the arena, and even if forced
into action she will stay safely in the background. "She keeps in the old place
assigned for her support" literally means: "She eats her own virtue." That is, she
nourishes herself on her own natural endowment and does not contend for more
than that.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man lives on income received for services rendered. He recognizes that
works really belonging to oneself cannot be taken away. He does not engage in
perilous contests over property.

Wing: Keep a low profile. Stick to established methods and traditional virtues.
Do not put yourself in a position of prominence whatever you imagine to gain in
prestige. Material possessions and status mean nothing now. Only your inner
worth will be of value to you.

Editor: "Ancient virtues" suggest the principles of the Work, or the archetype of
the psyche as an integrated whole. Symbolically, to "engage in the king's
business" is to undertake the Work on behalf of the Self. Note the similarity
between this line and the third line of Hexagram number two, The Magnetic.

If you want to be a good servant within the divine plan or salvation of the
world, you must never forget that you do not live and work on your own
strength. All power comes from God, and all powers you manifest come
to you from your highest self -- from God.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

A. Don't aspire beyond your proper place. Maintain a servant's humility
and, though it may not be apparent now, your commitment to the Work will
eventually bear fruit.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject unequal to the contention. He
returns to the study of Heaven's ordinances, changes his wish to contend, and
rests in being firm and correct. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One cannot engage in conflict. One turns back and submits
to fate, changes one's attitude, and finds peace in perseverance. Good fortune.
6 -- Stress -- 6

Blofeld: Since the conflict cannot be resolved, it is best to retreat and submit to
heaven's will. Peaceful determination brings good fortune.

Liu: One cannot continue the conflict. Returning and changing one's attitude
brings peace and good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not controlling Arguing. Returning, approaching fate.
Denying quiet Trial. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Not succeeding at the lawsuit; returning and attending to the
command, it changes to peace; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Not pressing one’s contention, one abides by the decree of fate:
Changing to rest in rectitude leads to good fortune.

Cleary (2): Contending unvictorious, return to destiny, change to rest in
rectitude; then the outlook is good.

Wu: He is not to win the litigation. If his mind returns to reasoning and changes
for the good, he will find comfort in being correct. It will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He does not fail in doing what is right. Wilhelm/Baynes:
Thus nothing is lost. Blofeld: Provided we submit to heaven's will, peaceful
determination will enable us to win through. Ritsema/Karcher: Not letting-go
indeed. Cleary (2): Means not getting lost. Wu: Because there will be no error.

Legge: Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place which is not central -- he has a
mind to contend in a position from which he cannot hope to win. Above him is
the strong ruler with whom it is hopeless to strive, and below him is his weak ally
in the first place from whom no help can be expected. Hence he takes the course
indicated, which leads to good fortune. The returning to the study of Heaven's
ordinances and changing the wish to contend are not two things, but one. The
ordinances are what is right in principle, and since the wish to contend was
wrong in principle, it is now abandoned.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man thinks that belligerency toward his weaker opponents will
succeed. But lacking righteousness, he fails in his endeavors. Returning from the
path of strife to one of inner harmony with the eternal law, he finds peace and
good fortune.

Wing: You might see where you could improve your position by engaging in
Conflict with a weaker element. The fact is, though, that you cannot gain inner
6 -- Stress -- 6

satisfaction from such strategies. Returning to a sense of dignity and inner worth
coupled with an acceptance of your fate will bring you peace of mind and good
fortune.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the image suggests a situation in which the
ego is not yet ready to encounter certain forces involved in the Work. The lesson
is to return to an attitude of receptivity to instruction: “Heaven's ordinances.”

It is proper for a man to overlook all the things of the world, for
according to those who understand, everything is vain and empty and
not worth taking vengeance for.
Maimonides

A. Tame your impulse to act and learn from your restricted situation. "All
things come to him who waits."

B. You can't do anything now, so don't even try.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject contending -- and with great
good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To contend before him brings supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: Conflict followed by supreme good fortune.

Liu: Conflict. To submit the conflict to a great man brings great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Arguing. Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Lawsuit; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): Contend; it will be very auspicious.

Wu: There is great fortune in Litigation.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is shown by his holding the due mean and being in the
correct place. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because he is central and correct. Blofeld:
This is indicated by the fitting position of the central line. Ritsema/Karcher:
Using centering correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Contention is very auspicious
when it is balanced and correct. Wu: Because of its central and correct position.

Legge: Line five has every circumstance in his favor.
6 -- Stress -- 6
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man acts in moderation. By being in the right place he is on the road to
good fortune. A just and powerful arbiter may be invited to mediate.
Circumstances are in his favor.

Wing: Bring your Conflict before a powerful and just authority. If you are in the
right, the situation will end in good fortune and success.

Editor: Because this is the ruler of the hexagram, it is portrayed as a wise judge
who settles the matter of contention justly. If it is the only changing line, the new
hexagram becomes number 64, Unfinished Business, with its corresponding
line depicting a moral victory. One sometimes receives this figure in situations
involving third-party arbitration.

If he attains the virtue of the long sword, one man can beat ten men. Just
as one man can beat ten, so a hundred can beat a thousand, and a
thousand can beat ten thousand.
Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. An affirmation or victory of some sort is indicated.

B. Your argument is persuasive.

C. Seek wise counsel.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows how its subject may have the leather belt
conferred on him by the sovereign, and thrice it shall be taken from him in a
morning.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one, by the
end of a morning it will have been snatched away three times.

Blofeld: If a girdle of honor were bestowed upon him, he would be forced to
strip it off thrice within one day.

Liu: Even if he receives an ornamental belt, it will be snatched away three
times in one morning.

Ritsema/Karcher: Maybe bestowing's pouched belt. Completing dawn three-
times depriving it.
6 -- Stress -- 6

Shaughnessy: Someone awards him a leather belt, by the end of the morning
thrice strips it.

Cleary (1): Even if one is given a badge of honor, it will be taken away thrice
before the day is out.

Wu: He may have been presented with a leather belt. He flaunts it three times in
one day.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He receives a reward through his contention, but still he is
not deserving of respect. Wilhelm/Baynes: To attain distinction through
conflict is, after all, nothing to command respect. Blofeld: Garments of honor
obtained through strife do little credit to the wearer. [Note: In divination,
garments of honor may be taken to symbolize any of the prizes obtained
through a successful dispute.] Ritsema/Karcher: Using Arguing acquiesces-in
submitting. Truly not standing respectfully indeed. Cleary (2): Not worthy of
honor. Wu: Nothing worthy of respect.

Legge: Line six is dynamic and able to contend successfully, but is there to be no
end of striving? Persistence in it is sure to end in defeat and disgrace. The
contender here might receive a reward from the king for his success, but if he
received it thrice in a morning, thrice it would be taken away from him again.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man gains repeated rewards from exhaustive conflicts. But the
happiness does not last. The respect is undeserved, and the attacks continue
without end.

Wing: If you engage now in forceful Conflict, it is possible you will emerge
victorious. However, you will have created a situation of unending contest. Again
and again, your position will be challenged. Such triumphs are ultimately
meaningless.

Editor: This images a situation in which one may win the battle but lose the war
-- a meaningless victory. The line is sometimes received when you are
importuning the oracle for information it will not divulge: saying, in effect, "Even
if your question were answered, you wouldn't be able to understand it."

For everyone fights for his own falsity and calls it truth ... These, because
they can receive nothing of light from heaven, and can therefore
inwardly see nothing within themselves, are for the most part ... such as
believe nothing but what they see with their eyes and touch with their
hands. Hence all the fallacies of the senses to them are truths; and it is
from these that they dispute.
Swedenborg -- Heaven and Hell

6 -- Stress -- 6

A. An illusory gain is a net loss. It's impossible to win in a no-win situation.

B. You would rather be right than charitable.

C. You are trying too hard -- stop now.

July 4, 2001, 4/23/06
7 -- Discipline -- 7
HEXAGRAM NUMBER SEVEN --
DISCIPLINE

Other titles: The Army, The Symbol of Multitude and of Army, Legions/
Leading, The Troops, Collective Force, Discipline, Soldiers, Group Action, A
Disciplined Multitude, Ego Discipline, Willpower "Can refer to mourning but its
essential meaning is Discipline." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Discipline indicates that with firm correctness and a leader of age and
experience, there will be good fortune and no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Army. The army needs perseverance and a strong
man. Good fortune without blame.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings to those in authority good
fortune and freedom from error. [If the enquiry is not concerned with military
affairs, we must interpret this hexagram symbolically in the sense that life is a
battle.]

Liu: The Army. The army demands perseverance and a strong person (leader).
Good fortune. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Legions: Trial. Respectable people significant. Without
fault. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of unorganized crowds
or bunches of things. It emphasizes that organizing these things into functional
units is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are
told to lead!]

Shaughnessy: The Troops: Determination for the senior man is auspicious;
there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): For the leader of the army to be right, a mature person is good;
then there is no error.

Wu: The Army indicates persevering. Led by the elder man, it will be
auspicious.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

The Image

Legge: Water in the midst of the earth -- the image of Discipline. The superior
man nourishes and educates the people, and collects from among them a mighty
army.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In the middle of the earth is water: the image of The Army.
Thus the superior man increases his masses by generosity toward the people.

Blofeld: The symbol of water surrounded by land. The Superior Man nourishes
the people and treats them with leniency.

Liu: Water in the earth symbolizes the Army. The superior man increases his
followers by benevolence toward the people.

Ritsema/Karcher: Earth center possessing stream. Legions. A chun tzu uses
tolerating commoners to accumulate crowds.

Cleary (1): There is water in the earth, The Army. Thus does the superior
person embrace the people and nurture the masses.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders develop a group by admitting people.

Wu: There is water underneath the ground; this is The Army. Thus the jun zi
receives people and shelters them.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Discipline describes the masses who make up the army,
and the firm correctness referred to means a morally correct intent. When the
leader uses the masses with such correctness, he may fulfill the ruler's will. The
focus of strength in the second line is responded to by his proper correlate in the
ruler's place. Although action is dangerous, it accords with the best sentiments of
men, and although the leader may distress the country the people will still follow
him -- there will be good fortune and no error.

Legge: Discipline is symbolized here by the conduct of a military expedition.
The arrangement of the lines suggests the idea of a general surrounded by his
troops. The dynamic yang line in the center of the lower trigram has the
confidence of the magnetic ruler in the fifth place. Entire trust is reposed in him
because he is strong and correct. He is referred to as an old and experienced
man, hence all of his enterprises will succeed.

Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and Docility or
Accordance with Others, that of the upper. War is like poison to a country --
painful, and potentially ruinous, and yet the people will endure it on behalf of the
sovereign whom they love and respect.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

In regard to the Image, Chu Hsi says: "As the water is not outside the
earth, so soldiers are not outside the people. Therefore if a ruler is able to
nourish the people, he can get the multitudes for his armies."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Discipline directed by willpower and serious intent advances the
Work. Or: With experienced judgment and proper will and intent there will be a
good outcome.

The Superior Man trains and nourishes his powers to build an invincible unity.

The English word "infantry," meaning foot soldiers (the backbone of any
army), is derived from the French word enfant, meaning infant, or child. This
ancient association was made because a good military officer was expected to
treat his soldiers as if they were his own children -- with a stern but loving
discipline designed to improve their character. This concept is what the Image
alludes to when it says: “The superior man nourishes and educates the people,
and collects from among them a mighty army.” Psychologically interpreted the
idea is that the ego-complex is the general officer in the second line that
nourishes, educates and controls the other complexes within the psyche. This
can only be accomplished through discipline, and thus I have chosen that name
for the hexagram rather than the more usual title of The Army.

With the only dynamic line of the hexagram placed in the center of
the lower trigram we have an image of the position of the ego-complex in relation
to the rest of the psyche. The magnetic ruler in line five represents the Self,
isolated from direct physical involvement and dependent upon the dynamic ego
to carry out the Work in the material dimension. The seventh hexagram,
therefore, shows the Work from the ego's point of view.

Hexagram number eight, Holding Together, is the inverse of this
image, and shows the Work from the Self's point of view outside of spacetime.
There it is the dynamic fifth line ruler who is the focal point -- an image of the
Self surrounded by its satellites. In that dimension the second line ego-complex
is only another magnetic complex in the company of other magnetic complexes.
Ideally, the lower complexes within the psyche should be magnetic in relation to
a dynamic ego, but the ego is always magnetic in relation to the dynamic Self.
From the Self's point of view all of its complexes are its magnetic "children," or
"infantry." Hexagrams seven and eight should be studied together as reversed
images to get a full comprehension of each.

The images in the lines of Discipline all deal with the management of
forces as a coordinated whole -- as long as they are under the firm command of
the ego (who is only a general carrying out the orders of the Self), things proceed
7 -- Discipline -- 7

successfully. If the Discipline breaks down and the ego- general loses control,
defeat is certain.

Narutomi Hyogo said, "What is called winning is defeating one's allies.
Defeating one's allies is defeating oneself, and defeating oneself is
vigorously overcoming one's own body. It is as though a man were in the
midst of ten thousand allies but not one were following him. If one hasn't
previously mastered his mind and body, he will not defeat the enemy."
Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows the army going forth according to the
rules for such a movement. If these be not good, there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: An army must set forth in proper order. If the order is not
good, misfortune threatens.

Blofeld: An army is built up through discipline; without it, corruption leading
to disaster occurs.

Liu: An army should be put in correct order. If not, there will be disaster.

Ritsema/Karcher: Legions issuing-forth using ordinance. Obstructing virtue:
pitfall. [Ordinance, LU: Law, fixed regulation; regulate by law, divide into
right and wrong.]

Shaughnessy: Troops go out in ranks; it is not good; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The army is to go forth in an orderly manner: Otherwise, even good
turns out bad.

Cleary (2): ... Negating the good leads to misfortune.

Wu: The army going to war requires strict observance of discipline. When the
discipline is not enforced, there will be disaster.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If the rules aren't observed there will be evil. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Losing order is unfortunate. Blofeld: The disaster indicated in this
passage results from a breakdown of discipline. Ritsema/Karcher: Letting-go
ordinance: pitfall indeed. Cleary (2): If it loses order, there will be misfortune.
Wu: Lack of discipline means disaster.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

Legge: The rules are twofold: First, the war must be justified, and second, that
the manner of conducting it, especially at the outset, must be correct.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, a righteous cause, as well as a proper method for conducting
the war is essential for military success.

Wing: Before you take action, be certain that what you propose is worthwhile,
for otherwise you cannot sustain yourself. Be sure as well that you are organized.
Without order, your affairs will end in chaos and misfortune. Discipline is the key
here.

Editor: There is a certain ambiguity in this line, and an implicit warning to
maintain total awareness. It doesn't tell you that you are right or wrong -- it only
makes a general observation: a truism. The image portrays the necessity of a
correct hierarchy of forces (ideas, concepts) to attain any goal. (If you don't know
the proper sequence of numbers you cannot open a combination lock.) Crudely,
make sure you thoroughly understand your situation before taking action. The
implication is that you may not apprehend some crucial aspect of the matter at
hand, hence need more or better data. In some contexts, "ordinances" or "law"
may refer to the laws of nature. Compare with line 6.

The senses of the wise man obey his mind, his mind obeys his intellect, his
intellect obeys his ego, and his ego obeys the Self.
Katha Upanishad

A. Proper comprehension, organization and discipline is essential for
success. Bring order to your thoughts and feelings.

B. Take no action until you are absolutely confident that your strategy is
the correct one.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows the leader in the midst of the army.
There will be good fortune and no error. The king cherishes the myriad regions in
his heart.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In the midst of the army. Good fortune. No blame. The
king bestows a triple decoration.

Blofeld: The general in the midst of his army enjoys good fortune and is free
from error. Thrice he is honored by the King.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

Liu: A general works within his army. Good fortune, no blame. The king confers
a triple honor.

Ritsema/Karcher: Locating Legions, centering significant. Without fault.
The king three-times bestowing fate.

Shaughnessy: In the troops' midst; auspicious; there is no trouble; the king
thrice awards the command.

Cleary (1): At the center of the army, good fortune, no error; the king gives
orders thrice.

Cleary (2): Being in the middle of the army is lucky, blameless ... etc.

Wu: Being in the center of the army will be auspicious and blameless. The king
has thrice bestowed praises upon him.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He has received the favor of heaven. The king cherishes the
myriad regions in his heart. Wilhelm/Baynes: He receives grace from heaven.
He has the welfare of all countries at heart. Blofeld: It is because he is esteemed
by the King that he enjoys good fortune and the protection of his army. Solicitous
about the welfare of the empire, the King thrice awards him the command.
Ritsema/Karcher: Receiving heavenly favor indeed. Cherishing the myriad
fiefdoms indeed. Cleary (2): One receives celestial favor. Thinking of all the
provinces. Wu: Because he has the favor of the king. The king has in his heart the
welfare of all his people.

Legge: The orders of the king are the general's appointment to the command of
the army. "Thrice" does not mean that this appointment came three times, but
that it was given exclusively to the general with the king's entire confidence. The
favor of heaven means the same thing, and indicates that the ruler relies on the
general to promote the welfare of all the people in the "myriad regions" of the
kingdom.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The king's appointment of command is given to the general exclusively. The
latter must be in touch with his troops, sharing the good as well as the ill.

Wing: You are in an excellent position to communicate with others. Because
this situation is so well disposed you will meet with good fortune and win
recognition from your superiors.

Editor: This is a clear image of the ego taking its proper role in the integration of
the psyche -- bringing thoughts, passions and drives under the discipline of will.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

A Kabbalist might interpret the three honors bestowed by "the king" (the Self) as
authority conferred in the three lower realms of sensation, emotion and thought.

In large scale strategy the superior man will manage many subordinates
dexterously, bear himself correctly, govern the country and foster the
people, thus preserving the ruler's discipline.
Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. An image of responsible authority -- nourish and control your forces.

B. It is the ego's role to bring autonomous forces within the psyche under
the discipline of will.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows how the army may possibly have many
inefficient leaders. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.
Misfortune.

Blofeld: The army carries wagon-loads of corpses -- disaster!

Liu: The army carries corpses. Misfortune. [This is a time of sudden mourning.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Legions maybe carting corpses. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Of the troops some join with the corpses; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The army has casualties; bad luck.

Cleary (2): The army may have casualties; misfortune.

Wu: The army may have to cart back corpses. This will be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Possibly the army has idle leaders -- great will be its want of
success. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is quite without merit. Blofeld: This
indicates a serious defeat. Ritsema/Karcher: The great without achievement
indeed. Cleary (2): When the army has casualties, that is a great lack of success.
Wu: Despite its large number, it does not succeed.

Legge: Canon McClatchie translates this as: "Represents soldiers as it were
lying dead in their baggage carts, and is unlucky." Line two is the only
legitimate leader of the army. Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place, as if she
7 -- Discipline -- 7

had jumped over the leader and perched herself above him to take command. In
military operations there must be one ruling will and mind. A divided authority
is sure to bring failure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Defeat ensues when others interfere with the authority of the chosen ruler.
Divided command is often fatal.

Wing: There is an absence of vision and leadership. Whether it is a matter of
divergent goals or whether the acting leader is simply inept, the result is the
same: misfortune.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, this line describes one of the most
fundamental, yet least recognized truths of human consciousness -- the fact that
"unity" of awareness is mostly illusory. Indeed, the whole goal of the Work is to
actually attain this unity which we think we already possess. Legge's
metaphorical equation of "corpses" with "inefficient leaders" is not always apt --
in its most neutral interpretation, the line can depict a situation of (as Liu says)
"sudden mourning" or overwhelming grief.

Man has no individual I. But there are, instead, hundreds and
thousands of separate small I's, very often entirely unknown to one
another, never coming into contact, or, on the contrary, hostile to each
other, mutually exclusive and incompatible ... And each separate small I
is able to call itself by the name of the whole, to act in the name of the
whole, to agree or disagree, to give promises, to make decisions, with
which another I or the whole will have to deal.

    Gurdjieff

A. Are you in charge of your thoughts and feelings, or do they make your
choices for you?

B. Be on guard against inferior elements within yourself or the situation.

C. Suggests dead weight, useless baggage (beliefs, etc.)
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows the army in retreat. There is no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The army retreats. No blame.

Blofeld: The army retreats and halts -- no error!

Liu: The army retreats at the proper time. No blame.
7 -- Discipline -- 7

Ritsema/Karcher: Legions: the left resting. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The troops camp on the left; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): The army retreats and camps, there is no error.

Wu: The army halts its advance and chooses to camp. It will be blameless.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There has been no failure in the regular course. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It does not deviate from the usual way. Blofeld: No error is involved
because retreating and halting are a normal part of military activity. Ritsema/
Karcher: Not-yet letting-go the rules indeed. Cleary (2): One has not lost the
constant. Wu: It does not violate the normal course of action.

Legge: Line four is magnetic and not central. Therefore to retreat is natural to
her. Since the place is proper for a yielding line, the retreat is correct under the
circumstances. Retreat is no evidence of failure in a campaign. When advance
would lead to defeat, retreat is the regular course to pursue.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is confronted by a superior enemy. Orderly retreat to preserve the
army is his correct course of action.

Wing: The obstacles ahead are insurmountable. Struggling against them is
useless. Therefore the intelligent maneuver is retreat.

Editor: Regarded objectively, any withdrawal from an incorrect position can
only be a strategy for success.

But even when these forces within ourselves are temporarily stronger,
when the conscious personality is at first overwhelmed by their violence,
the vigilant self is never really conquered. It can retire to an inner
fortress and there prepare for and await the favorable moment in which
to counter-attack. It may lose some of the battles, but if it does not give
up its arms and surrender, the ultimate issue is not compromised, and it
will achieve victory in the end.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

A. Strategic withdrawal is not surrender.
7 -- Discipline -- 7
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows birds in the fields, which it will be
advantageous to seize and destroy. In that case there will be no error. If the
oldest son leads the host, and younger men idly occupy offices assigned to them,
however firm and correct he may be, there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is game in the field. It furthers one to catch it.
Without blame. Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses;
then perseverance brings misfortune.

Blofeld: Wild beasts roam the field. To avoid error, speech should be guarded.
The eldest son is in command; the younger son carts away the corpses.
Persistence would lead to calamity.

Liu: Much game in the field. It benefits to capture it. No blame. The army is led
by the eldest son. The younger son carries corpses. Continuing brings misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The fields possess wild-fowl. Harvesting: holding-on-to
words. Without fault. The long-living son conducting Legions. The junior son
carting corpses. Trial: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: In the fields there is game; beneficial to shackle prisoners; there
is no trouble. The eldest son leads the troops, the younger son carts corpses;
determination is inauspicious.

Cleary (1): There are animals in the fields. It is beneficial to take up words. A
mature person is to lead the army; if it is an immature person, there will be
casualties, for even if he is righteous the outlook is bad.

Cleary (2): ... A mature person leads the army. If the leader is immature, there
will be casualties, and even if the leader is right, the prospects are bad.

Wu: There are prisoners of war in the field. It will be advantageous to uphold the
mission of the military action. No blame. The eldest son commands the army. A
younger son carts back corpses. Even with perseverance, it will be foreboding.
[The fifth is a ruler’s position, but it is now occupied by a yin. Hence, the
occupant becomes a weak administrator. The elder man and the eldest son ...
refer to the same second nine, the commander.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The army's movements are directed by the oldest son in
accordance with his position in the center. The employment of younger men who
idly occupy their posts is improper. Wilhelm/Baynes: "Let the eldest lead the
army," because he is central and correct. "The younger transports corpses."
7 -- Discipline -- 7

Thus the right man is not put in charge. Blofeld: The moving line in the center
of the upper trigram indicates that the elder son is in command. The younger son
is put in charge of carrying away the corpses because he is unsuited to worthier
employment. [This line may refer to the suitability or otherwise of a person
required to fill an important post in any sort of organization or in carrying out
some scheme.] Ritsema/Karcher: Using centering movement indeed.
Commissioning not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): A mature person leads the
army, with balanced action. The immature sustain casualties because their
mission was not appropriate. Wu: His orders are given from the center. Because
the appointment is a poor choice.

Legge: In line five we have an intimation of the important truth that only
defensive war, or war waged by the rightful authority to put down rebellion and
lawlessness is right. The birds in the fields symbolize parties attacking for
plunder. The fifth line symbolizes the ruler, who is humble and magnetic, and in
the center. She cedes the use of all her power to the general in line two. Line two
is the "oldest son" and lines three and four are the younger brother and son -- i.e.,
the younger men who would cause evil if allowed to share the command. In
military operations there must be one ruling will and mind. A divided authority
is sure to be a failure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Invasion occurs. A seasoned soldier is chosen to lead the army to victory and
to prevent needless slaughter of the defeated people.

Wing: Rely on an experienced person to lead the way in correcting the situation.
He must be moderate in his behavior and not over reactive, for this would lead to
misfortune. Inexperienced and enthusiastic persons are now inappropriate for
the job of deliberate and controlled leadership.

Editor: This line contains ambiguities, yet the general image is clear enough. It
is a re-statement of lines two and three: a strong leader is essential for success.
Nevertheless, all except Legge's translation contain a final sentence stating that
perseverance leads to misfortune, which seems to contradict the earlier advice to
"pursue the game." As written, it is not clear whether this applies to the situation
in general or only in the case of incompetent leadership. If this is the only
changing line, the hexagram thus created is number twenty-nine, Danger --
suggesting that you carefully examine the situation at hand, consolidate your
control and advance cautiously.

Know you not that the thing is a warfare? One man’s duty is to mount
guard, another must go out to reconnoiter, a third to battle; all cannot be
in one place, nor would it even be expedient. But you, instead of
executing your Commander's orders, complain if aught harsher than
usual is enjoined; not understanding to what condition you are bringing
the army, so far as in you lies. If all were to follow your example, none

7 -- Discipline -- 7

would dig a trench, none would cast rampart around the camp, none
would keep watch, or expose himself to danger; but all turn out useless
for the service of war. Thus it is here also. Every life is a warfare, and
that long and various. You must fulfill a soldier's duty, and obey each
order at your commander's nod: aye, if it be possible, divine what he
would have done: for between that Commander and this, there is no
comparison, either in might or in excellence.
Epictetus

A. There is work to be done, but if you allow inferior elements to influence
your judgment, disaster will ensue.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the great ruler delivering his charges,
appointing some to be rulers of states, and others to undertake the headship of
clans. But inferior men should not be employed in such positions.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The great prince issues commands, founds states, vests
families with fiefs. Inferior people should not be employed.

Blofeld: The mandate is given to a great prince so that the work may go forward
satisfactorily. A man of mean ability would be useless, for he would merely
spread disorder through the realm.

Liu: The king issues directives, establishes states, and awards fiefs to certain
families. Inferiors should not be given power.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Great Chief possesses fate. Disclosing the city,
receiving a dwelling. Small People, no availing-of.

Shaughnessy: The great man's lord has a mandate, to open the state and
uphold the families; the little man should not use it.

Cleary (1): The great leader has orders, to establish states and families; do not
employ petty people.

Cleary (2): A great leader has orders to establish states and families that
continue. Small people are not to be employed.

Wu: The great king has given his order. This is the time to reconstruct the
nation and resettle families. Little men should not be appointed to office.
7 -- Discipline -- 7
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The ruler rightly apportions merit. Inferior men are sure to
throw the states into confusion. Wilhelm/Baynes: In order to reward merit
properly. Because they are certain to cause confusion in the country. Blofeld:
We cannot now rely on anyone of less than exceptional ability. Ritsema/
Karcher: Using correcting achieving indeed. Necessarily disarraying the
fiefdoms indeed. Cleary (2): Appropriate achievement. They will disrupt the
nation. Wu: Merits should be recognized. Because they will certainly cause
upheavals in the nation.

Legge: Other ways can be found to reward inferior men. They ought not to be
placed in situations where the conditions of others will depend on them.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Victory is achieved. The king rewards his supporters. But he is careful to
compensate inferior people with money instead of land or ruling privileges.
Otherwise power is abused by them.

Wing: Your aim is achieved. When settling into the new situation be certain to
align your proprieties to worthwhile values. Inferior persons and ideas should be
assigned to their proper places. Do not give them a voice in your affairs.

Editor: The imagery of this line is that of establishing a new order: a sorting out
and allocation of forces to their correct places. Proper allocation demands keen
discrimination. The meaning is similar to that of line 1, except that here one uses
the discriminating faculty after the action has been completed, whereas in line 1,
action has yet to commence. Lines 1 and 6 are like "bookends" holding the
hexagram together; reminding us that discipline is required both before and after
any meaningful change can be fixed in spacetime.

All the nations will be assembled before him and he will separate men one
from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats. He will place
the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left. Then the King will
say to those on his right hand, "Come, you whom my father has blessed,
take for your heritage the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation
of the world.”
-- Matthew 25: 32-35

A. Image of a judicious division of labor: a meritocracy.

B. "Accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative."

C. Allocate your energy intelligently: Evaluate your options so that your
choices are based on the best interests of the Work.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER EIGHT --
HOLDING TOGETHER

Other titles: The Symbol of Subaltern Assistance, Union, Unity, Grouping,
Alliance, Co-ordination, Leadership, Merging (as with tributaries of a river),
Seeking Union, Unification, Accord, Subservience, Individuation, Integration

Judgment

Legge: Holding Together indicates good fortune, but let the querent re-
examine himself by divination whether his virtue is great, un-intermitting and
firm. If so, there will be no error. Those who are ready will then join him, but
those who delay will meet with misfortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Holding Together brings good fortune. Inquire of the
oracle once again whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
then there is no blame. Those who are uncertain gradually join. Whoever comes
too late meets with misfortune.

Blofeld: Unity (or co-ordination). Good fortune! Further consultation of the
oracle will provide an omen of great and lasting value. No error! Those whose
hearts are troubled assemble. The laggards suffer disaster. [Just as the last
hexagram deals ostensibly with military affairs, so does this one largely
concern administration. For divination purposes, it should be regarded
figuratively -- unless a problem of administration is actually involved in the
enquiry.]

Liu: Union. Good fortune. The prediction for one attempting union should be
greatness, continuation, and constancy; no blame. If one hesitates, then joins
late: misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Grouping, significant. Retracing the oracle-consulting:
Spring, perpetual Trial. Without fault. Not soothing, on-all-sides coming.
Afterwards, husbanding: pitfall. [This hexagram describes your situation in
terms of how you categorize people and things and how you relate to these
categories. It emphasizes that joining people and things through recognizing
their essential qualities is the adequate way to handle it.]

Shaughnessy: Alliance: auspicious. The original milfoil divination: prime;
permanent determination is no trouble. The un-tranquil land comes; for the
latter fellow inauspicious.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Cleary (1): Accord is auspicious. Investigating and ascertaining, if the basis is
always right, there is no error: Then the uneasy will come; but the dilatory are
unfortunate.

Cleary (2): Accord bodes well. Make sure the basis is always right, so that
there will be no fault. Then the uneasy will come. Latecomers are unfortunate.

Wu: Subservience indicates auspiciousness. Seeking to confirm the intent and
motivation of allegiance by divination is without fault. Those who seek peace can
all come, but those who hesitate and come late will have ill fortune.

The Image

Legge: The image of the earth, and over it water, form Holding Together. The
ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and
maintained an affectionate relation to their princes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: On the earth is water: the image of Holding Together.
Thus the kings of antiquity bestowed the different states as fiefs and cultivated
friendly relations with the feudal lords.

Blofeld: The hexagram symbolizes water lying upon the land -- co-
ordination. [This is indicated by the nature of the component trigrams. It is
by co-operation between the fertile earth and the water which irrigates it that
growth is achieved.] The ancient rulers strengthened the realm by being on
affectionate terms with the feudal lords. [This may suggest dealing kindly with
immediate subordinates.]

Liu: Water over the earth symbolizes Union. The ancient kings established
many states and were friendly with the feudal lords.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above earth possessing stream. Grouping. The Earlier
Kings used installing myriad cities to connect the connoted feudatories.

Cleary (1): There is water on the earth, in accord. Thus did the kings of yore
establish myriad realms and associate with their representatives.

Wu: There is water on the ground; this is Subservience. Thus the late kings
founded the states and kept a personal relationship with all the princes.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Holding Together denotes help, and we see in the figure
inferiors docilely following their superior. All that is said in the Judgment follows
from the position of the dynamic line in the center of the upper trigram. Those
who do not respond to him have exhausted their good fortune.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Legge: The idea of union between the different members and classes of a state
and how it can be secured, is the subject of Holding Together. The dynamic
line in the fifth place of authority represents the ruler to whom the subjects of all
the other lines offer a ready submission. Generally, the second line is the proper
correlate of the fifth, but here all of the other lines are also his subjects.
Harmonious union is secured by the sovereign authority of the ruler, but he is
warned to see that his virtue is worthy of his position, and his subjects are
warned not to delay in submitting to him. Those who do not seek to promote and
enjoy union until it is too late are left out in the cold. The sentiment is the same
as that in the lines of Shakespeare about the tide in the affairs of men. In the
Image, "water upon the face of the earth" suggests an emblem of close union.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The success of the Work is determined by the proper integration of
intrapsychic forces. Separated and disparate forces are an index of its failure.
Unremitting willpower is the catalyst for unity. Do you have the requisite will to
facilitate this goal? Ask the oracle.

The Image: Archetypal intelligences (the gods) created many dimensions of
awareness (Jung's collective unconscious or objective psyche), maintaining
benevolent contact with them all. ("Benevolent" refers to original intent -- Plato's
realm of ideal forms -- "The Good." This is the image of an evolving multiverse of
awareness – a human psyche.)

Psychologically interpreted, Holding Together depicts the Self as the
fifth-line ruler surrounded by its satellite complexes. Astrologically rendered, we
see the same image in the solar system with its Sun surrounded by planets -- each
symbolizing a faculty within the psyche (e.g., Mercury is intellect, Mars is
aggression, etc). Viewed this way, the eighth hexagram portrays the functioning
of a divine process. (Whenever the "ancient kings" are mentioned in the I
Ching, we can take them as the symbolic architects of a primordial ideal of
perfection.)

The Image in Holding Together is an allegory of the Self establishing
the various complexes within the psyche (the Sun establishing its planets) so that
they can evolve into a reflection of the ideal intent of the Work. (In the timeless
realms of hyperspace, the Garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem exist
simultaneously, although here in spacetime, as key facilitators in a “work in
progress,” we labor somewhere between cause and effect.)

Although the psyche of a functional human being is held together
relatively coherently, its inner relationships are continuously orbiting each other
in cycles of change. (Astrological transits symbolize such changes.) The Tao of
psychic evolution (the Work) is to respond to the changes consciously and
coherently so that all forces eventually become synchronized with the will of their
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

source. The ego’s sole responsibility is to do this in the spacetime dimension for
the benefit of the Self.

In whatever way one may conceive the relationship between the
individual self and the universal Self, be they regarded as identical or
similar, distinct or united, it is most important to recognize clearly, and
to retain ever present in theory and practice, the difference that exists
between the Self in its essential nature -- that which has been called the
‘fount', the ‘center', the ‘deeper being', the ‘apex' of ourselves -- and the
small ordinary personality, the little ‘self' or ego, of which we are
normally conscious. The disregard of this vital distinction leads to absurd
and dangerous consequences.
Roberto Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

The message for the superior man in this hexagram is the only injunction
in the Book of Changes to re-consult the oracle. Implicit in this curious
challenge is a need to evaluate your competence to further the Work. The answer
should tell you the condition of your will.

The will is, curiously, not recognized as the central and fundamental
function of the ego. It has often been depreciated as being ineffective
against the various drives and the power of the imagination, or it has
been considered with suspicion as leading to self-assertion (will-to-
power). But the latter is only a perverted use of the will, while the
apparent futility of the will is due only to a faulty and unintelligent use.
The will is ineffective only when it attempts to act in opposition to the
imagination and to the other psychological functions, while its skillful
and consequently successful use consists in regulating and directing all
other functions toward a deliberately chosen and affirmed aim.
Roberto Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

The differences between hexagrams number seven and number eight are
the differences between a geocentric and a heliocentric frame of reference –
emphasizing the fact that the ego and the Self each perceive the psyche from an
entirely different point of view.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
my ways not your ways -- it is Yahweh who speaks.
Yes, the heavens are as high above earth
as my ways are above your ways,
my thoughts above your thoughts.
Isaiah 55: 6-9

8 -- Holding Together -- 8
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject seeking by her sincerity to win
the attachment of her object. There will be no error. Let the breast be full of
sincerity as an earthenware vessel is of its contents, and it will in the end bring
other advantages.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hold to him in truth and loyalty; this is without blame.
Truth, like a full earthen bowl: thus in the end good fortune comes from without.

Blofeld: Where there is confidence, the work of unification is carried on
faultlessly, for confidence is like a flowing bowl. There is a windfall yet to come.

Liu: Union with confidence. No blame. Full of confidence, like a bowl full of
water. Good fortune in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, Grouping it. Without fault.
Possessing conformity, overfilling the jar. Completing coming possesses more
significance. [Possessing conformity: "Inner and outer are in accord;
confidence of the spirits has been captured..."]

Shaughnessy: There is a return. Ally with him; there is no trouble. There is a
return; fill the earthenware; when winter comes perhaps it will be harmful;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): When there is truthfulness, accord is impeccable. When there is
truthfulness filling a plain vessel, ultimately there will come other blessings.

Cleary (2): When there is truthfulness, accord with it is blameless. When there
is truthfulness filling a plain vessel, when the end comes there is good fortune.

Wu: Having confidence in the person to whom support is given is without fault.
Confidence can grow to fill one’s heart like water gradually filling empty
earthenware. Eventually others may join to give their support. There will be good
fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: From seeking union there will be other advantages.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Encounters good fortune from another quarter. Blofeld:
Indicates unexpected good fortune. Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing more
significance indeed. Cleary (2): The first yin of accord has other good fortune.
Wu: There will be good fortune when others join to give support.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Legge: The earthenware vessel describes the plain, unadorned character of the
sincerity called for. The other advantages are all the benefits that result from
sincerity and union, which are themselves good.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is filled with sincerity in his associations with others.
He resembles an unadorned bowl which is full.

Wing: An honest, unaffected attitude is an excellent basis for forming
associations. With such an attitude you can be confident that others will be
attracted to you. Unexpected good luck is indicated here.

Editor: Note the idea of humble containment -- one collects the disparate
elements of the situation together in a plain clay bowl. Metaphorically, this
suggests that the simplest, most elementary approach to the problem is the
correct one. The line can refer to mental comprehension ("holding together"),
involving basic principles, unvarnished truth, etc.

Thus the individual psyche is an indefinite formation of unknown or
largely unknown constitution and extent. If it is to be consolidated --
individuated, to use the technical term -- it is necessary first of all to
determine its boundaries. Then all that belongs to the psyche must be
brought within these boundaries. Finally, a center must be established
that can control the functioning of the whole structure.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Sincere devotion to the Work brings eventual reward: "Modesty is the
best policy."

B. "Seek, and ye shall find."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the movement toward union and
attachment proceeding from the inward mind. With firm correctness there will
be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hold to him inwardly. Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Unification (or cooperation) should proceed from within our own
circle. Righteous persistence will bring good fortune.

Liu: Union from within. Continuing brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Grouping's origin inside. Trial: significant.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Shaughnessy: Ally with him from within; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Accord coming from within is correct and bodes well.

Cleary (2): Accord coming from within is auspicious if correct.

Wu: A desire to serve comes from within. With perseverance, there will be good
fortune.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She does not fail in what is proper. Wilhelm/Baynes: Do
not lose yourself. Blofeld: When unification or cooperation proceeds from
within our own circle, the results will not be disappointing. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Not originating letting-go indeed. Cleary (2): Accord coming from within means
not losing oneself. Wu: With self-discipline there will be no error.

Legge: Line two is the proper correlate of the ruler in line five. Her position in
the center of the lower trigram suggests the movement proceeding from the inner
mind.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man retains his individuality and dignity in his relationships with
others. He is not like the obsequious office seeker. His convictions are deeply
founded.

Wing: Trust your inner mind, maintain your integrity, and follow the demands
of your convictions. You will be sought after by others. If you chase after the
approval of others, you will lose your dignity.

Editor: Legge's commentary on the relationship between lines two and five
portrays the ego-Self relationship. The Self is the dynamic ruler dwelling in a
psychic dimension ("the inward mind"). The ego is always magnetic in relation to
the Self, and ideally the servant of the Work in spacetime. The inward mind is
thus the source of the voice of the Self. Because not every image or impulse in the
psyche originates from the Self, Wilhelm's translation of the Confucian
commentary ("Do not lose yourself"), warns us to be conscious enough to
maintain connection with our authentic inner voice -- not some complex
masquerading as such. (Often a tricky distinction.)

Man too, in his inner being, has a plane of contact with the divine self.
And that's why he can only find his own divine being within himself,
never by directing his attention towards the outside world.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

8 -- Holding Together -- 8

A. Unity proceeds from within -- listen to your inner voice. (The image can
sometimes suggest meditation.)

B. Integration of the psyche is an inner process – you must facilitate the
transformation by holding firmly to the principles of the Work.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject seeking for union with such as
ought not to be associated with.

Wilhelm/Baynes: You hold together with the wrong people.

Blofeld: He joins himself with evil-doers.

Liu: Union with the wrong people. There will be sad results.

Ritsema/Karcher: Grouping's in-no-way people.

Shaughnessy: Ally with him the non-human.

Cleary (1): Accord with the wrong people.

Cleary (2): The wrong person to accord with. [If one is not balanced correctly,
and one is in a position of minor authority but has no strong critical guidance,
one is “the wrong person to accord with.” In Buddhist terms, this means the
devil hasn’t a thought of good, and also that emotional opinions certainly do not
accord with the way to enlightenment.]

Wu: He associates himself with questionable characters.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Will not injury be the result? Wilhelm/Baynes: Is this
not injurious? Blofeld: If we do this, how can we fail to suffer for it? Ritsema/
Karcher: Reaching-to not truly injuring. Cleary (2): Will there not be injury?
Wu: How pitiable is this!

Legge: Line three is magnetic, not in the center, nor in her correct place.
The lines above and below her are also magnetic. These facts account for what is
said about her.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attempts to cultivate an intimacy with people beyond his proper
sphere. But this does not make him a person of greater stature.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Wing: The people in the environment of your inquiry are not right for you at
this time. Avoid too intimate an association with the group while maintaining an
outward sociability. Appearing committed to these people could darken your
reputation later on.

Anthony: We hold with wrong elements in ourself such as an incorrect idea, or
with emotions such as pride, anger or desire, which cause us to take hold of
issues and become involved in an evil process. Or, through carelessness, we
abandon the path to indulge in incorrect situations. Whenever we allow our
inferiors to take over direction of our lives, we lose the help of the Sage. Getting
this line either means that we are off the path, or that a situation will soon occur
wherein we revert to a pattern of incorrect action, thereby losing the path.

Editor: This is an unambiguous line. Applied to inner work, it can suggest that
you have mistaken the prompting of an autonomous complex for the Self. (See
Wilhelm's Confucian commentary on line two above.) In its most neutral
interpretation, it portrays a flawed connection: something doesn't match up
properly.

Every time we “identify” ourselves with a weakness, a fault, a fear or any
personal emotion or drive, we limit and paralyze ourselves. Every time
we admit “I am discouraged” or “I am irritated,” we become more and
more dominated by depression or anger. We have accepted those
limitations; we have ourselves put on our chains. If, instead, in the same
situation we say, “a wave of discouragement is trying to submerge me”
or “An impulse of anger is attempting to overpower me, the situation is
very different.
R. Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

A. Portrayal of an alliance with inferior forces.

B. You have a bad attitude, or are tempted by an inferior choice.

C. Seeking what should be left alone.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject seeking for union with the
one beyond herself. With firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Hold to him outwardly also. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: He co-operates with people beyond his immediate circle. Righteous
persistence will bring good fortune.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Liu: Union outside. Continuing brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Outside Grouping it. Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: From outside ally with him; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Accord with one outside is right and bodes well.

Cleary (2): According with the wise outside, correctness brings good results.

Wu: He gives his support to the exterior one. To be persevering will be
auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Union is sought with one beyond herself, and in this case
with a worthy object -- she is following the ruler above her. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
Hold outwardly also to people of worth, in order thus to follow the one above.
Blofeld: Cooperation with such people and leading them into virtuous ways
must be accomplished by working through their leaders. Ritsema/Karcher:
Using adhering-to the above indeed. Cleary (2): Accord with the wise outside is
the way to follow the advanced. Wu: “He gives support to the exterior one,” who
is a good man, because he follows the one above him.

Legge: "The one beyond herself" is the ruler or king who is the subject of line
five, and with whom union ought to be sought. The magnetic line, moreover, is in
a place proper to her, and if she is firm and correct, there will be good fortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The minister shows open loyalty to his king. This behavior contrasts to that
of a person without a post. The latter should remain reserved, so as to retain his
personal honor.

Wing: You are in close contact with the center of your community. This may
refer to the leader or ruler. Show your support openly, but do not forget who you
are or lose yourself in your allegiances.

Editor: Wilhelm suggests the idea of an outward display of allegiance. The
quality of your commitment to the Work is seen in your actions and way of life.
Sometimes the line suggests the idea of having confidence in yourself, or
confidence in your intuition. At its simplest level it can just mean: Make
connections beyond your "immediate circle." (Blofeld)

Regeneration is for nothing else than that the natural [ego] may be
subjugated, and the spiritual [Self] obtain dominion; and the natural is

8 -- Holding Together -- 8

subjugated when it is brought into correspondence. And when the
natural is brought into correspondence it no longer resists but acts as it
is commanded, and follows the behest of the spiritual -- scarcely
otherwise than as the acts of the body obey the dictates of the will.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

A. Live your beliefs. "Walk your talk."

B. Get in touch with what is beyond you. Seek a higher comprehension.

C. Get in touch with your basic motivations.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, affords the most illustrious instance of seeking
union and attachment. We see in it the king urging his pursuit of the game only
in three directions, and allowing the escape of all the animals before him, while
the people of his towns do not warn one another to prevent it. There will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Manifestation of Holding Together. In the hunt the king
uses beaters on three sides only and foregoes game that runs off in front. The
citizens need no warning. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Relying on his people's co-operation, the King pursues game which is
enclosed on three sides, but loses the quarry ahead. This is because the local
people were not warned. [This would seem to suggest that our loss is not due to
disloyalty but to having failed to take people into our confidence.] Righteous
persistence brings good fortune.

Liu: Union with honor. The king hunts on three sides only, losing game through
the front. The people are not afraid. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Manifest Grouping. The king avails-of three beaters.
Letting-go the preceding wildfowl. Capital people are not admonished.
Significant.

Shaughnessy: Lustrously ally. The king herewith thrice drives (the hunt) losing
the front catch; the city men are not warned; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Manifesting accord. The king uses three chasers and loses the game
ahead. The citizens are not admonished. Auspicious.

Cleary (2): Manifest accord ... The local people are not warned, etc.
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Wu: This [line] reveals the essence of allegiance. The king deploys a three-sided
chase in his hunt, such that he allows the game in front of him to escape. The
townspeople do not warn one another of the king’s doing. There will be
auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY
Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is because of the line's correct and central
place. The king takes only those animals who present themselves obediently. He
allows the others to escape. That the people do not warn one another to prevent
the animals to escape shows how the king, in his high eminence, has made them
pursue the due course. Wilhelm/Baynes: The position is correct and central.
Discarding those who resist, accepting the devoted: this is the meaning of
"foregoes game that runs off in front." "The citizens need no warning," for the
one above makes them central. Blofeld: This good fortune is indicated by the
central position of the ruling line. Leaving alone those difficult to catch and
following where the chances seem good, the King nevertheless loses the game in
front of him. This means that, although the local people were not warned, the
ruler adopts a fair and liberal policy. [The implication is that such a policy is
required for the success of our plans.] Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correctly
centered indeed. Stowing-away countering, grasping yielding. Letting-go the
preceding wildfowl indeed. Capital people not admonished. Commissioning
centering above indeed. Cleary (2): The local people are not warned, because
the ruler has effected balance. Wu: “To allow the game in front of him to escape”
means setting free those who want to leave and taking in those who want to
come, etc.

Legge: As the ruler, line five is the center of union. The ancient rule for hunting
expeditions was that after the beating was completed and the king was ready to
commence taking game, one side of the enclosure into which it had been driven
was left open and unguarded. This was proof of the royal benevolence which
didn't want to make an end of all the creatures inside. So well known and
understood was this benevolent principle, that all of his subjects cooperated in
carrying it out. The union shown here is therefore characterized by mutual
confidence and the appreciation of benevolent virtue.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The superior ruler accepts those who voluntarily come to him and lets
others go who care to go. He neither invites nor flatters. Union is based on
mutual confidence and appreciation.

Wing: You can trust fate at this time to bring you together with those who would
further you. There is a natural attraction at work here. The atmosphere is liberal,
and much can be accomplished. The time is auspicious, indeed.

Editor: This line is the subject of the Judgment and most of the commentary on
the Judgment. It depicts a shake-down or refining process. In terms of the
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

Work, because the ego has free will, it always has the option of "escape." The Self
allows it to choose, because free choice is essential to any permanent psychic
integration. A coerced synthesis could hardly be expected to hold together for
very long. Blofeld's translation and note seem to miss this idea.

A human being can choose to deny his individuality or truth, although,
sooner or later, he must inevitably choose, of his own free will, to remain
dormant or submit to the Way of Heaven.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- A Kabbalistic Universe

A. A sorting-out process -- some elements are gathered, and some
discarded. (Could be a test of your discrimination.)

B. Psychic forces re-position themselves in relation to their source.

C. The decision is yours whether or not to follow the demands of the Work.

D. Astute choice separates truth from error.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows one seeking union and attachment
without having taken the first step to such an end. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He finds no head for holding together. Misfortune.

Blofeld: Attempts to bring about unity when there is no one at the head result
in disaster. [This suggests a general lack of co-ordination due to poor
leadership.]

Liu: Union without a leader. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without a head, Grouping it. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The ally does not have a head: inauspicious.

Cleary (2): Accord without leadership bodes ill.

Wu: The association leads to nowhere. It will be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is no possibility of a good issue. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
Therefore he also fails to find the right end. Blofeld: No one at the head means
anyone to complete the work of administration. Ritsema/ Karcher: Without a
8 -- Holding Together -- 8

place to complete indeed. Cleary (2): Accord without leadership has no
conclusion. Wu: The association leads to nowhere, because it is a dead-end.

Legge: The magnetic sixth line is trying to promote union with the lines below
after the time for union has passed. It is too late -- she is symbolized as "without
a head," that is, as not having taken the first step, from which her action should
begin and go on to completion.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The situation bodes ill. No good ending can be expected in the absence of
the right beginning. It is too late.

Wing: The moment for Unity has passed. Right from the beginning something
was amiss and all attempts toward union inspired failure. Examine the situation
to determine the extent of your error.

Editor: This line echoes the last phrase of the Judgment: "With those who are
too late in coming it will be ill." That is: one who cannot hold together, by
definition cannot participate in unification. (Cf. Wu’s Confucian Commentary:
“The association leads to nowhere, because it is a dead-end.”)

He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not gather with
me scatters.
-- Luke 11: 23

A. Without disciplined organization, unification is impossible.

B. You've lost your connection.

Overcoming something small which is poisoning or nagging. Partially relieving

Judgment

Legge: Passive Restraint brings about progress and success. We see dense
clouds, but no rain coming from our western borders.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Taming Power of the Small has success. Dense
clouds, no rain from our western region.

Blofeld: The Lesser Nourisher. Success! Dense clouds giving forth no rain
approach from the western outskirts. [On the whole, this hexagram presages
good for us. The wind blowing across the heavens does not have the nourishing
virtues of rain, but it refreshes us and makes us feel better. Thus, if things are
going reasonably well with us, we may expect an improvement, especially in the
future when, presumably, the nourishing rain will fall. However, as lines three
and six indicate, if we are in serious trouble, we must not expect much help from
the rather mild good fortune that is blowing our way. The conception of
something weak or yielding bringing great benefit has been greatly developed
by the Taoists who, as though they were familiar with judo, recognize the
strength to be found in softness and the dangerous weakness sometimes
occasioned by too much strength. The name of this hexagram understood
somewhat differently may also be taken to mean that the time is propitious for
undertaking additional activity or the care of the young.]

Liu: Taming the Small Powers: success. Thick clouds come from the west.
No rain. [This situation symbolizes the preparation which precedes a new
development.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Small Accumulating, Growing. Shrouding clouds, not
raining. Originating-from my Western suburbs. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of a variety of seemingly unconnected events and impulses. It
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

emphasizes that retaining and hoarding these experiences through adapting to
them is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Small Harvest: Receipt; dense clouds do not rain from our
western pasture.

Cleary (1): Nurturance by the small is developmental. Dense clouds do not
rain, proceeding from one’s own western province.

Cleary (2): At small obstruction, nurturing the small succeeds... (etc.)

Wu: Restraint of the Small indicates pervasiveness. There are dense clouds,
but no rain coming from our western countryside.

The Image

Legge: The image of the sky with the wind moving above it forms Passive
Restraint. The superior man, in accordance with this, adorns the outward
manifestation of his virtue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wind drives across heaven: the image of The Taming
Power of the Small. Thus the superior man refines the outward aspect of his
nature.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing across the sky. The Superior
Man displays his scholarly accomplishments.

Liu: The wind blows across the sky, symbolizing Taming the Small Powers.
The superior man improves his ability and virtue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wind moving above heaven. Small Accumulating. A chun
tzu uses highlighting the pattern to actualize-tao. [Actualize-tao: ...ability to
follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with
acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Wind blowing up in the sky is small nurturance; thus do superior
people beautify cultured qualities.

Cleary (2): Wind moving up in the sky, nurturing the small. Thus do leaders
beautify cultured qualities.

Wu: The wind blows in the sky above; this is Restraint of the Small. Thus the
jun zi refines his splendorous virtue.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the ninth hexagram the magnetic line takes her proper
place, and all the lines above and below obey her -- hence the name Passive
Restraint. The figure is composed of the trigrams of Strength plus Flexibility.
Dynamic lines occupy the central places, and their will is accomplished -- this
means progress and success. Dense clouds but no rain depict the advancing
dynamic lines, but their source in the west shows that their beneficial influence
has yet to be felt.

Legge: The symbolism of the hexagram Passive Restraint is taken from the
magnetic line in the fourth place which holds all of the dynamic lines in restraint.
This is because the fourth place is properly passive (magnetic), and the response
of the other lines is therefore one of submission to her authority.

The second sentence of the Judgment indicates the time and place of King
Wen whose homeland was the western portion of China in the twelfth century
B.C. Rain coming and moistening the ground causes the luxuriant growth of the
natural world, and symbolizes the blessings which flow from good government.
Therefore from the west, the hereditary territory of the legendary author of the I
Ching, come the blessings which might enrich the whole kingdom. Here,
however, they are somehow restrained -- the dense clouds do not yet empty their
stores. Ch'eng-tzu, Wang Feng, and other scholars say, in effect: Dense clouds
should give rain. That they exist without doing so shows the restraining influence
of the hexagram at work. But the dynamic influence of the other lines still
continues, and the rain will eventually fall. The wind moves in the sky and then
ceases -- it can restrain for a time, but not indefinitely.

Cleary (1): Being strong, yet acting submissively, the submissiveness subdues
the strength, and strength cannot act on its own. The heart grows daily humbler,
while the virtue grows daily higher. One can thereby gradually get to the realm of
sages. This is why nurturance by the small is developmental.

Cleary (2): When you encounter situations that obstruct you and bog you down,
if you do not get resentful or bitter, but just nurture yourself to digest them, you
will be successful ... Indeed, events and situations that formerly obstructed you
can become means of self-development; this is how you succeed ...This line (Sic)
indicates the value of not grabbing for easy success and the value of long-term
results.

Wu: Restraint of the Small means literally small accumulation or small
restraint. “Small” is another name for yin. “Small accumulation” or “small
restraint” can also mean accumulation or restraint of the yin ... When there are
clouds, but no rain, it means that something has intervened and prevented the
cycle from completion ... The judgment simply means: Many factors can derail a
potential success and we should weigh them carefully before making a decision.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

Anthony: Our influence is limited by the circumstances... We should avoid
ambition to make progress as this exerts a negative pressure on people. It also
indicates that we do not yet trust our path of non-action or the power of truth to
change the situation...

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Power is accumulated by gently withholding its expression.

The Superior Man transforms his insights into components of his conscious
will. Or: He works on his outer, conscious (as opposed to inner, unconscious),
awareness. Or: He lives his beliefs.

Wilhelm's translation of the title of this hexagram is The Taming Power
of the Small. I have substituted Passive Restraint as a phrase more
compatible with contemporary English. The titles rendered by the other
translators, in my opinion, do not convey the meaning of the hexagram: Liu's
Taming the Small Powers even seems diametrically opposed to it, though it
is obvious that the title has multiple meanings. In describing the action of the
trigrams in this hexagram, Wilhelm conveys its essential meaning. (From
Lectures on the I Ching):

The function of wind is to tame creative forces, to accumulate these and
to make them visible. It is exceedingly difficult to understand this
relationship of forces, because the power used here is not expressed with
might, but it is the softest, gentlest, force imaginable. Wind is the least
visible of all phenomena, and this invisible wind is now needed to
concentrate that which strives upward, the strongest of all phenomena
... The unconscious acts and creates as it must, and we should submit to
the surgings of its waves. Only in the peripheral region, in the small free
zone of consciousness, can work be taken up each day, and whatever
needs refining can be refined. This is not superfluous work. Although this
small zone of consciousness and freedom is only a thin rind, its contact
with the forces of the unconscious is vigorous ... Hence, that which is
seemingly small and insignificant is, after all, the power that succeeds in
taming chaos by means of steady work and perseverance.

Lines one through four of the ninth hexagram show different forms of
restraint during a time of building tension. The dark clouds are accumulating,
and we know that eventually the rain will fall and the tension will be released.
Rain always symbolizes a union between Heaven and Earth in the I Ching,
which in turn means a synthesis of some sort. In the present instance, the
synthesis is still building, and although the tension seems to demand action we
are counseled to remain still. The magnetic force must hold the overwhelming
pressure of the dynamic forces in check.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

The fifth line depicts the focal point at which the forces are gathered, and
the sixth line shows the restraint necessary to allow the new transformation to
stabilize. If we turn the hexagram over we get Cautious Advance, which
depicts a different situation in which very careful action is called for. In the
present instance however, no action is correct action.

Through the activity of divine providence, an abundance of blessing
descends on the creatures, but this awakening of the power of providence
is dependent on the deeds of created beings, on "awakening from below."
Gershom Scholem – Kabbalah

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject returning and pursuing his own
course. What mistake should he fall into? There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Return to the way. How could there be blame in this? Good
fortune.

Blofeld: How could returning to this path be blameworthy?

Liu: Return to the correct way. Then how can one be blamed? It is good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Returning originating-from tao. Wherefore one’s fault?
Significant.

Shaughnessy: Returning from the way, what could its trouble be? Auspicious.

Cleary (1): Returning by the path – how could that be blameworthy? It bodes
well.

Wu: By returning to his own course, how can he be blamed? It will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He returns and pursues his own path -- it is right there
should be good fortune. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is something that bodes well.
Blofeld: This passage assures us of good fortune. Ritsema/Karcher: One's
righteousness significant indeed. Cleary (2): It is right that there should be good
fortune. Wu: “By returning to his own course” means good fortune.

Legge: Line one is the first line of the trigram of Strength, here occupying its
proper place. Therefore, notwithstanding the check of line four, he resumes his
movement and will go forward according to his strong nature.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man presses forward. When obstacles are encountered,
however, he returns to the state of greater choice. By not forcing his way, he
eventually gains his objective.

Wing: In forcing your way, you meet with obstacles. It is best to hold back to a
position where you have the choice of advance or retreat. Then you may concern
yourself with the true nature of the situation and react accordingly.

Anthony: In taking hold of the problem, we adopt an either-or attitude, to force
some sort of conclusion. This impatience springs from desire and our ego’s
attempt to dominate the situation. This is doomed to failure. It is best to return to
the path of acceptance and modesty.

Cleary (1): Being strong yet remaining humble, concealing one’s light and
nurturing it in obscurity, embracing the Tao and keeping settled, not injuring
inner reality by outward artificiality, is to be able to return by way of the path.
Being able to return by way of the path, though the nurturance is small, one can
gain its nourishment, and strong energy grows day by day; not only is it
blameless, it brings good fortune. This is the nurturance of being great yet being
humble and appearing small.

Cleary (2): In the first yang, accurate knowledge is strong, so obstacles caused
by events cannot do any harm, and so one “returns by the path.”

Editor: Legge's commentary here is inconsistent with his own translation of the
line. The strong first line wants to forge ahead, but the idea of the figure is passive
restraint, and the symbol of that restraint is his correlate fourth line. He accepts
her message and returns to virtue by restraining his forward impetus. Wilhelm's
translation expresses this idea as a command to "Return to the way” -- i.e.: "Get
back where you belong.” Ritsema/Karcher's rendering of "Returning originating-
from tao” is perhaps the most powerful image. This line is sometimes received
when doubts arise about the Work or our way of processing it: it is telling us to
trust our inner knowing. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram
becomes #57, Penetration, with the corresponding advice: “In advancing and
retreating, the perseverance of a warrior furthers.”

A knowledge of the opinions of others may guide us in our researches as
long as we cannot find the truth in ourselves, but such knowledge is as
liable to mislead us as to lead us right; the only way to arrive at the
recognition and understanding of the truth is the development of the
knowledge of self.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

A. Don't get ahead of yourself. Restrain your compulsive need to act.
Don't exceed your authority.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

B. Image of a return to normalcy.

C. Remain persevering in your conduct of the Work. You know exactly
what that is.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject, by the attraction of the
former line, returning to the proper course. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He allows himself to be drawn into returning. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Compelling ourselves to go back brings good fortune.

Liu: One is influenced to return to the correct way. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Hauling-along, returning. Significant.

Shaughnessy: A firm return; auspicious.

Cleary (2): Leading back bodes well.

Wu: Returning to his own course through association will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: By the attraction of the first line he returns to his own
course and is in the central place: neither will he err in what is due from him.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Being drawn into returning derives from the central
position. Also, he does not lose himself. Blofeld: The idea of not getting lost is
also implied. Ritsema/Karcher: Truly not originating-from letting-go indeed.
Cleary (2): Leading back into the center and not losing oneself. Wu: The
association is central. His position is not compromised.

Legge: The second place is dynamic, and though a magnetic place is not
appropriate to him, that place is central. Because of this he restrains himself,
does not exceed his authority, and makes common cause with line one.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not expose himself needlessly to rebuff by pushing forward
when the time is not propitious. He retreats with kindred souls.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

Wing: Although you might like to take action, it would be wise to re-evaluate the
situation and study the examples of others who have come before you. The time
suggests that a retreat leads to good fortune.

Editor: Both lines one and two have a strong urge to advance, but they impose
virtuous restraint on this urge and return to their proper places. Sometimes the
line can imply not throwing oneself away on an ill-timed venture.

By this method the discerning Kabbalist can decide that it is not wise to
move against the tide, but wait for the flow to turn and place an impulse
in the ebb that will bear fruit when the active phase begins again.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- The Work of the Kabbalist

A. An image of voluntary restraint and a return to harmony (balance).

B. Preserve your integrity by voluntarily retreating from contention.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, suggests the idea of a carriage, the strap beneath
which has been removed, or of a husband and wife looking on each other with
averted eyes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The spokes burst out of the wagon wheels. Man and wife roll
their eyes.

Blofeld: The chariot is separated from the spoked wheel. Husband and wife
stand glaring at each other.

Liu: The wheels separate from the wagon. Husband and wife are in disharmony.

Ritsema/Karcher: Carting stimulating the spokes. Husband, consort,
reversing eyes.

Shaughnessy: The cart throws its axle-strut; the husband and consort cross
eyes.

Cleary (2): The wheels are detached from the cart. Husband and wife look away
from each other.

Wu: The wooden pieces holding the axle firmly underneath a carriage come off.
The husband and wife look at each other with averted eyes.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Line three is like a husband who cannot maintain correctly
his relations with his wife. Wilhelm/Baynes: When "man and wife roll their
eyes," it is a sign that they cannot keep their house in order. Blofeld: Disorder
reigns within the house. Ritsema/Karcher: Not able to correct the home
indeed. Cleary (2): They cannot cohabit. Wu: They cannot maintain proper
relations.

Legge: Line three, though dynamic and in its proper place, is not in the center
and therefore is less able to resist the restraint of the fourth line.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The circumstances favor the weak. Progress is frustrated by external,
apparently minor, impediments. The net effectiveness is that of a wheel without
spokes.

Wing: The opposition appears minor and advance seems possible. Yet the
situation is not in your control. If you insist upon forging ahead confidently you
will be defeated by no end of annoyances. This has a most undignified
appearance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the
consciousness that the obstructing power is slight... External conditions hinder
the advance... We do not yet heed this hint from fate, hence there are annoying
arguments like those of a married couple...

Anthony: This symbolizes a thing falling apart, losing its shape, integrity and
usefulness. The situation falls apart when we bring controversial matters up,
rather than allowing them to arise spontaneously. We rush things when we are
afraid that the right time may not occur soon enough. Under the influence of fear
we are unable to attain the objectivity we need to find the right solution.
“Power lies with the weak.” True power, in dealing with the obstinate
power of the ego, or with Fate itself, is in letting go, not taking hold in trying to
make points, or engaging in arguments, or striving to overcome the situation. It
also lies in reticence, tranquility and detachment.

Cleary-2: In the third yang, one relies on unfertile intellect and so is stymied by
obstacles that arise in the course of events: concentration and insight are both
damaged.

Editor: Progress is halted due to a polarization of thoughts and feelings:
emotion refuses to conform to reason. Psychologically: when our emotions don’t
match our rationalizations, progress is impeded. This line often portrays a
situation in which logic and affect clash with fated circumstances: emotion rules
when reason fails to resolve a seemingly simple dilemma. If this is the only
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

changing line, hexagram #61, Inner Truth, is evoked, with a corresponding line
portraying the effects of inconstancy and lack of will.

If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
Mark 3:25

A. Inner turmoil creates disunion and halts advancement.

B. Thoughts and feelings are out of synch with what is happening.

C. An image of impotent frustration which blocks the Work.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject possessed of sincerity. The
danger of bloodshed is thereby averted, and her ground for apprehension
dismissed. There will be no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way. No
blame.

Blofeld: Owing to confidence, bloody and terrible deeds are avoided -- no error.

Liu: If you are forthright, bloodshed and fear vanish; no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity. Blood departing, awe issuing-forth.
Without fault. [Possessing conformity: "Inner and outer are in accord;
confidence of the spirits has been captured..."]

Shaughnessy: There is a return; blood departs, warily exiting; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (2): If there is truthfulness, blood goes and fear leaves, and there is no
fault.

Wu: There is self-confidence. Blood vanishes and vigilance diminishes. There
will be no blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The subjects of the lines above agree in aim with her.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The one at the top agrees in attitude. Blofeld: The will of
our superiors is identical with our own. Ritsema/Karcher: Uniting purposes
above indeed. Cleary (2): There is a consonance of will with on high. Wu: He
shares a common goal with the person above.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

Legge: Line four, the lone magnetic line surrounded by dynamic lines, might
well expect wounds and feel apprehension in trying to restrain the others. But
she is in her proper place and is the first line of the trigram of Docile Flexibility.
She is said to have sincerity, and the dynamic lines are moved to sympathy and
help, and there is no mistake.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man follows the path of righteous flexibility, thereby eliminating
anxieties and averting the dangers of bloodshed. He is always mindful of the
question: what if you are wrong?

Wing: If you are honest and sincere and influence others with the correct advice,
you can avoid existing and terrible dangers. Fear and anxiety will give way only to
truth. Then no error will be made.

Editor: Line four gives the symbolism of the hexagram its meaning. It is the
passive strength of non-action properly holding all dynamic impetus in check.

As the individual takes up the situations and experiences of his life, step
by step, from the very beginning, and brings before the bar of his adult
consciousness the acts of his ignorant and unconscious former self, he
finds himself obliged to take responsibility for certain acts, performed in
ignorance, for which at the time he could not take responsibility... As (he)
follows through this process of taking responsibility for his former
unconsciousness, the actions that were at that earlier time outside of his
control, completely autonomous, lost to the personality, are joined to
consciousness. Something of himself that has been in possession of the
dragon is redeemed, and that amount of the dragon's energy is captured
for the individual's own use.
M. E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. The courage of your convictions will help you overcome a difficult
situation. Sincere devotion to the Work resolves all problems, weathers all
storms.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject possessed of sincerity, and
drawing others to unite with him. Rich in resources, he employs his
neighbors in the same cause with himself.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If you are sincere and loyally attached, you are rich in your
neighbor.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

Blofeld: Confidence is like a cord to bind the hearts of others. With it we enrich
our neighbors.

Liu: If you are sincere you will be enriched by your neighbor.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, binding thus. Affluence: using one's
neighbor. [Possessing conformity: "Inner and outer are in accord; confidence of
the spirits has been captured..."]

Shaughnessy: Losing sheep at Yi; there is no regret.

Cleary (1): There is truthfulness in companionship; prosperity is shared with
the neighbor.

Wu: Association strengthens self-confidence. With wealth, he is capable of
reaching out to help his neighbors.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His sincerity draws others to unite with him -- he does not
use only his own rich resources. Wilhelm/Baynes: You will not be alone in
your riches. Blofeld: This implies not getting rich on our own. Ritsema/
Karcher: Not solitary affluence indeed. Cleary (2): One does not enjoy
blessings alone. Wu: He does not keep wealth for himself.

Legge: Line five occupies the central place and because of his sincerity converts
lines four and six into helpful neighbors who offer their energy and resources to
accomplish a common purpose.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Partners reinforce each other through loyalty. The man uses both his own
resources and those of his neighbors to further their common cause.

Wing: Through a co-operative and loyal relationship with another, you increase
your resources mutually. In this way you can accomplish your aim.

Editor: Psychologically, this images an inner unity -- a gathering of energy to
address a worthy task. The key elements are the ego's devotion and ability to
muster its forces.

The term individuation means a becoming whole and therefore implies
the necessity of reconciling the conscious and the unconscious parts of the
psyche. In practice the process involves two steps. The first is that of
searching out and recognizing all the scattered parts of the psyche and
bringing them together; the second is that of amalgamating and

9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

coordinating them, together with the energies that inhere in them, so
that they will make a meaningful whole -- a cosmos, not a chaos.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Pull yourself together and get to work.

B. Sincerity inspires cooperation.

C. A cooperative alliance.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows how the rain has fallen, and the onward
progress is stayed; so must we value the full accumulation of the virtue of humble
service. But a wife exercising restraint, however firm and correct she may be, is
in the position of peril, and like the moon approaching to the full. If the superior
man prosecutes his measures in such circumstances, there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The rain comes, there is rest. This is due to the lasting effect
of character. Perseverance brings the woman into danger. The moon is nearly
full. If the superior man persists, misfortune comes.

Blofeld: The rains are falling and a time of rest has come. Virtue continues to
increase. At this moment, persistence would bring serious trouble to women.
Were the Superior Man to venture forth at the time of the full moon, he would be
courting calamity.

Liu: It is raining; one can rest, respected for one's virtues. Continuing to hesitate
like a woman brings danger; the moon is almost full. If the superior man sets
forth, misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Already rain, already abiding. Honoring actualizing-tao
carrying. The wife, Trial: adversity. The moon almost facing. A chun tzu
chastising: pitfall. [Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the course traced by the
ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which
makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Shaughnessy: Having rained and having stopped, he still gets to ride; for a
maiden to determine is auspicious; the moon is almost full; for the gentleman to
be upright is inauspicious.

Cleary(1): It has rained and settled. Esteeming virtue, putting the wife on
top, though she be chaste there is danger. The moon is almost full; it bodes ill for
the superior person to go on an expedition.
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

Wu: The rain has come and it has brought comfort to people. Those who are
virtuous deserve it. The woman is in a difficult situation despite her proper
conduct. The moon is almost full. It will be foreboding for the jun zi to be
venturesome.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The power of Passive Restraint has accumulated to the
full. If the superior man prosecutes his measures, he will find himself obstructed.
Wilhelm/Baynes: "The rain comes, there is rest." This is the continuously
cumulative effect of character. “If the superior man persists, misfortune comes,”
for there might be doubts. Blofeld: The first sentence indicates that our stock of
virtues is mounting; that about the Superior Man indicates that we may expect
trouble. Ritsema/Karcher: Actualizing-tao amassing carrying indeed.
Possessing a place to doubt indeed. Cleary (2): It having rained and settled
represents full development of inner qualities. It is unlucky for a leader to go on
an expedition, as there is some doubt. Wu: Only those who have accumulated
virtues deserve good fortune. His action raises doubts about his judgment.

Legge: In line six the idea of the hexagram has run its course. The harmony of
nature is restored. The rain falls, and the onward march of the dynamic lines
should now stop. But passive restraint that has achieved such a result, if it plume
itself on it, will be in the perilous position of the full moon which can now only
wane. Let the superior man, when he has attained his end, remain in quiet.
Restraint is at its height and the restrained should keep still for a time. The
paragraph is metrical, and we have a couplet:

Lo! Rain, lo! Rest, the power is full!
Good man! Hold hard. Obstructions rule!

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Bit by bit the man achieves success. This should be valued but not pushed
too far. When the moon is full, waning is inevitable. Quiescence is in order.

Wing: You have won the battle. Rest and consolidate your position now and
restrain yourself from going after the entire war. Caution: Adversity is on the rise.
If you attempt to push ahead, you will meet with misfortune.

Editor: Rain symbolizes the union of Heaven and Earth, and the issue from such
union is always a new synthesis of forces. The Judgment describes dense clouds,
but no rain -- an image of tension and its impending resolution. Here that
resolution has taken place -- it is now time to rest and allow the synthesis to
stabilize. The image of the wife in peril during a waxing moon suggests that
continuing to push forward could result in an uncontrollable emotional release.
Rest and relaxation are called for to reduce tension. If this is the only changing
line, the new hexagram become number 5, Waiting, reinforcing the idea that
9 -- Passive Restraint -- 9

inaction is the proper response now. Sometimes one gets this line when
anxiously importuning the oracle: it is telling you to relax and cease striving.
Ritsema/Karcher render "Actualize-tao”: Ability to follow the course traced
by the ongoing process of the cosmos ... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that
which makes a being become what it is meant to be. And "Adversity,” (LI) as:
Danger, threatening, malevolent demon ... It indicates a spirit or ghost that
seeks revenge by inflicting suffering upon the living. Pacifying or exorcizing
such a spirit can have a healing effect.” I have always found these definitions
extremely useful in interpreting any line in which they appear.

Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. For six days you shall labor
and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath for Yahweh your
God. You shall do no work that day, neither you nor your son nor your
daughter nor your servants, men or women, nor your animals nor the
stranger who lives with you. For in six days Yahweh made the heavens
and the earth and the sea and all that these hold, but on the seventh day
he rested; that is why Yahweh has blessed the Sabbath day and made it
sacred.
Exodus 20: 8-11

A. Suggests the completion of a cycle -- rest is now required to allow a
reorganization of forces for a new phase of the Work. Relax, let go -- leave the
Work alone for a while.

B. Drop the subject of inquiry.

C. Allow the situation to develop.

10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TEN --
CAUTIOUS ADVANCE

Other titles: Treading, Conduct, The Symbol of Stepping Carefully, Proper
Conduct, Cautious Treading, Proceeding Cautiously, Watch Your Step, Proceed at
Your Own Risk, Advancing With Care "Illustrates the difference between courage
and foolhardiness." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Cautious Advance suggests the idea of one treading on the tail of a
tiger, which does not bite him. There will be progress and success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Treading. Treading upon the tail of the tiger. It does not
bite the man. Success. [For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not
dangerous here, because it happens in good humor and without presumption,
so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part. Such
simplicity and unpretentiousness is faith derived from reality -- neither from
love of happiness nor fear of unhappiness, but free of fear and hope. The
concern here is with the art of action by means of proper conduct, and
presupposes being childlike in its highest sense.]

Blofeld: Though he treads upon the tiger's tail, it does not bite him. Success!
[The general idea of this hexagram is that success can be won, but that the
situation is dangerous enough to require extreme caution. The `tiger' MAY not
bite, but on the other hand, as lines three and five demonstrate, we cannot be
certain of this. To consort with rulers and people in high places may be most
beneficial; but, should we fail to please, they may make us regret our temerity.]

Liu: Treading: Stepping on the tail of a tiger, but it does not bite one. Success.
[You should act only after you have planned carefully, and then with
resolution.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Treading a tiger tail. Not snapping-at people. Growing.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of finding and making your
way. It emphasizes that doing this step by step is the adequate way to handle it.]

Shaughnessy: Treading on a tiger's tail; not a real man; receipt.

Cleary (1): Even when they tread on a tiger’s tail, it doesn’t bite people. This is
developmental.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Cleary (2): Someone treads on a tiger’s tail without being bitten, thus getting
through.

Wu: Treading after a tiger without being bitten indicates pervasion.

The Image

Legge: The image of the sky above, and below it the waters of a marsh, form
Cautious Advance. The superior man, in accordance with this, discriminates
between high and low, and gives settlement to the aims of the people.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven above, the lake below: the image of Treading.
Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low, and thereby fortifies
the thinking of the people. (Thus the superior man creates in society the
differences in rank that correspond with differences in natural endowment, and
in this way fortifies the thinking of the people, who are reassured when these
differences accord with nature ... We see a universe moved from within,
without external manipulation. Since the universe is also within the human
being, internal universal order leads to order without by the force of necessary
differentiation.) [Cf. the ideal society in Plato’s Republic.]

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a body of water lying open to the sky. The
Superior Man consults both high and low and thereby steadies the people's will.

Liu: The heaven above and the lake below symbolize Treading. The superior
man differentiates between high and low, and thus fixes the minds of the people.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven above, marsh below. Treading. A chun tzu uses
differentiating Above and Below. A chun tzu uses setting-right the commoners,
the purpose.

Cleary (1): Above is the sky, below is a lake: Treading. Thus do superior
people distinguish above and below, and settle the will of the people.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders stabilize the wills of the people by distinguishing
positions.

Wu: Heaven above and marshes below, this is Treading. Thus the jun zi
discriminates various levels of governmental services and sets the goals of the
people.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Cautious Advance we have the symbol of Weakness
treading on that of Strength. The lower trigram indicates Pleasure and
Satisfaction, and responds to the upper indicating Strength. Hence it is said, "He
treads on the tail of a tiger." The fifth line is dynamic, in the center, and in his
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

correct place. He occupies the God-given position, and falls into no distress or
failure -- his action will be brilliant.

Legge: Cautious Advance is made up of the lower trigram of Pleased
Satisfaction or "Naiveté," and the upper trigram of Heaven, or Primal Power.
Being situated below the great symbol of Strength, Naiveté is seen to be stepping
on a tiger's tail. To emerge unscathed from such a danger depends entirely upon
propriety and a strict observance of all the rules of correct behavior. On these, as
so many stepping stones, one may tread safely amid scenes of disorder and peril.

The symbol of weakness, according to Wang Shen-tzu is the third line
which is urged on by the two lines below it to encounter the three strong lines
above. Other commentators say that the whole lower trigram, partaking of the yin
nature, is the symbol of weakness, and the entire upper trigram is symbolic of
strength. The Chen-Chung editors say that to get the full meaning, we must hold
both views.

Ch'eng-tzu says of the Image: "The sky above and a marsh lying
below it is true in nature and reason, and so should be the rules of propriety
on which men tread."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: A cautious advance in the face of potentially volatile conditions will
lead to safety.

The Superior Man orders his priorities realistically and gets a grip on himself.

Cautious Advance depicts the lower trigram of the joyful Youngest
Daughter stepping on the heels of the upper trigram of Heaven -- the stern Pater
Familias: Yahweh Saboath, or Zeus with his thunderbolt. In her innocence she
doesn't realize the danger of her action. This is "treading on the tail of the tiger,"
and the hexagram teaches us how to do this without being bitten. The original
Judgment suggests that superior powers realize the innocent intent of the action,
and may be inclined to be lenient.

You should not resist fate,
nor need you escape it;
if you go to meet it,
it will guide you pleasantly.
Goethe

Wilhelm's notes on The Image illustrate the undemocratic truth that
although all men are created equal in the eyes of God, every human being
possesses clearly differentiated strengths, weaknesses, talents and incapacities.
In Lectures on the I Ching, he says:
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

The secret of proper conduct is in inequality. Uniformity alone cannot
give rise to proper conduct. To be sure, uniformity might produce rule
and regulation or law and force. But tedious force and brutal law never
led people to convictions that legitimately resulted in proper conduct (the
term includes that which produces proper conduct and proper conduct
achieved). Instead, as Confucius said: "Force produces only alienation
and people transgress secretly that which is public regulation."

Cautious Advance often images a test situation, or it can be a warning
that you are walking on the edge of a precipice. The image of The Fool in the tarot
deck has similar associations. Without changing lines, this hexagram implies a
need for extreme caution, or that your actions are tempting fate.

The passions, instead of having to be painfully exterminated, are yoked
like snarling tigers to the adept’s carriage. The dangers of such a course
are obvious. As one of my Lama teachers put it: "While you were
traveling in that cart, a tumble would have done you little harm. Now I
have given you an airplane. Don't crash in flames!"
J. Blofeld -- The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject treading his accustomed path. If
he go forward, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Simple conduct. Progress without blame.

Blofeld: Simple in his conduct, he goes forth -- no error!

Liu: Simplicity of conduct. Continue. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sheer Treading going. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Counter treading; in going there is no trouble.

Cleary(1): Treading plainly, going without fault.

Cleary(2): Plain treading; to go is blameless.

Wu: Treading ahead in a blind manner will be blameless.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Singly and exclusively he carries out his long cherished
wishes. Wilhelm/Baynes: The progress of simple conduct follows in solitude
its own bent. Blofeld: Conducting ourselves with simplicity while advancing
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

suggests the ability to realize our desires without aid from others. Ritsema/
Karcher: Solitarily moving desire indeed. Cleary (2): To go treading plainly
means to carry out your vows alone. Wu: He is willing to go alone.

Legge: Line one is a dynamic line in a dynamic place, giving us the idea of
activity, firmness and correctness. One so characterized will act rightly.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is in a subordinate position without social obligation.
Progress will be attained without blame if he remains content with his simple
accustomed path, making no demands upon others.

Wing: Use your most basic values of Conduct in advancing toward your aim.
Do not try to use others beyond maintaining friendly relations. Do not become
obligated to others in your endeavors. Your position is low. Simplicity in your
behavior will prevent mistakes and allow you to progress.

Editor: Wilhelm's rendition of the Confucian commentary uses the word
"solitude," and Blofeld emphasizes the idea of progress "without aid from
others." The idea is that of walking one's path alone, heedless of the external
opinions of others or of the autonomous clamor of our own inner complexes. It
can sometimes take the meaning of: "Mind your own business."

Let your eyes be fixed ahead,
your gaze be straight before you.
Let the path you tread be level
and all your ways made firm.
Turn neither to right nor to left,
keep your feet clear of evil.
Proverbs 4:25

A. Stay on your accustomed path.

B. The situation is tricky, but if you proceed with business as usual, you
can avoid trouble.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject treading a path that is level
and easy -- a quiet and solitary man, to whom, if he be firm and correct, there will
be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Treading a smooth, level course. The perseverance of a dark
man brings good fortune.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Blofeld: The recluse treads his path peacefully. Righteous persistence will bring
good fortune.

Liu: Treading in a safe and peaceful way. The man in seclusion carries on. Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Treading tao, smoothing, smoothing. Shade people, Trial:
significant.

Shaughnessy: Treading the road so sincerely; the dark man's determination is
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Treading the path evenly, the aloof person is upright and fortunate.

Cleary (2): Treading the road; it is level. The person in obscurity is fortunate if
upright.

Wu: The trodden road is open and broad. A person in seclusion with
perseverance will have good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Holding the due mean, he will not allow himself to be
thrown into disorder. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is central and does not get
confused. Blofeld: The recluse is a fortunate man because he cleaves to the
middle path and does not allow himself to be confused. Ritsema/Karcher:
Centering, not originating-from disarray indeed. Cleary (2): In the sense of not
becoming personally deranged within. Wu: His mind is not disturbed from
within.

Legge: Line two occupies the middle of the trigram, which symbolizes a path cut
straight and level along a hillside or over difficult terrain. Since the fifth line is
not his proper correlate, he is portrayed as a quiet and solitary man.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The quiet and solitary man apprehends the inscrutable. He seeks nothing,
holds to the mean, and remains free from entanglements.

Wing: Maintain an ambiance of modesty and moderation. Do not harbor
expectations or demands. Do not get involved with the dreams of others or hold
overly ambitious goals. In this way you will meet with good fortune.

Editor: There seems to be little essential difference between lines one and two,
except that the second line's central position emphasizes the idea of moderation
and balance. When two lines in a hexagram have nearly identical meanings it is
often helpful to check the corresponding hexagrams and lines created if each
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

were the only changing line -- these will often provide clues as to their
differences. In this instance, line one suggests avoiding trouble by minding one's
own business; line two avoids trouble by a certain innocent faith in his destined
path: a recluse or hermit who ignores the preoccupations of the crowd.
Ritsema/Karcher translate "shade" (Wilhelm/Shaughnessy: "dark"), as: "hidden
from view, retired, solitary, secret; dark, obscure, occult, mysterious;
ignorant."

If I were possessed of Austere Knowledge
Walking on the Main Path [of Tao],
I would avoid the by-paths.
The Main Path is easy to walk on,
Yet people love the small by-paths.
Lao-Tzu

A. Stay out of sight, keep a low profile, stick to your own affairs, ignore the
crowd -- balanced perception prevents confusion.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows a one-eyed man who thinks he can see; a
lame man who thinks he can walk well; one who treads on the tail of the tiger and
is bitten. All this indicates ill fortune. We have a mere bravo acting the part of a
great ruler.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A one-eyed man is able to see, a lame man is able to tread.
He treads on the tail of the tiger. The tiger bites the man. Misfortune. Thus does a
warrior act on behalf of his great prince.

Blofeld: Though a man have but one eye he can still see; though he be lame, he
can still walk; but he who treads upon the tiger's tail will get bitten -- disaster!
[Here the significance of the line runs counter to the benign significance of the
hexagram; in all such cases, it is the line which provides the main indication of
what is going to happen with regard to the matter forming the subject of the
enquiry.] The warrior undertakes things for his lord. [This is no time to stand up
to our superiors (tread on the tiger’s tail); it is a time for obedience.]

Liu: A one-eyed man can see; a lame man can walk. But when they step on the
tail of a tiger, the tiger will bite. Misfortune. The warrior conducts himself like a
great prince.

Ritsema/Karcher: Squinting enabling observing. Halting enabling Treading.
Treading a tiger's tail. Snapping-at people: pitfall. Martial people activating:
tending-towards a Great Chief.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Shaughnessy: The blind are able to see, the lame are able to tread. Treading on
a tiger's tail; for a real man inauspicious. A military man is united with the great
lord.

Cleary(1): Able to see with a squint, able to walk with a limp. When they tread
on the tiger’s tail, it bites people. Inauspicious. A soldier becomes a ruler.

Cleary(2): The squint-eyed can see, the lame can walk. Treading on a tiger’s tail,
they get bitten, unfortunately. A military man becomes a civil leader.

Wu: A person can look with one injured eye. A person can tread with one lame
leg. He will get bitten by treading behind a tiger. It will be foreboding. He is like a
warrior trying to be a ruler.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: "A one-eyed man who thinks he can see": he is not fit to see
clearly. "A lame man who thinks that he can tread well": one cannot walk along
with him. "The ill fortune of being bitten" arises from the place not being the
proper one for him. "A mere bravo acting the part of a great ruler": this is owing
to his aims being too violent.

Confucius/Wilhelm/Baynes: "A one-eyed man is able to see," but not enough
for clarity. "A lame man is able to tread," but not enough to tread with others.
The misfortune in the biting of the man is due to the fact that the place is not
appropriate. "Thus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince," because his
will is firm.

Confucius/Blofeld: The one-eyed man does see, but not clearly; the lame man
can walk, but not keep up with the others. The disaster suffered by the man who
gets bitten is indicated by this line's unsuitable position. The warrior undertakes
his lord's affairs because the latter is strong of will.

Confucius/Ritsema/Karcher: "Squinting enabling observing." Not the stand
to use possessing brightness indeed. "Halting enabling Treading." Not the stand
to use associating-with moving indeed. "Snapping-at people's pitfall." Situation
not appropriate indeed. "Martial people activating: tending-towards a Great
Chief." Purpose solid indeed.

Confucius/Cleary(2): The squint-eyed can see, but not clearly; the lame can
walk, but not well enough to be companions on a journey. The misfortune of
being bitten is that of being in an inappropriate place. When a military man
becomes a civil leader, his determination is adamant.

Confucius/Wu: “A person can look with one injured eye,” but he cannot see
clearly. “A person can tread with one lame leg,” but he cannot walk with firm
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

steps. He will have the misfortune of being bitten, because his position is
improper. “A warrior wants to be a ruler,” because his idea is adamant.

Legge: Line three is neither central nor in a magnetic place, which would be
proper to it. But with the strength of will which the occupant of a dynamic place
should possess, he goes forward with the evil results cited. The editors of the
imperial edition, in illustration of the closing sentence, refer to Analects VII, x.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man recklessly exposes himself to danger, which exceeds his powers of
handling. He invites disaster thereby.

Wing: You are not suited for the ambitiousness of your goals. Your powers are
not adequate. Willfulness on your part could end in disaster. Such Conduct is
only for someone willing to throw himself away for a superior.

Editor: The content here does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism for a
magnetic line. Legge and Wu’s interpretation of the line and Confucian
commentary differ conceptually from the other translators. For purposes of
comparison I have rendered all versions of the Confucian commentary more
thoroughly than usual. As the only magnetic line in the hexagram, three is
outclassed and overwhelmed, yet still serves the ruler. If this is the only changing
line, The Dynamic emerges, with a corresponding line of: "We see its subject as
the superior man active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful
and apprehensive. The position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake." The
image suggests a warrior who has only partial comprehension of a dangerous
situation; his ability to serve his ruler is also impeded. Despite these handicaps,
his devotion is such that he will expose himself to great danger in the service of
his Lord, and suffer because of it.

If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a Samurai is, its
basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master.
Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai

A. The image is one of inadequate strength or resources to deal with a
superior force. Regardless, the confrontation seems to be mandated: thus does
the ego serve the Self.

B. Serve the Work with a warrior's spirit: "Yours is not to reason why,
yours is but to do or die."

C. Even when one's heart is in the right place, partial comprehension and
insufficient ability can be expected to create distress.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Alternate: This line can also suggest foolhardy arrogance rather than
blind obedience to a superior. In such instances, the familiar Lady from Liger
limerick seems more appropriate:

There was an old lady of Liger
Who went riding on the back of a tiger.
They came back from the ride
With the lady inside
And a smile on the face of the tiger.

D. Incompetence plus arrogance equals disaster.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject treading on the tail of a tiger.
He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He treads on the tail of the tiger. Caution and
circumspection lead ultimately to good fortune.

Blofeld: To tread with impunity upon a tiger's tail, breathless caution is
required -- good fortune in the end. [This is an occasion for doing something
dangerous, provided we are very cautious.]

Liu: He steps on the tail of the tiger. Caution and fearfulness. Good fortune in
the end. [Trouble or disaster threaten and one must be very careful.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Treading at tiger's tail. Pleading, pleading; completing
significant.

Shaughnessy: Treading on a tiger's tail so panicky; in the end auspicious.

Cleary(1): Treading on the tail of a tiger, with caution it will turn out well.

Cleary(2): Treading on a tiger’s tail with utmost caution turns out lucky.

Wu: Treading after a tiger is awesome, but it will be auspicious in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His aim takes effect. Wilhelm/Baynes: What is willed is
done. Blofeld: The ruler's will is carried out. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose
moving indeed. Cleary(2): Utmost caution turning out lucky is determined
action. Wu: With awe there will be auspiciousness in the end, because the
aspiration will prevail.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Legge: Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place just below the ruler in line five.
He recognizes his weak position and walks with care.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man successfully undertakes dangerous enterprises by proceeding with
caution and circumspection.

Wing: You can now undertake even dangerous endeavors if you proceed with
great caution.

Editor: This is the first line of the upper trigram, symbolizing the tiger's tail. The
image depicts impeccable courage and willpower that conquers a dangerous
situation.

The step to higher consciousness leads us out and away from all rear-
guard cover and from all safety measures. The individual must give
himself to the new way completely, for it is only by means of his integrity
that he can go further, and only his integrity can guarantee that his way
does not turn out to be an absurd adventure.
Jung -- The Secret of the Golden Flower

A. Proceed with caution. "Discretion is the better part of valor."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the resolute tread of its subject. Though he
be firm and correct, there will be peril.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Resolute conduct. Perseverance with awareness of danger.

Blofeld: He treads delicately. Persistence could lead to trouble.

Liu: Continue in a decisive manner. Danger. [There is now a tendency to rush
and be careless. By all means stop this, or troubles will mount and disaster will
come.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Parting Treading. Trial: adversity.

Shaughnessy: Resolute treading; determination is dangerous.

Cleary (1): Treading decisively. Even if one is upright, there is danger. [It is
necessary to be upright and undivided, to master oneself in danger, so that one
can avoid the problem of losing what has been gained. This is treading the Path
in which there is no one but oneself.]
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

Cleary (2): Decisive treading is correct yet dangerous.

Wu: He decides on treading. Despite perseverance, he is in a difficult situation.
[Use your power wisely and judiciously, or you will fall.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to his being in the position that is correct and
appropriate to him. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is correct and appropriate.
Blofeld: This trouble could arise despite the suitable position of the line. [A
firm line between two firm ones is usually an omen of strength and
compatibility, but not in this case. Thus, even though we are quite certain our
course is a right one and we therefore follow it boldly, trouble cannot be
avoided; we should either walk delicately or refrain from the course
altogether.] Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correcting appropriate indeed.
Cleary(2): Decisive treading is correct yet dangerous; the position is
appropriate. Wu: (This is) his proper position notwithstanding.

Legge: Beneath the symbolism under line five lies the principle that humility is
the better part of propriety. Line five, who is dynamic and central, will not be
lacking in this, but bear in mind that the higher he is exalted, the greater may be
his fall.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Peril is evident, as when treading on the tail of a tiger. But the man remains
aware and resolute, acting with propriety and humility.

Wing: What you propose to do is dangerous, yet your awareness of such danger
will give you the strength to succeed. The time requires a firm commitment to
your endeavor. If you do not have a real commitment in your heart you should re-
examine your path.

Editor: Line five is mentioned in the Confucian commentary for the hexagram
as occupying the "God-given position." Nevertheless, despite his will and
intelligence, he faces a volatile situation which will demand all of his resources if
he is to succeed. Ritsema/Karcher render "adversity," (LI) as: Danger,
threatening, malevolent demon ... It indicates a spirit or ghost that seeks
revenge by inflicting suffering upon the living. Pacifying or exorcizing such a
spirit can have a healing effect. Wu’s commentary offers a useful slant on this:
“De-emphasize (your) own opinions – listen to the deliberations of others.”

The good or ill of man lies within his own will.
Epictetus

10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10

A. Walking a razor's edge -- maintain vigilance over your choices and be
aware of their consequences. The image suggests willpower in the face of
potentially disruptive forces. "It all depends on you."
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, tells us to look at the whole course that is
trodden, and examine the presage which that gives. If it be complete and without
failure, there will be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs. When
everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.

Blofeld: If they watch their step (or look to their conduct) and heed the omens,
sublime good fortune will be theirs.

Liu: Observe your conduct and examine the signs carefully. There will be great
good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Observing Treading, predecessor auspicious. One's
recurring Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Looking and treading crafty and soaring its revolving; prime
auspiciousness.

Cleary (2): Observing the treading, considering what is felicitous, the return is
auspicious.

Wu: Examination of the treading records gives a sense of completion. If errors in
treading are avoided, there will be great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is a matter for congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes: The
topmost place carries great blessing. Blofeld: The sublime good fortune
presaged by this top line takes the form of immense felicity. Ritsema/
Karcher: The great possesses reward indeed. Cleary (2): There is much
celebration. Wu: Great joy.

Legge: What is said of line six is good, but is only a truism. The whole course has
been shown. If every step has been right and appropriate, the issue will be very
good.
10 -- Cautious Advance -- 10
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The work is ended and the past course is reviewed. If it has been
appropriate and thorough, good fortune is assured.

Wing: Take a long look at what your Conduct in the situation has achieved
thus far. If you are on the right path you will know by the good it has produced. It
is time for a reevaluation of your goals. By examining the past you may now get a
glimpse of the future.

Editor: There is an affinity here with the message in the Image of the superior
man "discriminating between high and low," and essentially putting his house in
order. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number fifty-eight,
Joy, which intimates that one has successfully passed a test -- in which case the
line is an injunction to review the situation and see what we did right.

God saw all that He had made,
and indeed it was very good.
Genesis 1:31

A. The Work is a dynamic process which requires continuous evaluation
and adjustment. Review the Work, then review your options.

Judgment

Legge: Harmony shows the inferior departed and the great arrived. There will
be good fortune with progress and success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Peace. The small departs, the great approaches. Good
fortune. Success.

Blofeld: Peace. The mean decline; the great and good approach -- good fortune
and success! [In the following hexagram (Divorcement), where the trigrams
symbolize heaven and earth in what would appear to be their normal positions,
that arrangement is held to be disastrous; whereas here, where they seem to be
upside down, everything is propitious. This may be because heaven above earth
is held to imply that the two are existing separately without the intercourse
which is the root of all growth; whereas here their intercourse is so absolute
that heaven is actually supporting earth.]

Liu: Peace. The small is departing, the great is arriving. Good fortune. Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Pervading. The small going, the great coming.
significance Growing. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
prospering and expanding. It emphasizes that continually spreading this
prosperity through communicating is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Greatness: the little go and the great come; auspicious; receipt.

Cleary (1): The small goes, the great comes. This is auspicious and
developmental.

Cleary (2): Tranquility ... Getting through auspiciously.

Wu: Prosperity shows that the small stays outside and the great stays inside. It
will be auspicious and pervasive.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

The Image

Legge: The intercourse of heaven and earth -- the image of Harmony. The wise
ruler models his laws upon the principles of heaven and earth, and enforces them
for the people's benefit.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven and earth unite: the image of Peace. Thus the ruler
divides and completes the course of heaven and earth; he furthers and regulates
the gifts of heaven and earth, and so aids the people.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes heaven and earth in communion. [The
component trigrams illustrate the kind of close intercourse just alluded to. This
is surely the only way of depicting it under the circumstances, for any mingling
of their component lines would produce quite different trigrams having no
reference to heaven and earth.] It is as though a mighty ruler, by careful
regulation of affairs, has brought to fruition the way of heaven and earth. In
harmony with the sequence of their motions, he gives help to people on every
hand.

Liu: Heaven and earth are unified, symbolizing Peace. The ruler reforms and
completes the way of heaven and earth; He observes the appropriate methods of
heaven and earth to direct the people.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven and Earth mingling. Pervading. The crown-
prince uses property to accomplish Heaven and Earth's tao. The crown-prince
uses bracing to mutualize Heaven and Earth's propriety. The crown-prince uses
the left to right the commoners.

Cleary (1): When heaven and earth commune, there is tranquility. Thus does
the ruler administer the way of heaven and earth and assist the proper balance of
heaven and earth, thereby helping the people.

Cleary (2): ... So as to influence the people.

Wu: Prosperity results from the interaction of heaven and earth. The king uses
the wealth of the nation to achieve the ways of heaven and earth and to support
their designs, so as to bring the sentiments of the people to the center.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Harmony shows the union of heaven and earth, and all
things consequently united -- high and low, superior and inferior are all in
accord. The lower trigram is made up of dynamic lines, and the upper of
magnetic lines: strength is within, devotion is without; the superior man is inside
and increasing, the inferior man is outside and decreasing.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Legge: The Judgment refers to the structure of the hexagram, with the three
dynamic lines below, and the three magnetic lines above. The former are "the
great," active and vigorous; the latter are "the inferior," passive and yielding. In
many editions of the I Ching beneath the hexagram of Harmony there appears
hexagram number fifty-four, Propriety, which becomes Harmony if the third
and fourth lines exchange places. A situation in which the motive forces are
represented by three dynamic, and the opposing by three magnetic lines, must be
progressive and successful. Harmony is called the hexagram of the first month
of the natural spring, when for six months the forces of growth are in ascendance.

Canon McClatchie translates: "The Image means that heaven and earth
have now conjugal intercourse with each other, and the upper and lower classes
unite together."

Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image that a ruler should frame his laws to operate
like the seasons, so that the people exist within the structure of a natural rather
than an arbitrary order.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Harmony depicts the waning of egotistical illusions and the
waxing of true potential.

The Superior Man allows his inner virtue to rule the psyche.

Without changing lines, Harmony suggests a fruitful union of opposites
and consequent state of balance in the matter at hand.

Wilhelm translates the opening phrase of the Confucian commentary as:
"Heaven and earth unite." Blofeld renders it: "The celestial and terrestrial forces
have intercourse and all things are in communion with one another." Legge has
already called attention to McClatchie's version of: "Heaven and earth have now
conjugal intercourse with each other."

This image is one of the most universal symbols produced by the human
psyche: the sexual union of Spirit and Matter (heaven and earth). This is the
hieros gamos or holy marriage of alchemy, the union of Shiva and Shakti in
Hinduism, the conjoined male and female deities in tantric Buddhism, the
syzygies of Gnosticism and the union of heaven and earth in the Kabbalah.

The notions of the couple and the sacred marriage held a very important
place in ancient Chinese religious thinking. Every sacred power was
twofold, male and female; but since only one half of the sacred couple
was generally enclosed in any one sanctuary, the ritual was directed at
reconstituting the whole... The complete being is male and female; since
most men neglect or repress their feminine nature, they are out of
balance; their male aggressiveness comes to the fore, and their whole

11 -- Harmony -- 11

vitality suffers. There can be no true Holiness without a prior
revitalization of femininity.
M. Kaltenmark -- Lao Tzu and Taoism

Psychologically, the condition pictured by this hexagram is a metaphor for
a high state of integration within the psyche. Here it is described in alchemical
and Jungian terminology:

The hermetic vessel is oneself. In it the many pieces of psychic stuff
scattered throughout one's world must be collected and fused into one, so
making a new creation. In it must occur the union of the opposites called
by the alchemists the coniunctio or marriage... (This union), in
psychological terms corresponds to man with his feminine soul, the
anima, or to a woman with her masculine counterpart, the animus -- the
union in each case constituting the inner marriage, the hieros gamos by
which the individual must become whole.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

To receive this hexagram does not necessarily mean that one has attained
such a high integration, but it might indicate a step in that direction. The ultimate
hieros gamos only occurs after all of the scattered and mismatched forces within
the psyche have been brought together in correct alignment -- in I Ching terms,
when all of the lines are in their proper places with proper correlates as imaged in
hexagram number 63, Completion. Until this final union there are innumerable
"lesser" conjunctions which must first take place -- a fact recognized in tantric
yoga:

The final goal of the tantricist is to reunite the two contrary principles --
Shiva and Shakti -- in his own body. When Shakti, who sleeps, in the
shape of a serpent, at the base of his body, is awoken by certain yogic
techniques, she moves through a medial channel by way of the chakras
up to the top of the skull, where Shiva dwells, and unites with him. The
union of the divine pair within his own body transforms the yogin into a
kind of "androgyne." But it must be stressed that "androgynization" is
only one aspect of a total process, that of the reunion of the opposites.
Actually, Tantric literature speaks of a great number of "opposing pairs"
that have to be reunited.
Mircea Eliade -- Myths, Rites, Symbols

The establishment of the "Kingdom of Heaven on Earth" is yet another
metaphor for this process of psychic unification. Here is the Kabbalistic version:

It is by the establishment of the celestial on the terrestrial, or of heaven
upon earth, that the house of the King (humanity) will become united and
the King will rejoice thereat, for then the two kingdoms will become one
and then the new and living way will become opened to those who make
themselves susceptible and receptive of the Higher and Diviner life...

11 -- Harmony -- 11

When these two worlds become united and blended together they are
symbolized by the union of the male and female, the one being the
complement of the other.
The Zohar

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Legge points out that many editions of the I Ching associate hexagram
number fifty-four, Propriety, with this figure. What do the changing third and
fourth lines of Propriety imply about the role of the ego in the Work? The
traditional name for Propriety is "The Marrying Maiden" -- how does that
relate to the concept of the holy marriage in Harmony? Compare the
Judgments and Images of the two hexagrams and the role of the superior man in
each. Note also the lesson implied when lines two and five in Harmony unite to
make hexagram number sixty-three, Completion.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, suggests the idea of grass pulled up, and bringing
with it other stalks with whose roots it is connected. Advance on the part of its
subject will be fortunate.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it. Each
according to his kind. Undertakings bring good fortune.

Blofeld: When grass is uprooted, what is attached to it is pulled up as well. It is
an auspicious time for advancing according to plan. [This would seem to mean
that we are likely to get what we seek plus something more.]

Liu: When ribbon grass is pulled out, its roots come with it: they are of the same
kind. Undertakings lead to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Eradicating thatch-grass intertwined. Using one's
classification. Chastising significant.

Shaughnessy: Plucking the cogon-grass stem with its roots; to be upright is
auspicious.

Cleary (1): When pulling out a reed by the roots, other roots come with it. It is
auspicious to go forth.

Wu: Like pulling up reeds with all their connecting roots, advancing will be
auspicious.
11 -- Harmony -- 11
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His will is set on what is external to himself. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The will is directed outward. Blofeld: The mind is outward looking
(i.e. fixed upon the people's welfare.) [This really means the mind of the Superior
Man, whose duty it is to look after the people’s welfare. If he is truly a Superior
Man, when his mind is turned inward it is to meditate upon and eradicate his
faults; when outward turned, it is concentrated upon his duty to the ruler
(provided the king is worthy) and his care of the people.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Purpose located outside indeed. Cleary (2): Means focusing the will beyond.
Wu: Because the aspiration is to go upward.

Legge: The symbolism of the first line is suggested by the three dynamic lines of
the lower trigram, all together, and all possessed by the same instinct to advance.
The movement of the first line will be supported by the others, and will be
fortunate. "He has his will set on what is external to himself" means that he is
bent on going forward.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man brings others of like mind with him as he enters
public office during a period of prosperity.

Wing: Actions that you might now take, particularly those actions that are
connected to the welfare of others, will meet with good fortune. You will attract
others and find co- operation among those who have goals similar to your own.

Editor: This line changes the hexagram to number forty-six, Pushing
Upward, another image of growth with a corresponding line which further
reinforces the idea of upward progress: "Advancing upward with the welcome of
those above him..." "Grass roots" are a foundation, source or essence, as in “grass
roots support” in a political campaign. To "uproot" is to remove from a fixed or
entrenched position. "Other stalks" are analogous elements -- "fellow travelers."
The image suggests the positive alteration of a heretofore static situation.

When the shadow has been made conscious and has been accepted as
part of the personality, its contents and part of its energies are added to
those of the ego, so that a further development of the I results. Similarly,
when the anima or animus has been united to the conscious psyche by a
process described in many religious systems as an inner marriage, a
further enlargement of consciousness results, and the conscious
personality begins to display those qualities of dignity and stability
which are the marks of the unique or individuated personality.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Removal from an entrenched position advances the general welfare. Go
beyond yourself.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

B. A union of similar forces moves progressively.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows one who can bear with the uncultivated,
will cross the river without a boat, does not forget the distant, and has no selfish
friendships. Thus does he prove himself acting in accordance with the due mean.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness, fording the river
with resolution, not neglecting what is distant, not regarding one's companions:
thus one may manage to walk in the middle.

Blofeld: Supporting the uncultivated, crossing the river without boats, not
retreating despite the distance from his base, not abandoning his comrades, he
still manages to steer a middle course.

Liu: Bear with the undeveloped. Swim across the river decisively, not forgetting
what is remote, nor disregarding one's friends. Thus one can gain the middle way.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping wasteland. Availing-of crossing the channel.
Not putting-off abandoning. Partnering extinguished. Acquiring honor, tending-
towards centering moving.

Shaughnessy: Wrapped recklessness; herewith ford the river; not distantly
leaving it behind and not forgetting it, gains elevation in the central ranks.

Cleary (1): Accepting the uncultivated, actively crossing rivers, not missing
the remote, partisanship disappears, and one accords with balanced action.

Cleary (2): ... Employing those who can cross rivers, not overlooking the
remote, free from partisanship, one can seriously perform balanced action.

Wu: This is like the sky enveloping all corners of the earth. Walking along a
riverbank, one will not lose the direction even going far. He will show no
favoritism toward friends. He will maintain a course of centrality.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His intelligence is bright and his capacity is great.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Because the light is great. Blofeld: A middle course can be
steered because the situation is so brilliantly clear. Ritsema/Karcher: Using
the shining great indeed. Cleary (2): Due to greatness of illumination. Wu:
Indicate an ability to attain enlightenment.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Legge: The second line is dynamic, but in a magnetic place. This tempers his
action and describes his first characteristic of forbearance. Because the place is
central and has a proper correlate above in the fifth place, all the favorable
images are manifested.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man observes the mean during times of peace. He is magnanimous
toward the uncultivated, ready for necessary risks, watchful over future
possibilities, and independent of cliques and factions.

Wing: During Prospering times it is important to hold to worthy attitudes and
behavior in order to achieve your aim. You now have a responsibility to
undertake difficult tasks, to be tolerant of all people, and to maintain far-reaching
visions. Avoid getting involved in current factions and special-interest groups.

Editor: Wilhelm/Baynes translate "no selfish friendships" as: "not regarding
one's companions." The idea is that correct behavior takes precedence over
popular opinion. Thoreau's famous line: "If a man does not keep pace with his
companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer," is an analogous
idea. The discipline of the Work immediately places one in this category. A
complete understanding of this line depends upon what is said in line five, which
see.

From my point of view, he can be called a remarkable man who stands
out from those around him by the resourcefulness of his mind, and who
knows how to be restrained in the manifestations which proceed from
his nature, at the same time conducting himself justly and tolerantly
towards the weaknesses of others.
Gurdjieff

A. Turmoil is a fact of life. Unaffected by conventional norms, one bucks
the current of ignorance and focuses on the goals of the Work. Cope competently.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows that, while there is no state of peace that
is not liable to be disturbed, and no departure of evil men so that they shall not
return, yet when one is firm and correct, as he realizes the distresses that may
arise, he will commit no error. There is no occasion for sadness at the certainty of
such recurring changes; and in this mood the happiness of the present may be
long enjoyed.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No plain not followed by a slope. No going not followed by a
return. He who remains persevering in danger is without blame. Do not complain
about this truth; enjoy the good fortune you still possess.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Blofeld: Every plain is followed by a slope; every going forth is followed by a
return. Persistence under difficulty will not lead to error. Do not lose faith, for an
eclipse is sometimes a blessing. [The whole of this passage suggests present
difficulties which we can surely overcome.]

Liu: No plain without a slope. No departure without a return. Continuing in a
difficult situation. No blame. Do not fear; face the truth. One receives blessings.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without evening, not unevening. Without going, not
returning. Drudgery, Trial: without fault. No cares: one's conforming. Tending-
towards taking-in possesses blessing.

Shaughnessy: There is no flat that does not slope, there is no going that does
not return; in determination about difficulty, there is no trouble; do not pity his
return; in eating there is good fortune.

Cleary (1): There is no levelness without incline, no going without returning. If
one is upright in difficulty, there will be no fault. One should not grieve over one’s
sincerity; there will be prosperity in sustenance.

Cleary (2): ... Be upright in difficulty and you will be blameless, etc.

Wu: There are no level roads without inclinations and no past events without
recurrences. In a difficult time, perseverance will bring no error. Do not pity, but
be sincere. There will be happiness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: "There is no going away so that there shall not be a return"
refers to this as the point where the interaction of Heaven and Earth takes place.
Wilhelm/Baynes: This is the boundary of heaven and earth. Blofeld: ... Is a
law of the universe. Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven and Earth, the border indeed.
Cleary (2): The border of heaven and earth. Wu: Is a condition prevailing
between heaven and earth.

Legge: The symbolism of the third line shows the constant change that is taking
place in nature and human affairs. As night becomes day, and winter becomes
summer, so calamity may be expected to follow prosperity, and decay the
flourishing of a state. The third is the last line in the lower trigram of Strength, by
whose creative activity the happy state of Harmony has been produced.
Another aspect of things may be expected, but by firmness and correctness the
good estate of the present may be long continued.
11 -- Harmony -- 11
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Change is certain. Peace is followed by disturbances; departure of evil men
by their return. Such recurrences should not constitute occasions for sadness but
realities for awareness, so that one may be happy in the interim.

Wing: You may see a decision approaching, for the laws of change are eternally
active. Any difficulties can be endured with an inner faith in your own strength
and perseverance. Meanwhile, enjoy fully the present.

Editor: There is a similarity between this line and line three of hexagram
number twenty-six, Controlled Power. The idea is that one finds the peace
and harmony one seeks in life by staying on the cutting edge of experience, by
learning how to be content with what is as it continuously unfolds. This is the
essence of existential beingness, of Zen-mind.

Regarding alike pleasure and pain,
Gain and loss, success and defeat, prepare
Yourself for battle. Thus you will
Incur no sin.
Bhagavad-Gita

A. Change is inevitable: Trust the Work to guide you.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject fluttering down -- not relying
on her own rich resources, but calling in her neighbors. They all come not as
having received warning, but in the sincerity of their hearts.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He flutters down, not boasting of his wealth, together with
his neighbor, guileless and sincere.

Blofeld: Running to and fro, kept from riches by those around him, he does not
cease to put his trust in them. [He runs to and fro in his anxiety to be of service,
whether people reward his kindness or not.]

Liu: One strives with a cheerful manner, not boasting of riches to a neighbor.
One has full confidence without fear.

Ritsema/Karcher: Fluttering, fluttering. Not affluence: using one's neighbor.
Not warning: using conforming.

Shaughnessy: So fluttering, not wealthy together with his neighbors; not
warned about his return.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Cleary (1): Unsettled, one is not rich, along with the neighbors, being loyal
without admonition.

Cleary (2): Unsettled, not prosperous, one works with the neighbor. Sincerity is
exercised, without caution.

Wu: Carefree like a flying bird, he is not in a position to accumulate wealth, but
rather to share his affection with his neighbors. He is free from anxiety, for he
has the confidence of others.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Both she and her neighbors are out of their real place where
they are. This is what they have desired in the core of their hearts. Wilhelm/
Baynes: All of them have lost what is real. He desires it in the depths of his
heart. Blofeld: His running to and fro and his lack of riches are due to his
idealism. He preserves his faith in others because in his heart of hearts he
WANTS to trust them. Ritsema/Karcher: Altogether letting-go substance
indeed. Centering the heart desiring indeed. Cleary (2): Being unsettled and not
prospering are both due to loss of the real. Exercise of sincerity without caution is
the heart’s true desire. Wu: He is destined to remain empty ... Because his
willingness to share comes from his heart.

Legge: The subjects of the fourth and other yin lines of the upper trigram are not
to be seen as opponents of the yang lines in the lower trigram, but as their
correlates. They are of one heart and mind to maintain the state of Harmony,
and humbly and readily yield their power to the yang lines below. Chu Hsi says
that the upper lines "have lost their substantiality." As magnetic lines, their
proper place is below.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man of high rank joins with the lowly in an atmosphere of spontaneity
and mutual confidence.

Wing: The important thing now is that you are sincerely united and
communicating with people who are your superiors. Pay no thought to ultimate
rewards but maintain a steady course toward your aim. Use the help of others, if
offered.

Editor: None of the translations of this line say quite the same thing, yet the
meaning is clear enough when interpreted in relation to the symbolism of the
figure as a whole. This is the first magnetic line of the hexagram, and the
message is stated in terms of a female sexual response. She doesn't rely upon her
"rich resources" -- she doesn't use her magnetic power aggressively, but willingly
surrenders to dynamic initiative. Psychologically this means that Eros defers to
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Logos, emotion to reason, ego to Self, or whatever the situation at hand suggests
is a proper subordination of one principle to another.

In every exposition of the Perennial Philosophy the human soul is
regarded as feminine in relation to the Godhead, the personal God and
even the Order of Nature. Hubris, which is the original sin, consists in
regarding the personal ego as self-sufficiently masculine in relation to
the Spirit within and to Nature without, and in behaving accordingly.
Aldous Huxley

A. The image suggests the voluntary surrender of power and position to
create a higher alliance of forces.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, reminds us of king Ti-yi's rule about the
marriage of his younger sister. By such a course there is happiness and there will
be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The sovereign I gives his daughter in marriage. This brings
blessing and supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: By giving his daughter in marriage, the Emperor attained felicity and
extreme good fortune.

Liu: The Emperor I gives his daughter in marriage. This will bring blessings and
great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The supreme burgeoning, converting maidenhood. Using
satisfaction, Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Di Yi marries off the maiden by age; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): The emperor marries off his younger sister, whereby there is
good fortune; this is very auspicious.

Wu: Di Yi married off his younger sister. The marriage was blessed with great
happiness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She employs the virtues proper to her central position to
carry her wishes into effect. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because he is central in carrying
out what he desires. Blofeld: This was because of his impartiality in carrying
out what he felt to be desirable. [This suggests a need for impartiality in
conducting our affairs.] Ritsema/Karcher: Center uses moving desire indeed.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Cleary (2): The balanced carrying out of deliberate, purposeful undertakings.
Wu: It was done with a wish from a central position.

Legge: According to Ch'eng-tzu, Ti-yi was the first to enact a law that daughters
of the royal house, in marrying princes of the states, should be in subjection to
them, as if they were not superior to them in rank. Here line five, while occupying
the place of dignity and authority in the hexagram, is yet a magnetic line in the
place of a dynamic one. She accordingly humbly condescends to her dynamic and
proper correlate in line two.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The example of King I's decree that his younger sister must obey her
outranked husband is presented. The modest union of the high and the low
brings real satisfaction.

Wing: You can achieve your aim and realize great good fortune by remaining
impartial in your behavior. Humility and modesty will allow you to communicate
with the sentiments of your followers in mind. You will then be supported in your
endeavors.

Editor: The rulership of the hexagram is shared jointly by the second and fifth
lines. In the situation symbolized here, the magnetic fifth line yields her authority
to the dynamic second line -- each is out of its "correct" place, and so they swap
positions, so to speak. The meaning is that yin willingly defers to yang, female
yields to male, emotions to intellect, feelings to principle, etc. It is significant to
note that in a hexagram depicting a holy marriage, the perfect union of Heaven
and Earth, that the only line mentioning marriage is this one. The marriage is
between lines two and five, and when they both change the hexagram created is
number 63, After Completion, the "perfect" or reference hexagram
determining all correct relationships. Lines two and five are the only lines in the
figure that are "out of place," and each takes its meaning from the other, which
implies that they exchange places to create a perfect configuration. Implicit in all
this is the idea of yin (emotion) being correct when it is alchemically conjoined
with yang (reason). Emotion and intellect must blend into intuition. The ego
can't "make" this happen, but it can help create the conditions which make it
possible.

When the understanding of truth which is with the man makes one with
the affection of good which is with the woman, there is a conjunction of
the two minds into one. This conjunction is the spiritual marriage from
which conjugal love descends; for when the two minds are so conjoined
that they become one mind, there is love between them.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

A. Defer feelings to reason or principle.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

B. Ego defers to the will of the Self.

C. A fundamental rule of the Work is to concede one's initiative to a higher
principle.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows us the city wall returned to the moat. It is
not the time to use the army. The subject of the line may announce her orders to
the people of her own city; but however firm and correct she may be, she will
have cause for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wall falls back into the moat. Use no army now. Make
your commands known within your own town. Perseverance brings humiliation.

Blofeld: The wall has tumbled into the moat; do not put up a fight, but just
maintain order in the village. Although this is the right course blame cannot be
avoided. [We shall be blamed for not being more aggressive even though
circumstances more than warrant our failure to be so.]

Liu: The wall collapses into the moat. Do not use force. Make announcements to
the people in your own town. Continuing brings humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: The bulwark returned tending-towards the moat. No
availing of legions. Originating-from the capital, notifying fate. Trial: abashment.

Shaughnessy: The city wall falls into the moat; do not use troops; from the city
announce the mandate; determination is stressful.

Cleary (1): The castle walls crumble back into dry moats. Don’t use the army.
Giving orders in one’s own domain, even if right, there will be regret.

Cleary (2): ... Announcing order in one’s own locality is shameful, in spite of
correctness.

Wu: The moat around the city wall has dried. No military action is advisable. The
local authority has given conflicting orders to the townspeople. The people should
be persevering, but even so they may still feel humiliated.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The governmental orders have long been in disorder.
Wilhelm/Baynes: His plans fall into confusion. Blofeld: This signifies a
troubled destiny. Ritsema/Karcher: One's fate disarrayed indeed. Cleary
(2): Order is in disarray. Wu: The orders have been contradictory.
11 -- Harmony -- 11

Legge: The course denoted by Harmony has been run, and will be followed by
one of a different and unhappy character. The earth dug from the moat had been
built up to form a projecting wall, but it is now again fallen into the ditch. War
will only aggravate the evil, and however the ruler may address good
proclamations to the people of the capital, the coming evil cannot be altogether
averted.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The government has long been in disarray. Despite all proclamations to the
contrary, ill fortune is at hand. War will only aggravate the situation. The subject
should submit to fate, keep inwardly free, and ameliorate the harm done to those
nearest him. The bad time will pass.

Wing: A decline has begun. It is of the external world, and nothing can be done
to hold it back. Such attempts will bring you humiliation. Instead, devote your
time to strengthening your ties with those close to you.

Editor: A walled city is a concentration of similar elements in one place. Within
its walls dwell all of the factors which go to make up whatever it is that the city
represents-- perhaps an attitude or belief. For example: suppose I believe that the
world is flat. All of the thoughts, feelings, attitudes and emotions which
contribute to this belief live in "the city." If I have an experience which strongly
challenges my belief--say, a photograph taken of the earth from outer space
which definitely proves that my belief in a flat earth is incorrect--then one could
say that the "walls of my city have collapsed." Now I could fight this and say that
obviously the outer space photograph is a fake--I could try to maintain my belief
regardless of all the evidence to the contrary. However, the realistic response to
the situation would not be to "use the army" (defend the indefensible), but to just
let the dust settle--inform the people in the city (the now outmoded thoughts and
feelings) that the situation has changed and that the best response is to sit tight
and see what emerges from the rubble.

A community's conviction system is its castle, a walled city to protect it
against alternative interpretations of the great and unknown reality in
the midst of which it must somehow live.
B. Bruteau -- The Psychic Grid

A. A distinction is dissolved, a belief is shattered. Don't fight it -- let it be.
Change is in process and confusion prevails -- control your emotions and
maintain order within the psyche. Despite turmoil, take no action -- allow the
transformation to complete itself.

12 -- Divorcement --12
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWELVE --
DIVORCEMENT

Other titles: Standstill, The Symbol of Closing, Stagnation, Obstruction, The
Wife, Obstructed, Decadence, Disjunction, Impasse, "Yin supporting yang which
is wrong, they part company. Bad prospects for marriage or partnership. " --
D.F. Hook

Judgment:

Legge: Divorcement means there is a lack of communication between the
different classes of men. This is unfavorable to the superior man. The great has
departed and the inferior has arrived.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Standstill. Evil people do not further the perseverance of
the superior man. The great departs; the small approaches.

Blofeld: Stagnation (obstruction) caused by evil doers. Although the omen
portends ill for the Superior Man, he must not slacken his righteous persistence.
The great and the good decline; the mean approach. [When heaven and earth
cease to co-operate, no growth is possible and stagnation results. The trigram
(earth), when in intercourse with heaven, has the auspicious meaning of glad
acceptance; but, when separated from heaven, it represents weakness and
darkness, etc.]

Liu: Stagnation. Stagnation is of no benefit, although not of man's doing. The
superior man carries on (according to his principles). The great is departing. The
small is arriving.

Ritsema/Karcher: Obstructing it, in-no-way people. Not Harvesting: chun
tzu, Trial. the great going, the small coming. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of being blocked or interfered with. It emphasizes that
accepting the hindrances that temporarily interrupt the flow of life and thwart
communication is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time,
you are told to: accept obstruction!]

Shaughnessy: The wife's non-persons; not beneficial for the gentleman to
determine; the great go, the little come.

Cleary (1): Obstruction’s denial of humanity does not make the superior
person’s rectitude beneficial. The great goes and the small comes.
12 -- Divorcement --12

Cleary (2): ... Does not make the leader’s correctness beneficial, etc.

Wu: Stagnation is destined to cause obstruction of normal course of action. It
is not beneficial to the jun zi who takes a persevering stand. The great goes out
and the small comes in.

The Image:

Legge: Heaven and earth are estranged -- the image of Divorcement. The
superior man preserves his virtue by withdrawing from evil, and refuses both
honor and wealth.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven and earth do not unite: the image of Standstill.
Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth in order to escape the
difficulties. He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes heaven and earth cut off from each other.
To conserve his stock of virtue, the Superior Man withdraws into himself and
thus escapes from the evil influences around him. He declines all temptations of
honor and riches. [To understand why the trigrams for heaven and earth
arranged in what seems to be their natural positions have this inauspicious
significance, see notes on the preceding hexagram, (Harmony).]

Liu: Heaven and earth are not united, symbolizing stagnation. The superior
man restrains himself to avoid danger. He seeks neither honor nor wealth.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven, earth, not mingling. Obstruction. A chun tzu
uses parsimonious actualizing-tao to cast-out heaviness. A chun tzu uses not
permitting splendor to use benefits. [Actualize-tao: Ability to follow the
course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos ... Linked with acquire, TE:
acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): When heaven and earth do not commune, there is obstruction.
The superior person therefore is parsimonious with power and avoids trouble,
not susceptible to elevation by emolument.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders ... should not prosper on wages.

Wu: ... The jun zi practices the virtue of frugality to alleviate difficulties,
but does not allow himself to be honored with official salary.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The unfavorable auspice of Divorcement is because
heaven and earth are not in communication, and all things consequently fail to
unite. High and low, superior and inferior, do not meet in union, and there are no
well- regulated states in the kingdom. The lower trigram consists of magnetic
12 -- Divorcement --12

lines, and the upper of dynamic lines: darkness is within, clarity without;
weakness within, strength without. The lower trigram represents the advancing
inferior men, the upper trigram represents the retreating superior men.

Legge: The form of Divorcement is the exact opposite of Harmony, and
much of what has been said on the interpretation of that will apply to this.
Divorcement is the hexagram of the seventh month when the process of growth
has ended and increasing decay may be expected. The trigram of Earth is below
and that of Heaven is above, and since it is always proper for the lower trigram to
take the initiative, how can Earth take the place of Heaven? As in nature, it is
Heaven that originates, not Earth, and in a state the upper classes must take the
initiative, and not the lower.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The time is out of joint -- decadence waxes and virtue is mocked.

The Superior Man refuses to participate in the prevailing disorder.

If the preceding hexagram images the fruitful union of heaven and earth in
a holy marriage, this figure shows their Divorcement.

Divorcement: The act, process, or an instance of separating things
closely joined -- the state of being separated.

To receive this figure without changing lines suggests that you are
separated from truth or virtue, or that for the moment at least, the situation at
hand affords no possibility of reconciliation. During such conditions it would be
the height of folly to "wed oneself" to the prevailing disorder.

Note however that every line but the third shows some kind of effort to
reunite that which has been separated. The first shows an alliance of closely
related elements bent on serving the Work; line two depicts a kind of holding
action which is necessary to allow a superior element to prevail. The third line
identifies recalcitrant forces which prevent union, and four depicts another
alliance -- a higher octave of its first line correlate. Line five images nearly
complete re-unification and six shows the end of Divorcement. These images
suggest that although disunion prevails, the energy in the situation is promoting
connection.

As regards the Judgment:

Plato seems to have expressed Confucius' idea perfectly. In The
Republic he makes Socrates say that the true philosopher, finding
himself in an evil environment, "will not join in the wickedness of his
fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and
therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends,

12 -- Divorcement --12

and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing
any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own
way ... he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil
or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright
hopes."
H.G. Creel -- Confucius and the Chinese Way

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, suggests the idea of grass pulled up, and bringing
with it other stalks with whose roots it is connected. With firm correctness on the
part of its subject, there will be good fortune and progress.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it. Each
according to his kind. Perseverance brings good fortune and success.

Blofeld: When grass is uprooted, what is attached to it is pulled up as well.
Righteous persistence brings good fortune and success. [Although this hexagram
is ominous, the first line is auspicious. This sort of contradiction is common with
bottom and top lines, which are often held to precede or follow after the main
situation.]

Liu: When ribbon grass is pulled out, its roots come with it. They are of the same
kind. Continuing leads to success and good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Eradicating thatch-grass intertwined. Using one's
classification. Trial: significant. Growing.

Shaughnessy: Plucking the cogon-grass stem with its roots; determination is
auspicious; receipt.

Cleary (1): Pulling out roots of a reed takes others with it. It is good and
developmental to be correct.

Cleary (2): ... Correctness is auspicious and successful.

Wu: Like pulling reeds with all their connecting roots, it will be persevering,
auspicious and pervasive.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The will of the parties intended is bent on serving the ruler.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The will is directed to the ruler. Blofeld: The omen is
favorable owing to continued loyalty to the rule. [The ruler is now surrounded by
evil men or men of mean attainments, but the Superior Man continues to help
12 -- Divorcement --12

him.] Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose located-in a chief indeed. Cleary (2): The
will is in the leader. Wu: Because the aspiration is to serve the king.

Legge: Naturally we should expect the advance of the first of the three
magnetic lines to lead to evil. But if she sets herself to be firm and correct, she
will bring about a different issue. She is one of the cluster of inferior forces who
are able to change their mind, and set their hearts to love their ruler.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the inferior people are advancing. The man retires from
public office in order to preserve his integrity. He brings along his associates, who
are like the sod clinging to the uprooted grass.

Wing: If it is not possible to change or influence the current environment while
preserving the principles that have formed your character, then withdraw
completely. Success will come to you in a more profound sense than could be
realized from a compromising situation. Important associates may leave with
you. Good fortune.

Editor: Compare this with the first line of the preceding hexagram. In some
circumstances the meaning can be similar to the proverb: "Birds of a feather flock
together." In another sense, if "grass roots" are the foundation, source, bare
essence of something, then the first line can represent the roots of the lower
trigram, which is seen as a clump of grass or "cluster of inferior forces." The
image suggests the separation of oneself from an entrenched position and moving
upward. Confucius sees this movement as being in accord with the will of "the
ruler" -- in psychological terms: the will of the Self.

Endeavor to ascend into thyself, gathering in from the body all thy
members which have been dispersed and scattered into multiplicity from
that unity which once abounded in the greatness of its power. Bring
together and unify the inborn ideas and try to articulate those that are
confused and to draw into light those that are obscured.
Porphyry

A. A fundamental change for the better, or the first step toward unity:
grass-roots support.

B. An ascent from a fixed position. A confederation of lower elements
combines to serve a greater whole.

C. Form follows function. Stay connected with your origins/basic values in
context of hexagram’s meaning in Judgment and Image.

D. Action follows perception.
12 -- Divorcement --12
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject patient and obedient. To the
inferior man comporting himself so there will be good fortune. If the great man
comports himself as the distress and obstructions require, he will have success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: They bear and endure; This means good fortune for inferior
people. The standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.

Blofeld: Because they know how to please the authorities, fortune now favors
the mean, but the Superior Man prefers to contend with the causes of stagnation
in the realm. [He cares for the welfare of others more than for being in favor.]

Liu: Forbearance and obedience bring good fortune for the inferior. The
superior man is stagnant. But his purpose will succeed.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping receiving. Small People significant. Great
People Obstructed. Growing.

Shaughnessy: Wrapping the steamed offering: for the little man auspicious, for
the great man negative; receipt.

Cleary (1): Embracing servility, the petty person is lucky; for the great person,
obstruction is developmental.

Cleary (2): Embracing service, small people are lucky; great people get through
obstruction.

Wu: Using flattery to please the superior will bring good fortune to the little
man. The great man will find it obstruction to progress, but with patience, he will
turn obstruction into pervasion.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The great man does not allow himself to be disordered by
the herd of inferior men. Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not confuse the masses.
Blofeld: He does so by not entangling himself with the masses. Ritsema/
Karcher: Not disarraying the flock indeed. Cleary (2): They are not deranged
by the crowd. Wu: Because he despises the company of little men.

Legge: Patience and obedience are proper for the inferior man in all
circumstances. The subject of the second line is a great man, and occupies the
place in the center -- if, when confronted by difficulties he cherishes the
attributes of patience and obedience, he will soon have a happy issue out of the
distress.
12 -- Divorcement --12
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man achieves good fortune by patience and obedience to his superior,
who resolves his uncertainties. The great man, however, acts independently in
meeting the challenge of the circumstances.

Wing: It is better to quietly accept Stagnation than to attempt to influence the
leaders and willing victims of the situation. By remaining apart, you will not
corrupt your principles. Success is indicated.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the ego must always be aware of two realms
of power in the psyche: the differentiated complexes and the integrating
principle, or Self. In unifying its components, the Self sometimes uses strategies
which are beyond the comprehension of the ego. When such tactics are in effect,
it is time for the ego to "bear and endure" in good faith.

Thus the Hermetic treatise of rebirth describes the stages by which in the
mystical situation the astral soul is dissolved and the spiritual self
generated: one by one, the demonic powers (hailing from the Zodiac) are
ousted from the subject and replaced by "powers of God" descending into
it by grace and with their entrance progressively "composing" the new
person. The initiate, ascetically prepared, is throughout receptive rather
than active. With the dissolving of the former self he passes outside and
beyond himself into a different being.
-- H. Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion

A. Subordinate elements endure an impasse: the Self refuses to pander to
the illusions of its satellites. Sit tight and allow the situation to evolve. Trust the
Work.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject ashamed of the purpose folded
in her breast.

Wilhelm/Baynes: They bear shame.

Blofeld: He conceals his shame.

Liu: They bear with humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping embarrassing.

Shaughnessy: Wrapping: Enfolding sadness.

Cleary (1): Hiding shame.
12 -- Divorcement --12

Cleary (2): Embracing disgrace.

Wu: It indicates a cover-up of shame. [The little man wishes to undermine
progress. Since he is able to keep shame under wrap, there is no apparent
foreboding or regret.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to the inappropriateness of the position.
Wilhelm/Baynes: They bear shame because the place is not the right one.
Blofeld: This is indicated by the unsuitable position of the line. Ritsema/
Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): The position is not
appropriate. Wu: The position is improper.

Legge: The third line is magnetic in a dynamic place. She would vent her evil
purpose, but hasn't the strength to do so. Therefore she is left to the shame which
she ought to feel without a word of warning.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man feels inwardly ashamed for having acquired his position
illegitimately. But he does not have the strength to carry out his evil purpose.

Wing: Because of questionable methods and motives used to attain your
position, your plans will not come to fruition. There is some shame in this, but
therefore improvement.

Editor: Wilhelm and Liu both use the plural here: "They bear shame," and
"They bear with humiliation." I have received this line when it referred to
autonomous elements (inner complexes or other people) influencing the
situation; I have also received it directed at a consciously held attitude, as well as
describing another person’s hidden agenda. Part of the idea here is that for one to
mend one's ways one must first recognize one's errors and "feel shame" about
them. The prognosis is then favorable -- i.e.: "Go thy way and sin no more."
Sometimes this line can be a reprimand for asking the oracle a question you can
figure out for yourself.

We are still as possessed by our autonomous psychic contents as if they
were gods. Today they are called phobias, compulsions, and so forth, or
in a word, neurotic symptoms. The gods have become diseases; Zeus no
longer rules Olympus but the solar plexus, and creates specimens for the
physician's consulting room, or disturbs the brains of the politicians and
journalists who then unwittingly unleash mental epidemics.
Jung -- The Secret of the Golden Flower

A. Shame on you.
12 -- Divorcement --12

B. Shame on him, her, them or it.

C. Shame is “concealed” within brazen, unapologetic behavior.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject acting in accordance with the
ordination of Heaven, and committing no error. His companions will come and
share in his happiness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He who acts at the command of the highest remains without
blame. Those of like mind partake of the blessing.

Blofeld: Whatever is done in response to a command from on high cannot be a
wrong. His companions are also made illustrious and blessed. [Yet, according to
Confucius, if a ruler is wholly evil, he may be regarded as a bandit and
removed. Short of that, however, obedience to authority had to be
unquestioning.]

Liu: He whose actions are in accord with the orders of the highest receives no
blame. His fellows share in his blessing.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing fate, without fault. Cultivating radiant
satisfaction.

Shaughnessy: There is a command; there is no trouble; blessings fastened to
the split-log.

Cleary (1): If there is an order, there is no fault. The companions attain felicity.

Cleary (2): If there is order, there is no blame. The companions cleave to
blessings.

Wu: Having received the command from the above is without blame. Those of a
like kind will share the blessing.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The purpose of his mind can be carried into effect.
Wilhelm/Baynes: What is willed is done. Blofeld: Those carrying out
commands are obeying the ruler's will. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose moving
indeed. Cleary (2): Because the will is carried out. Wu: His aspirations will
prevail.
12 -- Divorcement --12

Legge: The action of the subject of the line, whose activity is tempered by his
magnetic position, will be good and correct, and issue in success and happiness.
The fourth line is just below the ruler's place, and yielding to the will of Heaven,
or the ruler, he gets his purpose carried out.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A turn for the better occurs. To succeed in creating order and making
progress, however, the man must be given the requisite authority to do the task.
He will fail if he proceeds on his own initiative and judgment.

Wing: It is possible to change the entire situation to one of progress and order. If
you sincerely hear a calling to the task and are in harmony with the cosmos, you
and your associates will benefit. If you simply appoint yourself to the position of
leader, confusion could result.

Editor: Psychologically, the idea here is that when the ego follows the principles
of the Work, or the will of the Self (which amounts to the same thing), other
elements within the psyche ("his companions") are thereby induced to fall into
line.

[Once unity has been achieved] the work of destiny can be commenced,
which is the functioning as a part of God’s evolving Universe which [the
individual], as a spirit, undertook to carry out in the first place... And
how does he work out his destiny? By being himself -- literally. By acting
from within the center of his being, his essential self. Not by acting
according to the dictates of his mind, his emotions or his instincts, but by
using them according to his and their needs.
G. Knight -- The Work of a Modern Occult Fraternity

A. Obey the principles of the Work, and disparate elements will follow
your lead.

B. You are in harmony with your duty/destiny/Work.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows him who brings the distress and
obstruction to a close -- the great man and fortunate. But let him say: "We may
perish! We may perish!" So shall the state of things become firm, as if bound to a
clump of bushy mulberry trees.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Standstill is giving way. Good fortune for the great man.
"What if it should fail? What if it should fail?" In this way he ties it to a cluster of
mulberry shoots.
12 -- Divorcement --12

Blofeld: Stagnation (obstruction) is now coming to an end and fortune favors
the Superior Man, but he must not forget the situation is so dangerous that
collapse may yet occur. Accordingly, he must strengthen himself as mulberry
trees are strengthened by tight bindings.

Liu: Stagnation is coming to an end. The great man has good fortune. "Will it
fail, will it fail?" He ties it to the mulberry shoots.

Ritsema/Karcher: Relinquishing Obstruction. Great People significant. Its
extinction, its extinction. Attaching tending-towards bushy mulberry trees.

Shaughnessy: Beneficent wife; for the great man auspicious; it is lost, it is lost,
tied to a bushy mulberry.

Cleary (1): Ending obstruction, great people are fortunate, but tie themselves to
a tree trunk lest they go to ruin.

Cleary (2): Putting a stop to obstruction, great people are fortunate. But they
still keep destruction in mind.

Wu: Stagnation will soon be brought to a close. This is auspicious for the great
man. Would the nation perish? Would the nation perish? It is like having tied it
to the trunk of a mulberry tree.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune of the great man arises from the
correctness of his position. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is correct and
appropriate. Blofeld: That fortune now favors the Superior Man is indicated by
the suitable position of this line. [A firm line with other firm lines on either
side.] Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correcting appropriate indeed.
Cleary (2): The fortune of great people is when their position is truly
appropriate. Wu: Because his position is proper.

The master said: "He who keeps danger in mind is he who will rest safe
in his seat; he who keeps ruin in mind is he who will preserve his interests
secure; he who sets the danger of disorder before him is he who will maintain
the state of order. Therefore the superior man, when resting in safety, does not
forget the possibility of ruin; and when all is in a state of order, he does not
forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is kept safe, and his states and
all their clans can be preserved. This is according to what the I Ching says: `Let
him say, "Shall I perish? Shall I perish?" So shall this state be firm, as if bound
to a clump of bushy mulberry trees.'"

Legge: The dynamic fifth line in his correct central place brings the distress and
obstruction to a close. Yet he, as ruler, is warned to maintain his caution in two
12 -- Divorcement --12

lines of rhyme: "And let him say, `I die! I die!' -- So to a bushy clump his fortune
he shall tie."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man brings order and progress to the situation. He exhibits cool-
headedness and caution during the transition and maintains contingency plans in
readiness.

Wing: A sweeping change for the better is indicated. Things can improve and
progress. Yet this is the very time to feel cautious and reserved. With such an
attitude your success is doubly insured and a strong foundation is established for
the new times.

Editor: The image in the first line is of the entangled roots of grass plants. The
differences between line one and line five are the differences between roots and
stalks -- one is a cause, the other is an effect. The roots are entangled naturally,
the stalks must be bound together by a conscious act of will: one is a hidden
natural association, the other is an overt willed association.

The affairs of men are often spoiled within
an ace of completion,
by being careful at the end as at the beginning
failure is averted.
Tao Te Ching

A. Be careful during a time of transition.

B. Advance with care out of stagnation.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows the overthrow and removal of the
condition of distress and obstruction. Before this there was that condition.
Hereafter there will be joy.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The standstill comes to an end. First standstill, then good
fortune.

Blofeld: Stagnation (obstruction) has now been overcome and is followed by
great joy.

Liu: Stagnation ends. First there is stagnation, later good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Subverting Obstruction. Beforehand Obstruction,
afterwards rejoicing.
12 -- Divorcement --12

Shaughnessy: Momentary wife; at first negative, later happy.

Cleary (1): Overturning obstruction: first there is obstruction, afterward joy.

Wu: Stagnation is ousted, etc.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: How could it be prolonged? Wilhelm/Baynes: When
standstill comes to an end, it reverses. One should not wish to make it
permanent. Blofeld: In the end it must be overcome. How could it endure
forever? [The process of change is continuous. This is the last line, which is held
to have emerged from the evil symbolized by the hexagram as a whole.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore permitting long-living indeed? Cleary (2):
What can last? Wu: How could it last?

Legge: There is an end to the condition of distress. It was necessary that that
condition should give place to its opposite; and the dynamic line in the topmost
place fitly represents the consequent joy.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Stagnation and disintegration give way to happiness and progress. But they
may not last long.

Wing: The opportunity to change a situation from Stagnation to progress is
at hand. It will not happen of its own accord. A strong and continuing sense of
purpose is necessary to achieve and maintain the greatest possible heights of
success.

Editor: When this line changes the hexagram becomes number forty-five:
Contraction. This suggests that when an impasse is finally broken, the energy
released begins to accumulate for a new cycle of growth.

When one has learned to live with the manifestations of the "not-I" in an
attitude of concrete acceptance, bearing one's seemingly inferior
personal characteristics as a burden rather than identifying with them
and at the same time humbly remaining open to the demands of hitherto
unrealized transpersonal powers, a new phase of psychological
transformation is initiated. The instinctual drives themselves may
change character and consequently the needs for suppressive discipline
or sublimation can be lessened. Much of what formerly seemed evil, or at
least compulsively disturbing, reveals itself as merely primitive and
therefore capable of constructive growth. The instinctual drives thus
transformed and matured cease to be sources of moral danger,
temptation or sin; instead they become the originators of new creative

12 -- Divorcement --12

impulses and possibilities of expression which eventually widen the scope
of the personality and with it the whole life.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. The situation is about to improve. Once the lessons of an impasse are
integrated, one moves on to other things.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTEEN --
UNION OF FORCES

Other titles: Fellowship with Men, The Symbol of Companionship, Lovers,
Beloved Friends, Like-minded persons, Concording People, Gathering Men,
Sameness with People, Universal Brotherhood, Fellowship, Community, United,
Human Association, Union of Men, Integration of Forces, Minor Synthesis,
Cliques, Concordance, To Be In Accord With, Confirmation

Judgment

Legge: Union of Forces appears in the remote districts of the country,
indicating progress and success. It will be advantageous to cross the great stream.
It will be advantageous to maintain the firm correctness of the superior man.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fellowship with Men in the open. Success. It furthers
one to cross the great water. The perseverance of the superior man furthers.

Blofeld: Lovers (friends) in the open -- success! It is advantageous to cross the
great river (or sea). [To make any kind of journey.] The Superior Man will
benefit if he does not slacken his righteous persistence.

Liu: Fellowship of men in the open (countryside). Success. It benefits one to
cross the great water. It benefits the superior man to continue his task.

Ritsema/Karcher: Concording People, tending-towards the countryside.
Growing. Harvesting: wading the Great River. Harvesting: chun tzu, Trial. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of sharing a goal with others. It
emphasizes that finding ways to cooperate with and harmonize people's efforts
is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Gathering men in the wilds; receipt; beneficial to ford the
great river; beneficial for the gentleman to determine.

Cleary (1): Sameness with people in the wilderness is developmental. It is
beneficial to cross great rivers. It is beneficial for a superior person to be upright.

Cleary (1): ... Beneficial for a leader to be correct.

Wu: Fellowship in the open is pervasive, etc. ... It will be advantageous to the
jun zi who perseveres.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

The Image

Legge: The images of heaven and fire form Union of Forces. The superior
man, in accordance with this, distinguishes things according to their kinds and
classes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven together with fire: the image of Fellowship with
Men. Thus the superior man organizes the clans and makes distinctions
between things.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes heaven (the sun) and fire representing a pair
of lovers. The Superior Man treats everything in a manner proper to his kind. [an
analogy (based on the component trigrams) between the sun and fire, which to
some extent are of a kind.]

Liu: Fire goes up to heaven, symbolizing Fellowship with Men. The superior
man organizes his kinship group (party), and sorts them out.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven associating-with fire. Concording People. A
chun tzu uses sorting the clans to mark-off the beings.

Cleary (1): Heaven with fire, sameness with others; superior people
distinguish things in terms of categories and groups.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders distinguish beings in terms of classes and families.

Wu: Heaven above and fire below form Fellowship. The jun zi distinguishes
things by their kinds.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Union of Forces the magnetic line has the central place
of influence and responds to her correlate line in the upper trigram of Strength.
The hexagram takes its name from the upper trigram of Strength lending its
power to the lower trigram of Clarity and Intelligence. This represents the correct
course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and
affect the minds of all under the sky.

Legge: Union of Forces describes a condition which is the opposite of the
preceding hexagram of Divorcement. What was there distress and obstruction
is here a union of forces. But it must be based entirely on the good of the whole,
without any taint of selfishness.

The dynamic line correctly in the fifth place occupies the most important
position, and has for his correlate the magnetic second line, also in her correct
place. The one female line is naturally sought after by all the male lines. The
editors of the K'ang-hsi edition would make the second line respond to all of the
lines of the upper trigram, as being more agreeable to the idea of union.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

The upper trigram is that of Heaven, the lower is of Fire, whose tendency
is to mount upwards. This image suggests the fire ascending, blazing to the sky
and uniting with it. All these ideas are in harmony with the notion of union, but it
must be free of all factionalism, and this is indicated by its being in the remote
districts of the country, where people are unsophisticated and free from the
corrupting effects of urban intrigue. Although a union from such motives can
cope with the greatest difficulties, yet a word of caution is added.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Connections are being made. If you are able to maintain your will, it
is advisable to push for a synthesis.

The Superior Man differentiates and prioritizes; he sorts and evaluates his
options.

This is another image of union -- not the supreme union of hexagram
number eleven, Harmony, but a subordinate union of forces within the psyche
which builds toward an eventual grand alliance. The component trigrams show
the union of Strength and Clarity, suggesting that a certain level of mental
comprehension is involved. To receive the hexagram without changing lines is
often a confirmation of your particular thought -- saying, in effect: "You've made
the connection."

Comprehension (synthesis) involves making distinctions (analysis) -- a
paradoxical process in which one must divide before one can (re)unite. (This is
the solve et coagula of alchemy.) Thus we see the superior man in the Image
creating categories to bring about union -- this is discrimination directed toward
reclassification or rectification. For example, a heterogeneous mixture of
vegetable and flower seeds is made meaningful when one sorts them into their
separate categories. The disparate elements then become coherently "united" --
in I Ching terms, each line obtains its proper correlate as in Hexagram number

(Dialectic) alternates between synthesis and analysis until it has gone
through the entire domain of the intelligible and has arrived at the
principle. Stopping there, for it is only there that it can stop, no longer
busying itself with a multitude of objects since it has arrived at unity, it
contemplates.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

The Chinese name of this hexagram includes the word Jen, which is
apparently a difficult concept, since many philosophers have spent a good deal of
energy in trying to define it:
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

Jen has been variously translated as benevolence, perfect virtue,
goodness, human-heartedness, love, altruism, etc. None of these
expresses all the meanings of the term. It means a particular virtue,
benevolence, and also the general virtue, the basis of all goodness. ...Neo-
Confucianists interpreted it as impartiality, the character of production
and reproduction, consciousness, seeds that generate, the will to grow,
one who forms one body with Heaven and Earth, or "the character of
love and the principle of mind." In modern times, it has even been
equated with ether and electricity...
Wing-Tsit Chan -- A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy

Chu Hsi defines Jen as the "character of the mind" (psyche) and "the principle of
love" (union). Interpreted in this way we are enabled to apprehend the essence of
the word "love," which is union -- becoming one with its object. I have chosen the
title of Union of Forces to emphasize
intra-psychic dynamics which are not immediately obvious in Wilhelm's title of
Fellowship with Men. For example in dealing with questions pertaining to
the Work, the concept of "ego states" or "subpersonalities" is often relevant to the
symbolism of this hexagram:

The human self has been described here as composed of different ego
states separated by boundaries. It has been likened to the structure of
political principalities. From clinical observation we find that ego states
can cooperate for mutual well-being, like allied nations against a
common enemy. An ego state may become split, like East and West
Germany, or fracture into many segments, like the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. Ego states may become cognitively dissonant and hostile to each
other, like Syria and Israel. In fact, the behavior of ego states within an
individual is not unlike that between individuals, and between those
groups of individuals called countries. Why should the behavior of
human "stuff" not be substantially similar at all levels of its
organizations? ...The evidence of self division into ego states is
significant, and an equally tenable hypothesis might be that the states
and boundaries of political entities have been imposed by men on each
other because these represent an externalization of the internal divisions
in their own selves.
J.G. Watkins -- The Therapeutic Self

This hexagram's "shadow side" reveals circumstances preventing the
union of entities or forces, more than those conditions promoting fruitful
affiliation. Note that only the first and fifth lines of the figure depict a positive
synthesis; the first one is minor, and in the case of line 5, union is attained only
after much struggle. Line 2 reveals a clique or faction situation opposed to the
general welfare, and lines 3 and 4 are images of recalcitrant forces unable to
either join or attack the alliance. The sixth line depicts a partial union (probably
the most common outcome in general experience), which the Confucian
commentary nevertheless minimizes. Out of six lines then, only two describe
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

anything like complete fellowship. I have received this hexagram without
changing lines when the context of the question revealed an “incestuous,” clique-
type situation, so not all "fellowship" or Union of Forces is necessarily an ideal
configuration.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows the representative of the Union of
Forces just issuing from his gate. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fellowship with men at the gate. No blame.

Blofeld: The beloved is at the gate -- no harm!

Liu: Fellowship of men outside the gate. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Concording People tending-towards the gate.
Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Gathering men at the gate; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Sameness with people at the gate is blameless.

Wu: Men of fellowship are at the gate. There will be no blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Who will blame him? Wilhelm/Baynes: Going out of the
gate for fellowship with men -- who would find anything to blame in this?
Blofeld: The Superior Man treats everything in a manner proper to his kind.
[Meeting the beloved so publicly cannot give rise to scandal. This implies that
there is no need for secrecy.] Ritsema/Karcher: Issuing-forth-from the gate
Concording People. Furthermore whose fault indeed? Cleary (2): And if you are
the same as people outside the gate, who can blame you? Wu: Men of fellowship
are going outdoors. Who would blame them?

Legge: Line one shows the first attempts at union. It is dynamic, but in the
lowest place, and has no proper correlate above. There is however, no selfishness
in his intent. He has all the world before him with which to unite. Selfish
thoughts concerning union have no place in him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, attempts are made at open friendship.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

Wing: The times are such that a group of people all shares the same needs. They
can come together openly with the same goals in mind. This is the beginning of a
fellowship. Until the interests of the individuals become divergent all will go well.

Editor: Forces begin to assemble for a potential alliance: nothing hinders this.
Psychologically, the image can suggest the beginning of a new cycle or dialectical
process within the psyche.

In the beginning stages people can commit the most horrible sins of
unconsciousness and stupidity without having to pay much for it. Nature
does not take its revenge. But when the work progresses over the years,
even a slight deviation, a hint of the wrong word, or fleeting wrong
thought, can have the worst psychosomatic consequences. It is as though
it became ever more subtle, moving on the razor's edge. Any faux pas is
an abysmal catastrophe, while previously one could tramp kilometers
off the path without one's own unconscious giving one a slap or taking its
revenge in some way.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. In the beginning there is nothing to stop you.

B. Accord, union, success at the outset.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the representative of the Union of
Forces in relation with her kindred. There will be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fellowship with men in the clan. Humiliation.

Blofeld: His beloved (betrothed) is of the same clan as himself -- trouble!

Liu: Fellowship of men in the kinship group (party). Humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Concording People tending-towards ancestry.
Abashment.

Shaughnessy: Gathering men at the ancestral temple; distress.

Cleary (1): Sameness with people in the clan is regrettable.

Wu: Fellowship becomes kinship. There will be humiliation.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Relationship with one's kindred is the path to regret.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The way to humiliation. Blofeld: Choosing a beloved from
a man's own clan is a sure way to unhappiness. [This Chinese belief was so
strongly held that, until recently, even unrelated people of the same surname
could not marry.] Ritsema/Karcher: Abashment tao indeed. Cleary (2): The
road to regret. Wu: This is a way to humiliation.

Legge: Lines two and five are proper correlates, a fact which in this instance
suggests the idea of a partial and limited union. This is blameworthy because
union with only one's kindred implies narrowness of mind.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Because of special privileges and factions, only a limited fellowship is
realized. Regrets and problems result.

Wing: There is a tendency toward elitism and exclusivity. This creates
limitations for everyone in society. Such a situation of egotism and selfish
interests will bring regret.

Editor: The image is one of incestuous exclusivity. The formation of factions,
special interest groups and cliques can only cause harm to the larger psyche or to
society because it excludes the vital give and take necessary for evolution and
eventual synthesis. Sometimes the line can suggest the idea of being caught in a
closed loop or vicious circle -- energy is trapped by limiting beliefs, thus
preventing growth into new realms of being.

When a soul remains for long in this withdrawal and estrangement from
the whole, with never a glance towards the intelligible, it becomes a thing
fragmented, isolated, and weak. Activity lacks concentration. Attention
is tied to particulars. Severed from the whole, the soul clings to the part;
to this one sole thing, buffeted about by a whole world of things, has it
turned and given itself. Adrift now from the whole, it manages even this
particular thing with difficulty...
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. A self-serving alliance portends failure.

B. A recalcitrant complex refuses to integrate.

C. Dogmatic, hidebound perception prevents growth.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject with his arms hidden in the
thick grass, and at the top of a high mound. But for three years he makes no
demonstration.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He hides weapons in the thicket; he climbs the high hill in
front of it. For three years he does not rise up.

Blofeld: Concealing his weapons in the bushes, he climbs his high hill. For three
years he enjoys no happiness. [His cowardice was so great that he dared not
seek home, wife or children for three years. The implication is that boldness at
all costs is required.]

Liu: They hide arms in the bushes. They climb to the summit of a hill. For three
years they do not act.

Ritsema/Karcher: Hiding away arms, tending-towards the thickets. Ascending
one's high mound. Three year's-time not rising.

Shaughnessy: Surrendered appearance in tall grass. Climbing its high peak, for
three years it does not arise.

Cleary (1): Subduing fighters in the bush, climbing up a high hill, even in three
years there will be no flourishing.

Cleary (2): He hides fighters in the bush, etc.

Wu: He conceals weapons in bushes. He moves up to high mounds. He makes no
headway in three years. [He is planning to overwhelm by force those with whom
he disagrees, but he is alone and cannot make a breakthrough.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He hides arms in the thick grass because of the strength of
his opponent. For three years he makes no demonstration--how can he do
anything? Wilhelm/Baynes: Because he had a hard man as opponent--how
could it be done? Blofeld: He conceals his weapons because the enemy is strong-
-but three years without joy! Who would follow such a course?
Ritsema/Karcher: Antagonistic solid indeed. Quieting movement indeed.
Cleary (2): Three years without flourishing is calm activity. Wu: He should be
contented with his lot.

Legge: Line three is dynamic in a dynamic place, but without a proper correlate
in line six. This makes him anxious to unite with line two, but two is devoted to
her proper correlate in line five, of whose strength line three is afraid. Therefore
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

he takes the measures described, but his abstaining so long from action will save
him from misfortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Mistrust ensues. The man conceals his weapons, plans an ambush, but does
not come forth.

Wing: There is a possibility that those involved in the situation have selfish
interests and divergent goals. This is unfortunate, because the ensuing mistrust
of each for the other will grind events to a halt. Unless goals are realigned, no
progress can be made and nothing will come of the situation.

Editor: Wilhelm remarks here that the situation depicts mistrust -- union is
blocked by some divisive element such as doubt or cynicism. Perhaps a
pessimistic attitude is impeding the flow of events. Although the line is not
necessarily always completely negative (note the lack of an appended value
judgment), the image depicts latent forces of an inferior sort blocking the natural
flow of energy or growth. If this is the only changing line we receive hexagram
number 25, Innocence, with a corresponding line depicting undeserved
misfortune. Psychologically interpreted, unconscious complexes could threaten
the Work by refusing to integrate. It is possible that this transcends the ego's
conscious awareness. Blofeld's note does not agree with the general sense of the
line, and may be considered anomalous.

Unfortunately repression does not eliminate the qualities or drives or
keep them from functioning. It merely removes them from ego
awareness; they continue as complexes. By being removed from view
they are also removed from supervision and can thereby continue their
existence unchecked and in a disruptive way.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. A divisive element within the situation is unable to manifest or is
preventing growth.

B. A hidden threat bides its time.

C. Something is blocked.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject mounted on the city wall; but
he does not proceed to make the attack he contemplates. There will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack. Good fortune.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

Blofeld: He climbs his battlemented wall, for he is unable to attack -- good
fortune! [At first sight this case looks rather like that indicated by the third line,
but here cowardice and concealment are replaced by courage modified by
common sense and a desire to do his duty as best he can.]

Liu: They climb on the wall. They are unable to attack. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Riding one's rampart. Nothing controlling attacking.
Significant.

Shaughnessy: Riding astride its wall; you will not succeed in attacking it;
auspicious.

Cleary (2): He mounts the wall but does not succeed in the attack. This is lucky.

Wu: He ascends to the top of his fortress, and is convinced that the offensive
will fail. This will be auspicious. [He ascends to a good vantage point to survey
his surroundings and realizes his blunder. He is quick to correct himself.
Reasoning wins over force.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is mounted on the city wall, but he yields to the right and
doesn't make the attack he contemplated. He recognizes the strait he is in, and
will return to the rule of law. Wilhelm/Baynes: The situation means that he
can do nothing. His good fortune consists in the fact that he gets into trouble and
therefore returns to lawful ways. Blofeld: Being unable to worst the enemy, he
settles down on a fortified wall. His good fortune consists in being able to retain
his sense of what is right even when encountering difficulty. Ritsema/Karcher:
Righteously nothing controlling indeed. One's significance. By-consequence
confining and-also reversing by-consequence indeed. Cleary (2): The luck is
that he will return to order when he reaches the impasse. Wu: Morally he cannot
succeed. He realizes his predicament and reverses his course.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but in a magnetic place, which weakens his
position. He would like to make an attempt on line two, but is afraid to do so.
Stress should be laid on the idea of "yielding to the right."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man mounts his city wall, but is afraid to embark on aggression. The
antagonists consider the difficulties and yield to right and law. Reconciliation is
imminent.

Wing: Your obsession with the attainment of your personal goals will ultimately
cut you off from others. The more you pursue your dream, the farther you drift
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

from your Community. In time, your loneliness will bring you to your senses.
Good fortune.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, a city can symbolize a focus of energy
(perhaps a belief-complex), within which its components live in "fellowship." The
city walls represent the boundaries defining this belief system. Seen from the
outside, the wall is the separation between one condition and another; seen from
the inside it provides both definition and sanctuary for its inhabitants.
(Regarded this way, the differences between lines three and four can be seen as
the differences between the repression and sublimation of a complex.) At any
rate, this line depicts a favorable impasse or restraint of power in the situation at
hand.

Even though we are not responsible for the way we are and feel, we have
to take responsibility for the way we act. Therefore we have to learn to
discipline ourselves. And discipline rests on the ability to act in a manner
that is contrary to our feelings when necessary. This is an eminently
human prerogative as well as a necessity.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. An impasse prevents an unfortunate action.

B. Awareness of an impasse is the first condition necessary for its
resolution.

C. Straddling the fence and able to see both sides of the issue, one is
prevented from joining either faction.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the representative of the Union of
Forces first wailing and crying out, and then laughing. His great army conquers,
and he and his second line correlate meet together.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Men bound in fellowship first weep and lament, but
afterward they laugh. After great struggles they succeed in meeting.

Blofeld: The lovers begin by weeping and wailing, but they finish by laughing,
for the crowd succeeds in bringing them together.

Liu: Fellowship of men. They cry and lament. Later they laugh. After great
battles they have success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Concording People beforehand crying-out sobbing and-also
afterwards laughing. Great legions controlling mutual meeting.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

Shaughnessy: Gathering men at first weeping and wailing, but later laughing;
the great captains succeed in meeting each other.

Cleary (1): In sameness with people, first there is weeping, afterward laughter.
A great general wins, then meets others.

Wu: Men of fellowship first wail and then laugh. The large armed forces meet
after victory.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This arises from his central position and straightforward
character. The meeting secured by his great army intimates that its opponents
have been overcome. Wilhelm/Baynes: The beginning of the men bound in
fellowship is central and straight...they are victorious. Blofeld: This strong line
which is central to the upper trigram indicates that they began by weeping. [A
strong central line is usually auspicious, but not in this case where we are
dealing with something so soft and tender as love.] Fortunately a crowd of
people encountered them and, somehow, the right thing was said to bring them
together again. Ritsema/Karcher: Using centering straightening indeed.
Words mutualize controlling indeed. Cleary (2): It is the middle way. In
meeting with the great general, his words overcome. Wu: They together finally
achieve victory.

From the Great Treatise:

"The Master said on this:
The ways of good men different seem.
This in a public office toils;
That in his home the time beguiles.
One man his lips with silence seals;
Another all his mind reveals.
But when two men are one in heart,
Not iron bolts keep them apart;
The words they in their union use,
Fragrance like orchid plants diffuse."

Legge: Line five is dynamic in a dynamic and central place, and seeks union with
his second-line correlate. However, lines three and four are powerful foes who
oppose this union, and their opposition makes him weep. He finally effects his
purpose by collecting his forces and defeating his opponents.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: After considerable difficulties, the man collects his forces and overcomes
the obstacles to the union of men. Sadness gives way to joy.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13

Wing: The difficulties and obstacles within the situation cause you much
sorrow. If you openly express your distress you will find that you generate similar
expressions from your fellow man. Together you can overcome the difficult time
and there will be much joy in your newfound unity.

Editor: This line changes the hexagram to Number thirty, Clarity. The
corresponding line is almost identical to this one: "Shows its subject as one with
tears flowing in torrents, and groaning in sorrow. There will be good fortune."
The idea is that, in this case at least, union and clarity (comprehension and
enlightenment) are achieved only through a bitter struggle.

To learn, we must not allow ideas to remain exterior to us, but fuse with
them until they become part of our existence. When this is done and our
dispositions correspond, the soul is able to formulate and make use of
them. It comprehends now what it merely contained before.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. Gather your forces and make a connection. Union or clarity is won after
significant effort.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows the representative of the Union of
Forces in the suburbs. There will be no occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fellowship with men in the meadow. No remorse.

Blofeld: Her beloved is in a distant frontier region -- no regret! [In Chinese
history, it often happened that a man was drafted and sent far away to a
frontier region from which he could not be expected to return for many years.
In this case, his beloved (betrothed or wife) has enough wisdom to give up
repining, since the case is a hopeless one. The implication is that we should not
repine.]

Liu: Fellowship of men in the open countryside. No remorse.

Ritsema/Karcher: Concording people tending-towards the suburbs. Without
repenting.

Shaughnessy: Gathering men in the pasture; there is no regret.

Cleary (1): Being the same as people in the countryside, there is no regret.

Cleary (2): Sameness with people in the countryside involves no regret.

Wu: Men of fellowship gather outside of the city. There will be no regret.
13 -- Union of Forces -- 13
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His object has not yet been attained. Wilhelm/Baynes:
The will is not yet satisfied. Blofeld: This is not what is desired. Ritsema/
Karcher: Purpose not-yet acquired indeed. Cleary (2): The aspiration has not
yet been attained. Wu: Their aspirations have not prevailed.

Legge: The union reaches to all within the suburbs, but it is not yet universal.
The ideal of the hexagram is found in the Judgment in which the union of forces
occurs in the open country. In line six the union is only in the suburbs which
surround the city, yet are not quite out in the "open country." This indicates only
a partial success, but there is still no cause for repentance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man achieves fellowship, but only with those nearby. Simply because
mankind has not yet attained universal brotherhood, however, is no ground for
remorse.

Wing: The unity and fellowship that are possible in this position are not
significant in terms of universal needs. However, joining with others, even in a
small way, is not a mistake.

Editor: The union of forces is adequate to meet the current situation, but it
seems to be a compromise at best. Though the circumstances are said to evoke
no remorse, the Confucian commentary leaves no doubt about his assessment of
this position. The Work still has a long way to go to be complete, but since that
seldom happens this side of hyperspace, any increment of integration has to be
better than no progress at all. Blofeld's translation and note seem too specific to
facilitate these wider meanings.

Thus, human ego development is basically conditioned by, and continues
to unfold between, the divisive Yang pole of separateness and the
connecting Yin pole of union. Between these polarities of separation and
encounter -- loss of oneness and the re-establishment of oneness through
meeting -- the sense of identity continues to grow throughout the life of
the individual.

14 -- Wealth -- 14
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FOURTEEN --
WEALTH

Other titles: Possession in Great Measure, The Symbol of Great Possession,
Sovereignty, Great Having, Great Possessing, The Great Possessor, Great Wealth,
Abundance, Having What is Great, "Often means things other than material
possessions or achievement. Count your blessings for they are many." -- D.F.
Hook

Judgment

Legge: Wealth means great progress and success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Possession in Great Measure. Supreme success.

Blofeld: He who possesses much -- supreme success!

Liu: Great Possessions. Great Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Great Possessing, Spring Growing. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of your relation to an overriding concern or
central idea. It emphasizes that organizing all your efforts around this idea is
the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: The Great Possession: Prime receipt.

Cleary (1): In great possession are creation and development.

Cleary (2): Great possession is great success.

Wu: Great Wealth is primordial and pervasive.

The Image

Legge: Fire over Heaven -- the image of Wealth. The superior man represses
evil and nurtures virtue in accordance with the benevolent will of heaven.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fire in heaven above: the image of Possession in Great
Measure. Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good, and thereby
obeys the benevolent will of heaven.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire in the heavens. [When the trigram for
heaven is above, whatever is below may be separated from it; when it is below,
it indicates fusion or intermixture with what is above. The significance here is
that the splendor of a very great man lights up the heavens.] The Superior Man
suppresses those who are evil and upholds the virtuous. Most gladly he accords
with heaven and carries out its commands.

Liu: Fire over heaven symbolizes Great Possessions. The superior man
suppresses evil and honors virtue, and thus follows the will of heaven and waits
upon destiny.

Ritsema/Karcher: Fire located above heaven. Great Possessing. A chun tzu
uses terminating hate to display improvement. A chun tzu uses yielding-to
heaven to relinquish fate.

Cleary (1): Fire is in the sky; great possession. Thus does the superior person
stop evil and promote good, obeying heaven and accepting its order.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders obey nature and accept its order by stopping the bad and
promoting the good.

Wu: Fire above and heaven below form Great Wealth. Thus the jun zi
suppresses the evil and promotes the good; he abides by the will of heaven to
enrich his life.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Wealth shows the magnetic line in the central ruler's
place, and honored by the dynamic lines above and below. The figure is
composed of the trigrams of Strength and Clarity. The central line of Clarity
responds to the central line of Strength, eventuating in timely action. This
indicates great progress and success.

Legge: Wealth means "great havings," and symbolizes a kingdom, family or
individual in a state of prosperity. The danger in such a position arises from the
pride it is likely to engender. Here however, everything is against that: the place
of honor is occupied by a magnetic line, so that the ruler will be humble, and all
the dynamic lines will respond to her with sympathetic allegiance. The ruler's
seat is in the central position of the trigram of Clarity, and hence her strength is
directed by intelligence, and all her actions are
timely, like the seasons of heaven.

Fire above the sky shines far -- symbolizing the vastness of the territory of
wealth. To develop virtue and repress evil is in accordance with the will of
heaven, which has given to all men a nature fitted for goodness.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Cleary (2): All states of being have this essence inherent in them and are indeed
made of this essence, but all states other than that of complete enlightenment are
out of harmony with this essence in some way. Buddhahood is when you accord
with this essence.

Wu: As the sun shines brightly high in the sky, both the good and the bad will be
exposed. The responsibility of the jun zi is to discriminate between them. He acts
in accordance with the nature of goodness (the will of heaven) to enrich his life.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The greatest kind of Wealth accrues from furthering the Work.

The Superior Man manages his forces in accordance with the goals of the
Work.

Wealth is the inverse of the preceding figure, Union of Forces. If the
thirteenth hexagram depicts a process of uniting, the fourteenth might be seen as
the completion of that process. To have one's inner forces correctly united is
indeed Possession in Great Measure, which is the title that Wilhelm gives to
this figure.

It is emphasized in the Image that this Wealth must be administered in
accordance with the "benevolent will of heaven,” which is to say: the principles of
the Work must always guide one's choices if one is not to lose equilibrium and
become pauperized by illusion.

The superior man considers a rich possession of moral principles to be
honor, and peace in his person to be wealth.
Chou Tun-I

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows that there is no approach to what is
injurious, and there is no error. Let there be a realization of the difficulty and
danger of the position, and there will be no error to the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No relationship with what is harmful. There is no blame in
this. If one remains conscious of difficulty, one remains without blame.

Blofeld: Having no contact with evil, he is blameless; therefore, even if he is
involved in trouble, he remains without fault.

Liu: Avoidance of the harmful brings no blame. Awareness of difficulty -- also
no blame. [This line indicates sadness and confusion but also that one can avoid
them by being cautious.]
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Ritsema/Karcher: Without mingling harm. In-no-way faulty. Drudgery by-
consequence without fault.

Shaughnessy: There is no exchanging of harm that is not trouble; if in difficulty
then there will be no trouble.

Cleary (1): If there is no association with what is harmful, one is not
blameworthy. If you struggle, there will be no fault.

Cleary (2): As long as there is none of the harm that comes from association,
this is not blameworthy. If one struggles, there will be no blame.

Wu: His disadvantage is having no association, but it is not an error of his doing.
If he is aware of his difficult position, he will be blameless.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Shows no approach to what is injurious. Wilhelm/
Baynes: If the first line of Possession in Great Measure has no
relationships, this is harmful. Blofeld: This line means that we shall avoid any
intercourse with evil. Ritsema/Karcher: Without mingling harm indeed.
Cleary (2): The absence of harm that comes from association. Wu: His
disadvantage is having no association.

Legge: Line one, though dynamic, is at the lowest part of the figure, and has no
correlate above. No external influences have as yet acted injuriously on him. Let
him do as directed, and no hurtful influence will ever affect him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, no threats have been received and no challenges met. The
man avoids harm by realizing the dangers caused by opulence and exercising
appropriate restraint.

Wing: Although you possess a great deal, you have not yet been challenged in
your position. Therefore, you have made no mistakes. Keep in mind that the
situation is at its beginning and difficulties may lie on the road ahead. With
forewarned awareness you can remain blameless.

Editor: The image suggests a situation of great potential which could be ruined
through bad choices of action. Recognize the difficulty of maintaining your will
under such circumstances. Wilhelm’s version of the Confucian commentary and
Wu’s translations of both line and commentary don’t follow the other translators.
Their interpretations seem anomalous unless the specific situation concurs.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

There is merely a thin borderline between individuation as a conscious
process and the disruption and dissolution of the personality --
breakdown or even psychosis -- which takes place when the unconscious
gains the upper hand. (Hence also the closeness of genius and insanity
and the danger of "short cut” methods of entering the unconscious, such
as drugs.) The outcome of the confrontation with the numinous powers
depends upon the attitude of the ego.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Despite difficulty, stay clear of anything which might threaten the
Work.

B. Be very careful in your choices now.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows a large wagon with its load. In
whatever direction advance is made, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A big wagon for loading. One may undertake something.
No blame.

Blofeld: There are large supply wagons. [Apparently we need not fear failure
through lack of resources.] If there is some desired goal (or destination), setting
out (to attain it) will involve no error.

Liu: Loading the big wagon. Undertaking without blame. [One can expect to
achieve his undertaking and acquire property.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The great chariot used to carry. Possessing directed going.
Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The great cart is used to carry; there is someplace to go; there is
no trouble.

Cleary (1): Using a great car for transport, when there is a place to go there is no
fault.

Cleary (2): Using a large car for transport, there is a place to go, etc.

Wu: To haul in a cart to a certain destination is without fault.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This refers to the virtue accumulated by the subject of the
line, so that he will suffer no loss in the conduct of affairs. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Accumulating in the middle; thus no harm results. Blofeld: Some place where
supplies have been accumulated will escape from danger. Ritsema/Karcher:
Amassing centering, not destroying indeed. Cleary (2): If the load is balanced
you will not fail. Wu: Means to accumulate at the center with no failure.

Legge: The dynamic second line has his proper correlate in the fifth line ruler of
the figure, and will subordinate his strength to his humility.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Accumulated virtues and competent helpers enable the man to assume
great responsibilities. Like a huge wagon ready for loading, he subordinates
strength to humility.

Wing: You not only have tremendous resources to work with, but you also
possess the wherewithal to coordinate these assets and make them work for you.
Such ingenuity will allow you to fearlessly attempt ambitious endeavors.

Editor: A wagon is a "vessel" which contains something as well as a vehicle
which can go somewhere. Thus the image suggests the power to accomplish a
task or reach a goal.

If a man worships the Self only as his true state, his work does not perish,
for whatever he desires that he gets from that Self.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

A. The image favors progress in furthering the Work.

B. A receptive vehicle.

C. An accumulation of virtue permits progress.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows us a feudal prince presenting his offerings
to the Son of Heaven. An inferior man would be unequal to such a duty.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven. A petty man cannot
do this.

Blofeld: A prince may win rewards from his emperor, but this is beyond an
ordinary man's power.

Liu: A duke makes an offering to the emperor. The inferior man is unable to do
this.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Ritsema/Karcher: A prince availing-of Growing, tending- towards heavenly
sonhood. Small People nowhere controlling.

Shaughnessy: The duke uses aromatic grass to the Son of Heaven; the little
man is not capable of it.

Cleary (1): The work of barons serves the son of heaven. Petty people are
incapable of this.

Cleary (2): Impartial action gets through to the ruler. Small people, etc.

Wu: A duke has the honor of dining with the king. The little man is unworthy of
the honor.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: An inferior man in such a position does himself harm.
Wilhelm/Baynes: A petty man harms himself. Blofeld: The little man would
only harm himself in the attempt. [This omen suggests that a great goal can be
won only by someone very powerful or distinguished; others would be well
advised not to attempt it.] Ritsema/Karcher: Small People harmful indeed.
Cleary (2): Small people would be harmed. Wu: This will be unfitting to the
little man.

Legge: Line three is dynamic in a correctly dynamic place. The top line of the
lower trigram is the proper place for a feudal lord. He will humbly serve the
condescending ruler in the fifth place. An inferior man in the same position, but
without the virtue, would give himself airs.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The superior man places his property and talents at the service of the
ruler and the public. The inferior man employs them for his own gain.

Wing: A superior-minded person will place his talents or resources at the
disposal of his leader or his community. Through this type of open generosity he
is benefited, for he is loyally supported in turn. A lesser man cannot do this.

Editor: This line is often received under painful conditions in which a sacrifice
of some kind is demanded. Blofeld and Wu’s versions differ conceptually from
the other translators, and may be considered eccentric unless the matter under
question supports their interpretations.

Whether your task demands abject poverty of you or gives you the
greatest wealth, you must always remember that nothing, absolutely
nothing, ever or anywhere really belongs to you. On the contrary,
everything is God’s property, and from his property you receive

14 -- Wealth -- 14

something only for your actual needs, corresponding to your task. Just
as it's a matter of indifference to a canal whether more or less water
flows through it, because the water doesn't belong to it, you too must
regard everything fate gives you as something that comes to you from
God, and something you must pass on.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

A. Sacrifice your ego-autonomy for the good of the Work. This is
impossible for one who has not advanced beyond his own narrow self-interest.

B. A superior man's meat is an inferior man's poison.

C. A difficult sacrifice is called for.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject keeping his great resources
under restraint. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He makes a difference between himself and his neighbor.
No blame.

Blofeld: Pride is not involved -- no error!

Liu: He distinguishes between himself and his friends. This brings no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: In-no-way one's preponderance. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: It is not his fullness; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Repudiate self-aggrandizement and there is no fault.

Cleary (2): Negating self-inflation, there is no blame.

Wu: He who keeps his strength under restraint will not be humiliated.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His wisdom discriminates clearly what he ought to do.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He is clear, discriminating, and intelligent. Blofeld:
Implies the possession of very great discriminatory powers. [Such as the power
to recognize how very little of our success is really due to our own merits.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness differentiating clearly indeed. Cleary (2):
Because the understanding is clear. Wu: Because he exercises clear
discriminations.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Legge: The strength of line four is tempered by his position in a magnetic place.
Hence he will do no injury to the mild ruler just above him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man discriminates clearly what should be done. He keeps his strength
under control, yields not to competition and envy, and does not injure the mild
ruler.

Wing: Quell your pride and envy and do not attempt to compete with others or
emulate those in power. Give your full attention to the business at hand and you
will avoid mistakes.

Anthony: When we argue, we engage and compete with other people’s inferiors.
We should remain disengaged. Even when we mentally argue with or inwardly
look at the problem, we remain engaged, thinking of ways to deal with their
inferiors. Such looking to the side causes us to deviate from our own direction.

Editor: Wilhelm and Liu both render this line in terms of making a distinction
between oneself and others. The distinction to be made is to see the difference
between the minister in line four and the ruler in line five -- i.e., don't overstep
your authority or aspire above your proper place. The line can also refer to co-
dependence to other people's illusions. You have your own unique path to follow:
you cannot acquiesce to the unenlightened expectations of others without doing
damage to yourself, to them, and to the Work. Choices like this are often
extremely painful. This, however, does not absolve the aspirant from doing what
the Work demands.

Better is one's own dharma, though imperfectly performed, than the
dharma of another well performed. Better is death in the doing of one's
own dharma: the dharma of another is fraught with peril.
Bhagavad-Gita 3:35

A. Follow your own path and let others follow theirs.

B. The situation calls for discrimination and restraint.

C. Differentiate the difference between a superior and an inferior element
in the situation.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the sincerity of its subject reciprocated by
that of all the others represented in the hexagram. Let her display a proper
majesty, and there will be good fortune.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Wilhelm/Baynes: He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified, has good fortune.

Blofeld: His sense of confidence enables him to be sociable and well respected.
A dignified bearing is an asset (literally, good fortune).

Liu: One is confident, sociable, and dignified. Good fortune. [Proud or
aggressive actions will cause trouble. One should not be hasty but wait for the
proper opportunity to act.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Your conforming: mingling thus, impressing thus.
Significant.

Shaughnessy: His return is crossed-like, stooped-like; in the end it is
auspicious.

Cleary (1): The trust is mutual. Power is auspicious.

Cleary (2): ... It is fortunate to be awesome.

Wu: His sincerity matches the confidence the people place in him. His majesty
matches the authority the people accord him. This will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her sincerity is reciprocated by all the others because it
serves to stir and call out what is in their minds. Without a display of proper
majesty they might otherwise feel too easy, and make no preparation to serve her.
Wilhelm/Baynes: By his trustworthiness he kindles the will of others. The
good fortune of his dignity comes from the fact that he acts easily, without
prearrangements. Blofeld: His good fortune in winning the respect of others
enables him to make changes without prior preparation. [This means that we
shall be trusted even if we act unexpectedly.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Trustworthiness uses shooting-forth purpose indeed. Impressing thus, having
significance. Versatility and-also without preparing indeed. Cleary (2):
Aspirations are aroused through faith ... Ease and freedom from preparation.
Wu: His sincerity is to pursue what he sets out to do ... Auspiciousness comes
from simplicity and unpretentiousness.

Legge: Line five symbolizes the ruler. Mild sincerity is good in her, and
influences her ministers and others. But a ruler must not be without an awe-
inspiring majesty.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man and his people are mutually attracted to each other through
unaffected sincerity. Benevolence on his part, however, must be accompanied by
14 -- Wealth -- 14

the proper display of majesty. Otherwise, the people will become insolent and
lose their attitude of service.

Wing: Those whom you may influence are attracted to you through the bond of
sincerity. Thus a truthful relationship exists. If you are overly familiar, however,
attitudes may become too casual to get things accomplished. A dignified
approach brings good fortune.

Editor: Psychologically, this line expresses the idea that the will of the ego to
maintain the letter and spirit of the Work creates a climate of compliance among
the other complexes within the psyche.

Whatever a great man does, that others follow;
Whatever he sets up as a standard, that the world follows.
Bhagavad-Gita 3: 21

A. A good example evokes virtue.

B. The ego is sincere yet firm with the psychic forces under its influence.

C. The image suggests a reciprocity of forces -- you get as good as you give.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject with help accorded to him from
Heaven. There will be good fortune, advantage in every respect.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He is blessed by heaven. Good fortune. Nothing that does
not further.

Blofeld: Those under heaven's protection enjoy good fortune and success in
everything. [The top line of a very favorable hexagram is sometimes taken to
symbolize heaven. Whoever receives (this line) may expect utmost success.]

Liu: One is blessed by heaven. Good fortune. Benefit in everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Originating-from heaven shielding it. Significant, without
not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: From heaven blessing it; auspicious; there is nothing not
beneficial.

Cleary (1): Help from heaven is auspicious, unfailingly beneficial.

Cleary (2): Good fortune that is a blessing from heaven is beneficial to all.
14 -- Wealth -- 14

Wu: With blessings from heaven, there will be good fortune and nothing
disadvantageous.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Good fortune arises from the help of heaven. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The place at the top of Possession in Great Measure has good
fortune. This is because it is blessed by heaven. Blofeld: The great good
fortune presaged by this line is that of being specially protected by heaven.
Ritsema/Karcher: Great Possessing the above: significant. Originating-from
heaven shielding indeed. Cleary (2): A blessing from heaven. Wu: The
blessings come from heaven.

Legge: Even the topmost line takes its character from line five. His strength is
still tempered, and heaven gives its approval.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attains the fullness of blessings. He recognizes the bases for the
favorable state of affairs, remains devoted in his actions, and honors the sage who
exerted the beneficent influence.

Wing: Here lies the potential for great blessings and good fortune. Know how to
keep things in balance; be devoted in your endeavors and openly appreciative to
those who help you. In this way you might expect supreme success.

Editor: Of all the lines and hexagrams in the I Ching, this is one of the most
favorable combinations that one can receive. If it is the only changing line, the
hexagram of Wealth is transformed into the thirty-third hexagram of Great
Power -- a most energetic combination of images.

I cannot define for you what God is. I can only say that my work has
proved empirically that the pattern of God exists in every man, and that
this pattern has at its disposal the greatest of all his energies for
transformation and transfiguration of his natural being.

15 -- Temperance -- 15
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTEEN --
TEMPERANCE

Other titles: Modesty, The Symbol of Humility, Moderation, Humbling,
Respectful/Humble, Yielding/Retiring. 1. Obtaining this hexagram implies that
modesty is needed in our attitude, meaning, to allow ourself to be led without
resistance. – C.K. Anthony. 2. A Humble or modest person is thought of as
having an “empty or unoccupied” mind, meaning a mind without prejudice. –
Chung Wu. 3. Only superior people who practice Tao know where to stop,
disregard what they have and appear to have nothing. – T. Cleary.

Judgment

Legge: Temperance indicates successful progress. Temperance brings a
good issue to the superior man's undertakings.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Modesty creates success. The superior man carries things
through.

Blofeld: Modesty brings success. The Superior Man is able to carry affairs
through to completion.

Liu: Modesty: success. The superior man can continue to work to the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Humbling, Growing. A chun tzu possesses completing.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the necessity to cut through
pride and complication. It emphasizes that keeping your words unpretentious is
the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Modesty: Receipt; the gentleman has an end.

Cleary (1): Humility is developmental. The superior person has a conclusion.

Cleary (2): Humility gets through. A leader has a conclusion.

Wu: Humility is pervasive. The jun zi will have grace in death.

The Image

Legge: A mountain hidden within the earth -- the image of Temperance. The
superior man, in accordance with this, diminishes his excesses to augment his
insufficiencies, thus creating a just balance.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

Wilhelm/Baynes: Within the earth, a mountain: the image of Modesty. Thus
the superior man reduces that which is too much, and augments that which is too
little. He weighs things and makes them equal.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a mountain in the centre of the earth. The
Superior Man takes from where there is too much in order to augment what is too
little. He weighs things and apportions them fairly. [The component trigrams
symbolize a mountain surrounded by flat earth, thus suggesting too much in
one place and too little in others.]

Liu: The mountain within the earth symbolizes modesty. The superior man
reduces the excess and increases the lacking; he weighs and then equalizes all
things.

Ritsema/Karcher: Earth center possessing mountain. Humbling. A chun tzu
uses reducing the numerous to augment the few. A chun tzu uses evaluating
beings to even spreading-out.

Cleary (1): There are mountains in the earth; modesty. Thus does the superior
person decrease the abundant and add to the scarce, assessing things and dealing
impartially.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders assess people and give impartially, by taking from the
abundant and adding to the scarce.

Wu: There is a mountain inside earth; this is Humility. Thus the jun zi takes
excess from the more to enrich the less and measures goods to ensure fair
distribution. [To prepare oneself to accept what is fair among all his fellow men
is the essence of humility.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: It is the way of heaven to dispense its blessings downwards,
and the way of earth to radiate its influence upwards. Both heaven and earth
diminish the full to augment the lowly. Spiritual beings inflict calamity on
the proud and bless the meek, and men resent ostentation and love
temperance. Temperance enlightens an honorable office, and neither will men
ignore it in lowly positions. Thus does the superior man attain his ends.
[Emphasis editor's -- Ritsema/Karcher translate "spiritual beings" [Kuei
Shen] as: "The whole range of imaginal beings both inside and outside the
individual; spiritual powers, gods, demons, ghosts, powers, fetishes.”]

Legge: An essay on temperance rightly follows that on abundant possessions.
The third line, dynamic among five magnetic lines, in the topmost place of the
trigram of Keeping Still, is the ruler of the hexagram. He is the representative
15 -- Temperance -- 15

of Temperance -- strong, but self-effacing. The idea is that temperance is the
way to permanent success.

The Confucian commentary deals generally with the subject of
temperance, showing how it is valued by heaven and earth, by spirits and by men.
The descent of the heavenly influences, and the low position of the earth are both
symbolic of temperance. The heavenly influences are seen in the daily
fluctuations of the sun and moon, and the fertility of the earth correspondingly
waxes and wanes with the seasons.

The Daily Lecture says: "The five yin lines above and below symbolize
the earth; the one yang line in the center is the mountain in the midst of the
earth. The many yin lines represent men's desires; the one yang line represents
the heavenly principle. The superior man, looking at this symbolism,
diminishes the multitude of human desires within him, and increases the single
shoot of the heavenly principle; so does he become grandly just, and can deal
with all things evenly according to the nature of each. In whatever
circumstances or place he is, he will do what is right.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Temperance means maintaining a dynamic/magnetic balance of
forces to attain success.

The Superior Man maintains equilibrium in all that he does.

The most common translation of the title for this hexagram is Modesty,
but I have chosen Temperance as a title more expressive of the ideas in the
Image and Confucian commentary. The words “modesty” and “humility” often
carry a connotation of weakness in western usage, and “temperance,” meaning to
temper or regulate, is more expressive of the dynamic strength of will required to
restrain and modulate the drive to dominate every situation.

The Image shows a mountain hidden beneath the earth--the quiet, invincible
power of sheer will is hidden from view, yet it influences everything. Who
observing such a level surface would know that the bulk of Mt. Everest was buried
beneath it? Temperance means that one's power is hidden, that the
fluctuations of heaven and earth are kept in such dynamic/magnetic balance as to
be invisible to ordinary vision. The temperate person is strong enough to bear
the weight of the world when that is necessary for the Work.

Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic Roman Emperor, was arguably the most
powerful man of his time, yet his temperance and modesty showed him to fulfill
the ideal of the superior man. Only the truly strong can be truly modest.

And let this truth be present to thee in the excitement of anger, that to be
moved by passion is not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they

15 -- Temperance -- 15

are more agreeable to human nature, so also are they more manly; and
he who possesses these qualities possesses strength, nerves and courage,
and not the man who is subject to fits of passion and discontent. For in
the same degree in which a man's mind is nearer to freedom from all
passion, in the same degree also is it nearer to strength.
Marcus Aurelius

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare this hexagram with hexagram number forty-one,
Compensating Sacrifice. What are the similarities between the two figures?
Compare also with hexagram number sixteen, Enthusiasm. What basic
principles of the Work emerge?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows us the superior man who adds temperance
to his temperance. Even the great stream may be crossed with this, and there will
be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A superior man modest about his modesty may cross the
great water. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The Superior Man, ever modest and retiring, fords the great river --
good fortune! [Any journey undertaken at this time will bring good fortune.]

Liu: The superior man is modest in his modesty. It is favorable to cross the great
water. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Humbling, Humbling: chun tzu. Availing-of wading the
Great River. Significant.

Shaughnessy: So modest is the gentleman; herewith ford the great river;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Humble about humility, the superior person thereby crosses great
rivers. This is auspicious.

Cleary (2): Extreme humility. It is fortunate if leaders use this to cross great
rivers.

Wu: Being humble about his humility, the jun zi can make use of this virtue to
cross the big river. It will be auspicious.
15 -- Temperance -- 15
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The superior man who adds temperance to his temperance
is one who nourishes his virtue in lowliness. Wilhelm/Baynes: The superior
man is lowly in order to guard himself well. Blofeld: He shows humility in
disciplining himself. Ritsema/Karcher: Lowliness uses originating-from
herding indeed. Cleary (2): In extreme humility, leaders manage themselves
with lowliness. Wu: The jun zi uses humility for self-discipline.

Legge: A magnetic line at the lowest place in the figure is the fitting symbol of
the superior man adding temperance to his temperance. The phrase "nourishes
his virtue” in the Confucian commentary is literally: "pastures himself.” He is all
temperance -- that is what makes him who he is.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man retains his humility and does not press any claims.
As a result he is free from challenges and does not encounter resistance. Difficult
enterprises can be undertaken successfully.

Wing: If you can carry out your proposed endeavor quietly, competently, and
thoroughly, without obvious announcements of your intentions, you can achieve
even significant aims. With a modest and disciplined attitude, you do not create
resistance or invite challenge.

Editor: Wilhelm translates the Confucian commentary in terms of lowliness as a
technique of self-protection. Blofeld renders it as showing humility in one's self-
discipline. Ritsema/Karcher render the verb MU, Herd, as: “tend cattle; watch
over, superintend; ruler, teacher;” which recalls Legge's rendering of: "pastures
himself.” The idea is to use the discipline of will to keep oneself under control.
The line is conceptually a kind of "shadow” to line one of the following hexagram
of Enthusiasm, which see. Sometimes it can have the meaning of "reserve” or
"reservations,” as in "taking something with a grain of salt.”

The signs of one who is making progress are these: he censures no man,
he praises no man, he blames no man, he accuses no man, he says
nothing about himself as if he were somebody or knew something: when
he is impeded at all or hindered, he blames himself ... he removes all
desire from himself, and transfers aversion only to those things within
his power which are contrary to nature: he employs a moderate
movement towards every thing: whether he is considered foolish or
ignorant, he cares not: and in a word he watches himself as if he were an
enemy and lying in ambush.
Epictetus

A. If you can maintain perspective, an advance is warranted.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

B. A double portion of temperance: preserve your reserve, or your
reservations about the matter at hand.

C. The ego undertakes responsibility for the Work with the full awareness
that it is only the instrument of a higher intelligence within the psyche. This
requires a servant's sense of reserve.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows us temperance that has made itself
recognized. With firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Modesty that comes to expression. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: Modestly crows the cock. Righteous persistence brings good fortune.

Liu: Modesty is expressed. Continuing brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Calling Humbling. Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Calling modesty; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Expressing humility is upright and good.

Cleary (2): Expressing humility is good if correct.

Wu: The subject rolls about humility. With perseverance there will be
auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has the virtue in the core of her heart. Wilhelm/
Baynes: He has it in the depths of his heart. Blofeld: The cry reaches the
depths of our hearts. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering the heart acquiring indeed.
Cleary (2): Good if correct in the sense of attainment of the heart. Wu:
Because it comes from the heart.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, central, and in her proper place. She represents
temperance that has "crowed” -- that is, has proclaimed itself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Modesty is at the core of the man's being and reveals itself in his outward
behavior.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

Wing: By maintaining a careful inner Moderation, your outward actions gain
influence and weight. You will now be entrusted with responsibilities. A
thoroughness in your actions brings good fortune.

Editor: Temperance that "crows” seems to be a contradiction in terms;
nevertheless, the image suggests the expression of temperance in one's behavior.
A certain sacrifice of autonomy is implied.

The greater you are, the more you should behave humbly, and then you
will find favor with the Lord.
Ecclesiasticus 3: 19

A. Submit to the requirements of the time.

B. "Modesty is the best policy."

C. Show a little temperance in your behavior, or maintain your temperate
attitude.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows the superior man of acknowledged merit.
He will maintain his success to the end, and have good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A superior man of modesty and merit carries things to
conclusion. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The Superior Man, exceedingly hard-working yet modest, brings his
affairs to fruition -- good fortune!

Liu: The superior man works in a modest way to conclusion. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Toiling Humbling: chun tzu. Possessing completing
significant.

Shaughnessy: Toiling modesty; the gentleman has an end; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Working with humility, the superior person has a conclusion. This
bodes well.

Cleary (2): Leaders who work and achieve yet are humble have an auspicious
conclusion.

Wu: Working hard toward humility, the jun zi will have grace in death. This will
be auspicious.
15 -- Temperance -- 15
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The myriads of the people will submit to him. Wilhelm/
Baynes: All the people obey him. Blofeld: The people most willingly submit to
him. Ritsema/Karcher: The myriad commoners submitting indeed. Cleary
(2): The people submit to leaders who work and achieve yet are humble. Wu:
Because he has the support of all the people.

The Master said: "He toils with success, but does not boast of it; he
achieves merit, but takes no virtue to himself from it; this is the height of
generous goodness, and speaks of the man who with great merit yet places
himself below others. He wishes his virtue to be more and more respectful, he
who is so modest, carrying his respectfulness to the utmost, will be able to
preserve himself in his position.”

Legge: Line three is dynamic, and occupies his proper place. He is the lord of the
hexagram, to whom all represented by the lines above and below turn.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man disregards his fame and acknowledged merit but toils on
laboriously and unpretentiously. He is supported by all the people in bringing his
works to a successful conclusion.

Wing: With an unwavering commitment and hard work, you gain honor and
fame. Do not allow such recognition to lead you astray or put you in a
compromising position. Maintaining the perseverance that brought you
prominence will win you continued support. You can then bring your work to
completion.

Editor: The key idea here is the notion of inferior elements submitting to a
calmly devoted superior element. The inferior elements acknowledge their
superior and willingly submit to him.

Plans for control of the evil forces that have been loosed in the world,
attempts to compensate the evil- doing by good works or sympathy for
the victims, efforts to safeguard the peace or to effect ideal solutions of
all the material problems involved, can do little to change the nature of
the situation. The real problem, namely, the question of what can be
done for civilization in face of the nonhuman forces arising from the
collective unconscious in thousands or rather millions of individual
persons, will remain untouched. However, if only one human being has
met and solved the problem in himself, he will be a living demonstration
of a solution. Such an individual carries with him the germ of a
renaissance of the spiritual values of mankind.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

15 -- Temperance -- 15

A. The ego fulfills its role by bringing disparate elements (emotions,
desires, appetites, etc.) into willing compliance with the goals of the Work.

B. A strong stance inspires obedience.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows one whose action would be in every way
advantageous, stirring up the more her temperance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Nothing that would not further modesty in movement.

Blofeld: Everything will be propitious for those who cultivate modesty.

Liu: To act with modesty is beneficial toward everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without not Harvesting, demonstrating Humbling.

Shaughnessy: There is nothing not beneficial. False modesty.

Cleary (1): Beneficial to all, extending humility.

Cleary (2): Beneficial to all, the exercise of humility.

Wu: Promoting humility is nothing but advantageous.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In doing this she does not act contrary to the proper rule.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not overstep the rule. Blofeld: This involves no
departure from what is right. Ritsema/Karcher: Not contradicting by-
consequence indeed. Cleary (2): This is the way it is supposed to be. Wu:
Because it violates no principle.

Legge: Line four is magnetic and in her proper place. She is sure to be
successful and prosperous, but being so near the fifth-line ruler she should still
use the greatest precaution. The "proper rule” is the rule proper for her in her
circumstances so near the place of the ruler.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man maintains his modesty in the proper perspective. He does not
avoid his responsibilities, abuse the ruler's confidence, or conceal the
subordinate's merit.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

Wing: Once the balance of true Moderation is reached, it must be continually
maintained. This does not mean simply maintaining the form of Moderation,
but continuing to cultivate equilibrium in your character and a sense of
responsibility toward your society.

Editor: An unambiguous image of temperate action.

Modesty and humility are not signs of an inferiority complex. They are
highly estimable, indeed admirable virtues and not complexes. They
prove that their fortunate possessor is not a presumptuous fool but
knows his limitations, and will therefore never stumble beyond the
bounds of humanity, dazzled and intoxicated by his imagined greatness.
Jung -- Depth Psychology and Self-Knowledge

A. Advance the Work through temperate, well-considered action, without
exceeding your authority.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows one who, without being rich, is able to
employ her neighbors. She may advantageously use the force of arms. All her
movements will be advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor. It is favorable
to attack with force. Nothing that would not further.

Blofeld: In treating his neighbors, he is modest about his wealth. If he now
attacks the rebels, everything will contribute to his success.

Liu: Do not show off your riches to your neighbor. It is beneficial to attack with
force. It is favorable for everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not affluence: using one's neighbor. Harvesting: availing-of
encroaching subjugating. Without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Not wealthy together with his neighbors; beneficial herewith to
invade and attack; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): Not enriching oneself, one shares with the neighbors. It is beneficial
to make an invasion, which will profit all.

Cleary (2): Not rich, employing the neighbors, it is beneficial in invasion and
attack; all will profit.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

Wu: He is capable of influencing his neighbors, despite his lack of wealth. It will
be advantageous to take military actions. [Military actions are advantageous
only if used to quell an insurrection, but certainly not to launch an aggression.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She may use the force of arms to correct those who do not
submit. Wilhelm/Baynes: "It is favorable to attack with force” in order to
chastise the disobedient. Blofeld: Such an attack is warranted if the purpose is
to chastise those who do not submit to virtuous laws. [This is not an invitation
to use force in any circumstances, but only if its use is directed at what is truly
perverse or evil.] Ritsema/Karcher: Chastising, not submitting indeed.
Cleary (2): In the sense of overcoming the unruly. Wu: Because they are taken
against the insurrection.

Legge: Men honor temperance in itself, whether or not it has the power to
command obedience and respect. Hence her neighbors follow the ruler in the
fifth line, though she may not be very rich or powerful. Her temperance need not
prevent her from asserting her rights, even by the force of arms. Any refusal to
submit makes an appeal to force necessary. Even the best and most temperate
ruler bears the sword, and must not bear it in vain.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man acts energetically with the use of arms, when necessary, in
correcting those who do not submit. Even in severity, however, he retains a
considerate demeanor, which attracts devoted followers.

Wing: Despite the mild balance that is reached in Moderation, it may be
necessary to take forceful action to accomplish your aims. This should not be
done with a boastful display of power but with firm, decisive, and objective
action. There will be improvement in whatever you undertake.

Editor: Legge's translation differs from the others, stating that one obtains allies
from a position of poverty or relative weakness. Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all
warn about not touting one's wealth (advantage, strength) to one's neighbors --
using them as allies is not specifically mentioned. On the other hand, Ritsema/
Karcher say: "Not affluence: using one's neighbor...” Implicit is the idea that you
are in a strong position and needn't belabor the point. The "force of arms” is the
use of power, and here we have one able to exercise power through a possible
alliance with others like herself (neighbors are peers). Psychologically, it suggests
an ego able to discipline and unite most of its inner forces in the furtherance of
the Work: one summons up an alliance of power to tame recalcitrant elements
within the psyche. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes #39,
Obstruction (Impasse) the corresponding line of which portrays the arrival of
“friends” (allies), thus reinforcing the concept of obtaining some kind of
assistance in the matter at hand.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

Only a unified personality can experience life, not that personality which
is split up into partial aspects, that bundle of odds and ends which also
calls itself "man."
Jung -- Psychology and Alchemy

A. Do what needs to be done without making a big deal out of it.

B. Image of a proper alliance of forces able to correct the situation without
exceeding the mean. A temperate attitude is not inconsistent with the
maintenance of strict discipline.

C. “The force of arms” = self-discipline. Pull yourself together to
harmonize recalcitrant forces within the psyche.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows us temperance that has made itself
recognized. The subject of it will with advantage put her army in motion, but she
will only punish her own towns and state.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Modesty that comes to expression. It is favorable to set
armies marching to chastise one's own city and one's country.

Blofeld: Modestly crows the cock. Now is the time to set armies marching to
subdue the cities and the countries of the empire.

Liu: Modesty is expressed. It is favorable to use the army to chastise the city and
country.

Ritsema/Karcher: Calling Humbling. Harvesting: availing-of moving legions.
Chastising the capital city.

Shaughnessy: Calling modesty; beneficial herewith to move troops to campaign
against city and state.

Cleary (1): Trumpeting humility, it is profitable to use the army to conquer
one’s land.

Cleary (2): Expressing humility, one profits from military operations attacking
the country.

Wu: The subject rolls about humility. It will be advantageous to use the armies to
chasten the seditious state.
15 -- Temperance -- 15
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: All her aims have not yet been attained. She may employ the
force of arms only to correct her own towns and state. Wilhelm/ Baynes: The
purpose is not yet attained. Blofeld: Because the ruler's will has yet to be carried
out, it is proper to do so. [This omen can be taken to indicate that we can afford
to go forward boldly with our plans, but only if their fruition will tally with the
general good. "The ruler's will” in this case is roughly synonymous with the
public good.] Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose not-yet acquired indeed. Permitting
availing-of moving legions. Chastising the capital city indeed. Cleary (2): The
aspiration has not been attained. Wu: His aspirations have not been fulfilled ...
The purpose is to chasten the seditious state.

Legge: The subject of the magnetic sixth line is outside a game that has been
played out. She will use force, but only within her own sphere and to assert what
is right. She will not be aggressive. Chu Hsi bases all that is said under line six
on its being a magnetic line, so that the temperate ruler is unable even at the
close of the action to accomplish all her objects, and must limit her field even in
appealing to arms.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Even though the man's probity is recognized, his aims are not yet achieved.
True modesty begins by disciplining one's own ego and the character of one's
immediate circle, without being aggressive beyond.

Wing: Your inner development is not yet complete. The time calls for self-
discipline. When difficulties arise, do not place the blame upon others. Once you
begin to take responsibility for your own destiny you can bring order to your
environment.

Editor: The ruler uses force to attain order in both this and the previous line, but
here her influence is confined to immediate objectives. Temperance in this
instance is expressed in her awareness of a lack of wholeness in the matter at
hand, and of her own limitations in being able to effect completion.
Psychologically, to "punish your own towns and state:” is to confine your action
to the proper discipline of inner responses: emotions, drives, temptations, etc.

Better an equable man than a hero, a man master of himself than one
who takes a city.
Proverbs 16: 32

A. Recognize the limitations inherent in the situation and confine your
action to objectives within your own sphere of control.

B. A modest, although incomplete, achievement. Confine your activity to
controlling personal responses.
15 -- Temperance -- 15

C. Don't get carried away with a modest achievement.

D. Set your house in order one step at a time.

16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16
HEXAGRAM NUMBER SIXTEEN --
ENTHUSIASM/ SELF-DECEPTION/ REPOSE

Other titles: The Symbol of Harmonious Joy, Repose, Happiness, Providing-
for/Provision, Excess, Merriment, Self-confidence, Contentment, Harmonize,
Excitement, Intemperance, Self-deception "Repose in the absolute confidence
that the action now being taken is right. Also refers to music." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Enthusiasm indicates that feudal princes may be set up and the army
advantageously mobilized.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Enthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers and to set
armies marching.

Blofeld: Repose profits those engaged in building up the country and sending
forth armies. [This means that perfect certainty as to the rightness of our cause
is of great value under the conditions mentioned. The usual meaning of this
character is "beforehand" or "happiness." In the English translation of
Wilhelm's version, it appears as "enthusiasm." "Repose" was suggested by the
Chinese experts who kindly vetted this manuscript. At first I felt hesitant about
adopting it, until I realized that, where it is used favorably, it must be
understood as the kind of mental repose which follows absolute confidence that
the action now being taken is the right one. In lines one, three and six, however,
it clearly means failure to act when action is essential; in line five, failure to act
owing to incapacity.]

Liu: Happiness. It is of benefit to build up the country (or business), and send
the army forth. [Receivers of this hexagram should be wary of exhibiting
excessive enthusiasm when beginning a new undertaking. If they are not, there
will be misfortune. The hexagram also advises that everything necessary for
advancement should be made ready. Then if an opportunity presents itself, it
should be seized immediately, without hesitation.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Providing-for, Harvesting: installing feudatories to move
legions. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of what is needed to
meet the future. It emphasizes that accumulating strength through foresight
and prudence so things can be fully enjoyed is the adequate way to handle it. To
be in accord with the time, you are told to: provide-for!]

Shaughnessy: Excess: Beneficial to establish a lord and to move troops.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

Cleary (1): Joy. It is advantageous to set up a ruler and mobilize the army.

Wu: Merriment indicates the advantage of establishing principalities and
taking military actions.

The Image

Legge: Thunder exploding out of the Earth -- the image of Enthusiasm. The
ancient kings, in accordance with this, composed their music and honored virtue,
offering it especially to God when they worshipped him at the service of their
ancestors.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder comes resounding out of the earth: the image of
Enthusiasm. Thus the ancient kings made music in order to honor merit, and
offered it with splendor to the Supreme Deity, inviting their ancestors to be
present.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder over the earth. The ancient rulers
venerated heaven's gifts with solemn music and they sacrificed abundantly to the
Supreme Lord of Heaven in order to be worthy of their ancestors.

Liu: Thunder arising from the earth symbolizes Happiness. The ancient kings
composed music to honor virtue, offering it to God and the spirits of their
ancestors.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder issuing-forth-from earth impetuously.
Providing-for. The Earlier Kings used arousing delight to extol actualizing-tao.
Exalting worship's Supreme Above. Using equalizing the grandfather
predecessors. [Actualize-tao: ability to follow the course traced by the
ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which
makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): When thunder emerges the earth stirs: Thus did the kings of yore
make music to honor virtue, offering it in abundance to God, thereby to share it
with their ancestors.

Wu: Thunder breaks out above the earth with a boom; this is Merriment. Thus
the ancient kings used music to praise virtuous accomplishments and made
grand offerings to the Supreme Being to be accompanied by their ancestors.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Enthusiasm shows one dynamic line inspiring responsive
obedience in all the others: devoted obedience takes action. Such obedient action
conforms to natural law and creates order and discipline in the people. The
planets and the seasons follow their natural cycles. The sages similarly obey the
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

laws of their nature and the people acknowledge their regulations and
punishments as just.

Legge: Enthusiasm shows harmony and contentment throughout the
kingdom -- a time when the people rejoice in their sovereign and readily obey
him. At such a time his appointments and any military undertakings would be
hailed and supported. Because he is close to the fifth place of dignity, the
dynamic fourth line is seen as the chief executive officer of the ruler. The ruler
has confidence in him, and all of the magnetic lines yield their obedience.
Obedience is the attribute of the lower trigram which here takes the initiative and
uses Movement, which is the attribute of the upper trigram.

The symbolism of the Image is more obscure than usual. The use of music
at sacrifices is supposed to assist in producing the union between God and his
worshippers as well as the present and past generations.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Delegate authority and gather your forces.

The Superior Man synchronizes his will with the intent of the Self via the
principles of the Work.

Enthusiasm is the reverse of the preceding hexagram of Temperance.
In Temperance we saw the calm strength of a mountain concealed within the
earth. In Enthusiasm we see thunder exploding out of the ground into the sky:
the strength that was formerly tempered and restrained is now released. It is
significant to note that while every line of Temperance is more or less
"favorable,” every line of Enthusiasm is either negative or cautionary -- even
the generally positive fourth line carries a hint of warning about “doubt.”

Negatively, Self-Deception (the passion of True Believers) seems to be
what this hexagram is portraying. The figure often suggests a callow or deluded
buoyancy -- the kind of outlook associated with romantic idealists. In its most
negative aspect, Enthusiasm is Intemperance -- the exact opposite of the
moderation and restraint shown in the preceding hexagram. The behavior of an
untrained Great Dane puppy suddenly bursting into a formal dinner party could
be described as "enthusiasm,” but hardly a desirable form thereof. The lower
trigram of Obedient Devotion has suddenly employed the action and energy of
the upper trigram of Thunderous Shock to express itself. This is inconsistent
with the code of the superior man.

Conversely, in its most positive sense, Enthusiasm suggests the surety of
total self-confidence. Blofeld translates this as Repose, explaining that the name
was suggested to him by his Chinese advisors. We begin to understand this
subtle distinction when we compare the seemingly obscure connection with
music in the Image with a passage from Chuang- tse:
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

He who understands the music of heaven lives in accordance with nature
in his life and takes part in the process of change of things in his death.
In repose, his character is in harmony with the yin principle; in activity,
his movement is in harmony with the yang principle. Therefore he who
understands the music of heaven is not blamed by heaven or criticized by
men ... It is said, "In action he is like heaven. In repose he is like the earth
... Because his mind has found repose, therefore the creation pays
homage to him.”

To understand “the music of heaven” is to attain Repose, which is
another way of describing the tranquility that comes with furthering the intent of
the Self. The only dynamic line in the hexagram is in the minister's place just
below the fifth-line ruler. He has the confidence of his sovereign and his actions
therefore accord with heaven. We can turn to the Stoics to find an illustration of
this idea:

My will is simply that which comes to pass. For I esteem what God wills
better than what I will. To Him will I cleave as His minister and
attendant; having the same movements, the same desires, in a word the
same will as He.
-- Epictetus

Thus we see that the hexagram can describe either one of two opposite
conditions -- the intemperate Enthusiasm of ego-confidence (a synonym for
Self-Deception), or the calm Repose of true SELF-confidence. The fifteenth
and sixteenth hexagrams, each the inverse of the other, represent magnetic and
dynamic aspects of the same general idea: Enthusiasm, when it emanates from
the Self, is just Temperance in action.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject proclaiming her pleasure and
satisfaction. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Enthusiasm that expresses itself brings misfortune.

Blofeld: The crowing of the cock bespeaks repose -- an evil omen! [A sleepy
cockcrow is not likely to bring men leaping from their beds, yet the traditional
role of the cock is to sound the call to renewed action.]

Liu: Happiness that shows itself off brings misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Calling Provision. Pitfall. [Provide(-for)/Provision, YU:
ready, prepared for; prearrange, take precaution, think beforehand; satisfied,
contented, at ease.]
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

Shaughnessy: Calling out in excess; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Trumpeting joy is inauspicious.

Wu: Crowing over merriment will be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her wishes have been satisfied to overflowing. Wilhelm/
Baynes: This leads to the misfortune of having the will obstructed. Blofeld:
The evil mentioned in this passage is that which results from utter exhaustion of
the will-power. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose exhausted, pitfall indeed. Cleary
(2): Trumpeting joy bodes ill when the aspiration reaches an impasse. [The first
yin harmonizes with the fourth yang above and rejoices in this; having no real
qualities in oneself, only aspiring to cleave to others, how can one not come to
an impasse?] Wu: Lacking aspiration will be foreboding.

Legge: Line one is magnetic, with a dynamic correlate in the fourth place. She
may well enjoy the happiness of the time, but unable to contain herself, she
erupts in boastful enthusiasm and calls undue attention to herself. Enthusiasm
has thus been her undoing.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is enthusiastic and boastful.

Wing: Although you may have a harmonious connection with someone in a high
position, it does not necessarily indicate that you are on top of the situation.
Furthermore, if you boast of your advantage, you will surely invite disaster.

Editor: The meaning here can be subtle. Something (a strong emotion or
attitude perhaps) is upsetting one’s equilibrium. In addition to the usual meaning
of “enthusiasm,” this can symbolize any release or loss of energy (even despair,
anguish, depression or grief – “Anti-Enthusiasm,” if you will), which serves to
demolish Repose. Shaughnessy labels it Excess. Wilhelm and Blofeld render
the Confucian commentary in terms of the obstruction or exhaustion of
willpower. Ritsema/Karcher describe a loss of purpose; Cleary and Wu, blocked
aspiration. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram changes to Shock, a
plausible consequence in this case.

But woe unto you that are rich! For ye have received your consolation.
Woe unto you that are full! For ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh
now! For ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke 6: 24-25

16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

A. A false sense of well-being – or, a false sense of despair. Examine the
situation to determine where your conscious outlook or emotional response does
not conform with the goals of the Work.

B. Ego/Self Repose is obstructed by inappropriate belief.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one who is firm as a rock. She sees a
thing without waiting till it has come to pass; with her firm correctness there will
be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: Unmoved as a rock; before the end of day, righteous persistence will
bring good fortune. [Unmoved as a rock because of the repose which results
from absolute confidence in a decision already taken.]

Liu: Firm and stable like a rock. Do not wait a whole day. Continuing brings
good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Chain-mail tending-towards petrification: Not completing
the day. Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Scratched on a rock; not to the end of the day; determination is
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Firm as a rock, not procrastinating, rectitude is good.

Wu: He is upright like a rock. In less time than the passing of the day, he
discriminates the good from the bad. To be persevering is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is shown by the central and correct position of the
line. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because it is central and correct. Blofeld: This is
indicated by the suitable position of this line which is central to the lower
trigram. Ritsema/Karcher: Using centering correcting indeed. Cleary (2):
It is balanced in the right way. Wu: Because he is central and correct.

The Master said: "Does not he who knows the inception of things
possess spirit-like wisdom? The superior man, in his intercourse with the
high, uses no flattery, and, in his intercourse with the low, no coarse
freedom: does not this show that he knows the inception of things? Those
beginnings are the slight stirrings of movement, and the earliest

16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

indications of good fortune or ill. The superior man sees them, and acts
accordingly without waiting for the delay of a single day. As is said in
the I Ching, `He is firm as a rock, and acts without waiting for the delay
of a single day. With firm goodness there will be good fortune.' Firm as a
rock, how should he have to wait a single day to ensure his knowing
those beginnings and his course? The superior man knows the minute
and the manifested; he knows what is weak, and what is strong: he is a
model to ten-thousand."

Legge: The magnetic second line is in her correct central position in the lower
trigram. Quietly and firmly she is able to abide in her place and exercise a far-
seeing discrimination. All is indicative of good fortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is quiet, but firm as a rock, yet sensitive to the first imperceptible
signs of impending changes. He does not delay in taking action.

Wing: To be able to recognize the early signs of a change in fortune is a
tremendous gift. While others may be swept away by compelling rhythms and
fads, you adhere firmly to the underlying principles of your nature and react
appropriately to the demands of the time. Such is the behavior of leaders.

Editor: All translations except Legge and Cleary's render the second sentence in
the imagery of "not waiting for a whole day to pass,” which suggests action
taken on the basis of foresight, premonition or intuition. This line is sometimes
an injunction to follow your common sense -- saying in effect, that an oracle is
unnecessary to proclaim the obvious.

You don't need a weatherman to know
which way the wind blows.
-- Bob Dylan

A. Proper discrimination knows when to act, and when to refrain from
action.

B. Your own intuition already knows the answer to your query.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one looking up for favors, while she
indulges the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction. If she would understand! If she
be late in doing so, there will indeed be occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse.
Hesitation brings remorse.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

Blofeld: To gaze reposefully brings regret; tardy action brings regret. [This
suggests inactivity prolonged beyond reasonable measure.]

Liu: Looking upward leads to remorse. Delay brings regret.

Ritsema/Karcher: Skeptical Providing-for, repenting. Procrastinating
possesses repenting.

Shaughnessy: A bowl's excess; regret; being slow there is regret.

Cleary (1): Looking up to joy, if repentance is tardy, there will be regret.

Cleary (2): Looking up in joy, repent. If too late, there is regret.

Wu: Gazing at merriment will bring regret. Loitering about will bring regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is intimated by the position not being the appropriate
one. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the appropriate one. Blofeld: This is
indicated by the line's unsuitable position. Ritsema/ Karcher: Situation not
appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): Wu: Because his position is improper.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place. She looks upward and
depends upon the ruling line above while she does nothing herself but indulge in
pleasure. Unless she changes her attitude, the auspice is bad.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man looks upward for favors and continues his dependency upon
others. He indulges in visions of pleasure and affluence. Unless he changes
immediately, he will be sorry.

Wing: You have waited complacently for a cue from someone else to motivate
you. Whatever the reasons for your hesitation, whether it is idle pleasure in the
present or simply inertia, you are losing your independence and self-reliance. You
can still save yourself. Move.

Editor: This line is magnetic when the times call for dynamic action, giving us
an image of indolent dependency. Without doing anything, she wants to "have
her cake and eat it too.” Sometimes one receives this line when in a state of
despair: feeling as if abandoned to one's fate by an incomprehensible cosmos.
The idea is that fate isn't going to make the transition for you: you must do it
yourself.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

To those who are self-conceited and vain of their imaginary knowledge of
exterior things, having no real wisdom, nothing can be shown, because
the perverted action of their own minds opposes the harmonious action of
the Universal Mind and repulses it. The spheres of their souls become
narrow and contracted, and cannot expand towards the whole. They
rest self-satisfied, buried in the shadow of their own ignorance, and are
inaccessible to the light of Nature.
Paracelsus -- Philosophia Sagax

A. Stop indulging yourself and do what you know to be correct in the
matter at hand.

B. Your confidence is misplaced.

C. The image suggests weakness and dependency.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows him from whom the harmony and
satisfaction come. Great is the success which he obtains. Let him not allow
suspicions to enter his mind, and thus friends will gather around him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The source of enthusiasm. He achieves great things.
Doubt not. You gather friends around you as a hair clasp gathers the hair.

Blofeld: From repose, great results accrue. Harbor no doubts. Why should it be
harmful to befriend this official? [The meaning of this terse question is not
obvious; but the enquirer may find it apt in the context either of his question or
of subsequent events.]

Liu: The source of happiness. One receives great gain without hesitation. Your
friends are already successful.

Ritsema/Karcher: Antecedent Provision. The great possesses acquiring. No
doubting. Partners join-together suddenly.

Shaughnessy: Really excess; if one greatly has gain, do not doubt; cowries and
shells slander.

Cleary (1): Being the source of joy, there is great gain. Do not doubt.
Companions gather.

Wu: Let merriment have its way. There is much to gain. No doubt about it.
Friends will unite their hairpins.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His aims take effect on a grand scale. Wilhelm/Baynes:
His will is done in great things. Blofeld: The first sentence indicates the fullest
attainment of our will. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose: the great moving indeed.
Cleary (2): The aspiration is carried out greatly. Wu: His aspirations are fully
realized.

Legge: The dynamic subject of line four is the agent to whom the happy
condition is owing, and it is only necessary to caution him to maintain his
confidence in himself and his purpose. His adherents and success will continue.

Anthony: The source of enthusiasm is in believing in our path and its ultimate
success, because it is correct. We gather friends and helpers when this belief is
strong enough that we do not try to convince people or contend with them.
Contending comes from the ego, which secretly disbelieves.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is confident, free of suspicions of others, and sincere in his
dedication. He instills harmony and satisfaction among his associates. People
gather around him in effective cooperation.

Wing: Harmonious times are approaching. It is safe to exhibit your confidence
in the future. Your attitude will attract others to you, who will co-operate in your
endeavors. In this way you can accomplish great deeds.

Editor: As the only dynamic line in the hexagram, line four is considered to be
its ruler. When we note that Legge mentions "harmony and satisfaction" instead
of "enthusiasm," we begin to see the meaning behind Blofeld's title of Repose.
Indeed, his translation of the line begins: "From repose, great results accrue..."
Wilhelm's version gives the idea of consolidating forces "as a hair clasp gathers
the hair." Psychologically interpreted, a process of integration is symbolized. The
line can sometimes be a gentle admonition to have faith in your own unconscious
processes to advance the Work.

The One does not aspire to us, to move around us; we aspire to it, to move
around it. Actually, we always move around it; but we do not always
look. We are like a chorus grouped about a conductor who allow their
attention to be distracted by the audience. If, however, they were to turn
towards their conductor, they would sing as they should and would
really be with him. We are always around The One. If we were not, we
would dissolve and cease to exist. Yet our gaze does not remain fixed
upon the One. When we look at it, we then attain the end of our desires
and find rest.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

A. A powerful force calmly organizes separate elements to effect a
synthesis.

B. Quiet SELF-confidence inspires the allegiance of inner forces,
accumulating energy for transformation.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows one with a chronic complaint, but who
lives on without dying.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Persistently ill, and still does not die.

Blofeld: Illness is presaged, but it will not last long or cause death.

Liu: Long illness, but still living.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: affliction. Persevering, not dying.

Shaughnessy: Determination is illness; if constant you will not die.

Cleary (1): There is a persistent illness, but one never dies.

Cleary (2): Chaste in illness, one never dies.

Wu: It is like having a persistent illness, but not fatal.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She is mounted on a dynamic line in the central position,
and her memories of the past have not yet perished. Wilhelm/Baynes: It rests
upon a hard line. That it nevertheless does not die is due to the fact that the
middle has not yet been passed. Blofeld: Illness is indicated because this
yielding line comes immediately above a firm one. Recovery rather than death is
to be expected because this line is, nevertheless, central to the upper trigram.
Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: affliction. Riding a solid indeed. Persevering, not
dying. Center not-yet extinguished indeed. Cleary (2): Being chaste in illness
means riding on firmness. Never dying means not losing balance. Wu: Because
its position remains central.

Legge: Line five is magnetic in the place of a dynamic ruler, and in danger of
being carried away by the lust of enthusiasm. Her proximity to the powerful
influence below is a source of danger. Hence she is represented as suffering from
a chronic complaint.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is continually complaining. Yet the very struggling against the
daily troubles constitutes his immediate incentive for living.

Wing: Total harmony is obstructed and impossible. Yet the very awareness of
this will keep you from sinking again into chaos and eventual defeat.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant
pressure, which prevents him from breathing freely. However, this pressure has
its advantage – it prevents him from consuming his powers in empty enthusiasm.
Thus constant pressure can actually serve to keep one alive.

Anthony: The situation is difficult and uncomfortable. We are still under the
influence of striving to achieve results or hedging to prevent them. However, our
discomfort is useful in causing us to seek out these attitudes which block our
progress.

Editor: At its most neutral, the image suggests a chronic condition currently not
amenable to being cured. Sometimes this feels like ironic irritation: the oracle
seems to be asking: "When are you ever going to learn?” The ego is clinging to
outmoded ways (the "memories" mentioned in Legge's Confucian commentary),
and is yet unable to fully comprehend the demands of the Work. If this is the only
changing line, the hexagram becomes #45, Gathering Together, with a
corresponding line hinting that the source of our illness may be less-than-pristine
dedication. Cleary (2): “Gathering around the position, there is no blame. If
those who are not loyal remain ever-faithful to their original commitment,
regret vanishes.”

Better is one’s own dharma, though imperfectly performed, than the
dharma of another well performed.
Bhagavad Gita

A. A chronic problem remains unresolved.

B. Nobody’s perfect: do the best you can with what you have.

C. Old illusions obstruct your growth.

Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with darkened mind devoted
to the pleasure and satisfaction of the time. But if she changes her course even
when it may be considered as completed, there will be no error.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

Wilhelm/Baynes: Deluded enthusiasm. But if after completion one changes,
there is no blame.

Blofeld: Madcap repose. Fortunately a change takes place, so no blame is
involved. [Madcap repose implies being tardy to the point of extreme rashness
in the face of approaching danger or of a need to act.]

Liu: Deluded happiness. Change after completion. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dim Providing-for. Accomplishment: possessing denial.
Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Dark excess; if complete perhaps you will be informed; there is
no trouble.

Cleary (1): Oblivious in joy. What comes about has change; there is no blame.

Cleary (2): ... What has come about changes, etc.

Wu: Merriment is obscured. There may be success, but changes are pending.
There will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: How can one in such a condition continue for long?
Wilhelm/Baynes: Deluded enthusiasm in a high place: how could this last?
Blofeld: Since this is a top line, the state of madcap repose cannot possibly last
long. Ritsema/Karcher: Dim Providing-for located above. Wherefore
permitting long-living indeed? Cleary (2): Oblivion in joy is at the top. What
can last? Wu: How can the situation continue for long?

Legge: The magnetic sixth line at the end of the hexagram is all but lost.
The action of the figure is over, and if she postpones changing her evil ways any
longer, there is no hope remaining for her. However, there is still a chance of
safety if she will but change.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is distracted by pleasure and satisfaction. If he changes after the
events of the day have run their course, however, the sober awakening will
prevent future errors.

Wing: The person in this position is lost in the memory of a compelling and
harmonious experience. The time is past, and what is left is empty egotism.
Fortunately, reform is possible. There is an opportunity to move on to a situation
of new growth.
16 -- Enthusiasm/Self-Deception/Repose -- 16

Editor: This line has a similar auspice as that of its (improper) correlate in line
three. Wilhelm's commentary states: "A sober awakening from false enthusiasm
is quite possible and very favorable." Note that “no blame” is mentioned,
suggesting that you are more ignorant than culpable in the situation at hand.

While he is in a state of bondage, that is while lusts and falsities rule, the
man who is subjected by them supposes that he is in a state of freedom;
but it is a gross falsity, for at the very time he is carried along by the
delight of his lusts and of the pleasures derived from them, that is, by the
delight of his loves; and because it is by a delight it appears to him as
free. Everyone thinks himself free while he is being led by some love -- so
long as he follows whithersoever it leads.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

A. Conquer your illusions and change your ways.

B. Illusions are shattered when pursued to their logical conclusions.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER SEVENTEEN --
FOLLOWING

Other titles: According With, Acquiring Followers, Adapting, Adjusting, To
Accord With, To Accompany, Concordance, Conformance to The Work, "Learn to
serve in order to rule. Quit the old ways." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Following indicates successful progress and no error through firm
correctness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Following has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. No
blame.

Blofeld: Following. Sublime success! Righteous persistence brings reward --
no error! [This sublime success comes, of course, only to those who follow what
is right, namely the will of heaven or of those whose own will embodies it.]

Liu: Following. Great success. It is of benefit to continue. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Following. Spring Growing Harvesting Trial.
Without fault. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of being
impelled or drawn into moving forward. It emphasizes that yielding to the
impulse by accepting guidance is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord
with the time, you are told to: follow!]

Shaughnessy: Following: Prime receipt; beneficial to determine; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Following is greatly developmental: it is beneficial if correct; then
there is no fault.

Cleary (2): Following is very successful, etc.

Wu: Following is primordial, pervasive, prosperous, and persevering. There
will be no blame.

The Image

Legge: Thunder in the marsh: the image of Following. The superior man, in
accordance with this, at nightfall enters his house and rests.
17 -- Following -- 17

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder in the middle of the lake: the image of Following.
Thus the superior man at nightfall goes indoors for rest and recuperation.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder rumbling within a swamp! When
darkness falls, the Superior Man goes within and rests peacefully. [The
component trigrams can be read as thunder and marsh, but also as movement
and joy. In the Book of Change, joy is frequently associated with willing
obedience to and glad acceptance of what is right.]

Liu: Thunder in the lake symbolizes Following. In the evening, the superior
man rests and relaxes in his home.

Ritsema/Karcher: Marsh center possessing thunder. Following. A chun tzu
uses turning-to darkening to enter a reposing pause.

Cleary (1): There is thunder in the lake, Following. Thus do superior people
go inside and rest when the sun goes down.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders go in and rest at sundown.

Wu: Thunder in the marsh is the symbol of Following. Thus the jun zi retires
toward the twilight of the day.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Following the dynamic trigram places itself under the
magnetic. We see in them the attributes of Movement and Pleasure. Through
firm correctness all under heaven will be found following at such a time.

Legge: Following comes after Enthusiasm, the symbol of harmony and
satisfaction. When these conditions prevail men are sure to follow. The
hexagram includes the ideas of both following others and being followed by
others. (Emphasis mine, Ed.) The good auspice is due to this flexibility, but in
either instance the following must be guided by a reference to what is correct.
The lower trigram of Movement represents the eldest son, and the upper trigram
of Pleasure represents the youngest daughter. The strong places itself under the
weak -- esteeming others higher than himself, and giving the idea of following.
The union of Movement with Pleasure suggests the same idea.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Following means advancement through willpower.

The Superior Man rests on his inner virtue.
17 -- Following -- 17

In Following, the trigram of Movement "follows" the trigram of
Cheerfulness: independent action subordinates itself and allows itself to be led by
cheerful obedience. In terms of the Work, this symbolizes our willingness to
"follow" or adhere to its principles. Psychologically interpreted, Following
means the compliant subordination of ego-autonomy to the Great Work of
psychic integration.

Blofeld points out that the trigram of Joy, or Cheerfulness is often
associated with "willing obedience to and glad acceptance of what is right."
Hence the cheerful following of the intent of the Self. He explains the role of the
superior man in the Image as: "It is not hard to see the connection between
following and resting peacefully; for, once we have given our allegiance to
others [the Self], we no longer have to worry about what should be done."

At seventy ... Confucius allowed his mind to follow whatever it desired,
yet everything he did was naturally right of itself. His actions no longer
needed a conscious guide. He was acting without effort. This represents
the last stage in the development of the sage.
Fung Yu-Lan -- A Short History of Chinese Philosophy

When received without changing lines this hexagram often takes the
meaning of: "To accord with" -- in such instances the answer is an affirmation to
your query.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows us one changing the object of his pursuit; if
he is firmly correct there will be good fortune. Going beyond his own gate to find
associates, he will achieve merit.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The standard is changing. Perseverance brings good
fortune. To go out of the door in company produces deeds.

Blofeld: Those in power undergo a change -- righteous determination brings
good fortune! Going forth from home and mingling with those outside will
produce tangible results.

Liu: One's position is changing. To continue brings good fortune. Both friends
and business are gained by going out. Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: An office: possessing denial. Trial: significant. Issuing-forth
from the gate, mingling possesses achievement.

Shaughnessy: The office perhaps notifies; determination is auspicious; going
out of the gate to interact has results.
17 -- Following -- 17

Cleary (1): Standards change; it is good to be correct. Going outside and mixing
is effective.

Cleary (2): ... Interaction outside the gate is successful.

Wu: The way of conducting public affairs is subject to change. Perseverance will
bring good fortune. Success can be had by communicating with people from
without.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He will not fail in the method he pursues. Wilhelm/
Baynes: To follow what is correct brings good fortune. One does not lose
oneself. Blofeld: The first sentence presages the good fortune derived from
officials undergoing a change of heart and following what is right. The tangible
results mentioned at the end of the passage imply that we shall not fail.
Ritsema/Karcher: Adhering-to correcting significant indeed. Not letting-go
indeed. Cleary (2): It is good to follow what is right ... In the sense of not losing.
Wu: Because following what is correct is auspicious ... Because his position is not
compromised.

Legge: The dynamic first line is the lord of the lower trigram. The magnetic
lines ought to follow him, but he is beneath them in the lowest place in the figure.
This suggests that he should change his pursuit. Because of his strength and
correct position, he will be fortunate in this. Going beyond his gate for associates
shows public spirit and an absence of selfish motivation.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man changes his objectives. He will succeed if he remains
firm in principle and goes beyond selfish considerations to mingle freely with
those who do not share his feelings, as well as those who do.

Wing: A change is occurring, whether in your own objectives or in the situation
around you. In order to accomplish something you should now communicate
with persons of all persuasions and opinions. Yet remain internally principled
and discerning.

Editor: Psychologically, an inner transformation is taking place. If this is the
only moving line, hexagram number forty-five, Contraction, is created, so a
(possibly unconscious) re-arrangement of attitudes and perceptions is suggested.
To "go beyond one's own gate" implies a need to expand your horizons during a
shift in the balance of forces.

When I reached thirty I looked back on my past. The previous victories
were not due to my having mastered strategy. Perhaps it was natural
ability, or the order of heaven, or that other schools' strategy was

17 -- Following -- 17

inferior. After that I studied morning and evening searching for the
principle, and came to realize the Way of Strategy when I was fifty.
Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. Change your focus, marshal your forces, and seek wider horizons.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows us one who cleaves to the little boy, and
lets go the man of age and experience.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one clings to the little boy, one loses the strong man.

Blofeld: He belongs to (i.e. puts himself at the service of) the boy and thereby
loses the adult. [The implied meaning is that he rejects what is superior and
follows what is inferior.]

Liu: By staying with the boy, you lose the strong man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Tied-to the small son. Letting-go the respectable husband.

Shaughnessy: Tying the little son, losing the senior fellow.

Cleary (1): Involved with the child, one loses the adult.

Wu: She clings to her child, but loses her husband.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He cannot be with the two at the same time. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One cannot be with both at once. Blofeld: He cannot be of service to
both of them. Ritsema/Karcher: Nowhere joining associating indeed. Cleary
(2): One is not with both at once. Wu: Because she cannot have both.

Legge: Line two is magnetic. His proper correlate is the dynamic fifth line, but
he prefers to cling to the line below him, instead of waiting to follow line five.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man surrounds himself with the incompetent and dismisses the
experienced.

Wing: Examine your goals and the standards you have set for yourself. If
they are unworthy, inferior, weak, or nonexistent, you will remain low, and you
will lose contact with productive, competent, worthwhile influences. You are
forced to make a choice.
17 -- Following -- 17

Editor: The content of this line prevents using the usual gender symbolism.
Nevertheless, the message is unambiguous.

Most people learn how to think as very young children, and throughout
their adult lives, they do not think any differently than they did as
children. That is to say, most people use their minds in a manner not
essentially different from the way they did when they were six years old
... It is significant that in Kabbalah, one's normal mode of thinking is
referred to as the "mentality of childhood." ... More advanced modes of
thought and states of consciousness, on the other hand, are referred to as
the "mentality of adulthood."
Aryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation

A. Immature attitudes preclude growth.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows us one who cleaves to the man of age and
experience, and lets go the little boy. Such following will get what it seeks, but it
will be advantageous to adhere to firm correctness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one clings to the strong man, one loses the little boy.
Through following one finds what one seeks. It furthers one to remain
persevering.

Blofeld: He belongs to (i.e. is of service to) the adult and loses the boy. By
following the former, he gains what he desires. It is advisable to make no move
but to remain determined.

Liu: By staying with the strong man, you lose the boy. Through following, one
will gain what one seeks. To continue benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Tied-to the respectable husband. Letting-go the small son.
Following possessing seeking, acquiring. Harvesting: residing in Trial.

Shaughnessy: Tying the senior fellow, losing the little son; in following there is
the seeking to get; beneficial to determine about dwelling.

Cleary (1): Involved with the adult, one loses the child. Following with an aim,
one gains. It is beneficial to abide in rectitude.

Cleary (2): ... It is good to remain correct.

Wu: She clings to her husband, but loses her child. Although she gets what she
asks for, she will be privileged to remain persevering.
17 -- Following -- 17
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: By the decision of his will, he abandons the youth below.
Wilhelm/Baynes: One's will gives up the one below. Blofeld: He is willing to
give up what is inferior. Ritsema/Karcher: Below, purpose stowed-away
indeed. Cleary (2): One’s aspiration leaves the low behind. Wu: Because she
has given up her aspiration to hold on to what is below.

Legge: Line three is magnetic, but follows the dynamic line above it, thus
abandoning the first line. This is just the opposite of the situation of the second
line. It is magnetic, however, and line four is not its proper correlate: hence the
conclusion of the paragraph is equivalent to a caution.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man joins with superior people and parts company with the superficial
and the inferior.

Wing: You will find yourself parting ways with former inferior elements in your
life as you make contact with worthwhile persons or ideals. By firmly following
the superior path you will find what you are looking for, while your strength of
character will greatly benefit.

Editor: The context of this line prevents using the gender symbolism employed
in this book. It is opposite in meaning to line two, and unambiguous.

The divine principle in man, which constitutes him a human being, and
by which he is eminently distinguished from the animals, is not a product
of the earth, nor is it generated by the animal kingdom, but it comes from
God; it is God, and is immortal, because, coming from a divine source, it
cannot be otherwise than divine. Man should therefore live in harmony
with his divine parent, and not in the animal elements of his soul. Man
has an Eternal Father who sent him to reside and gain experience in the
animal principles, but not for the purpose of being absorbed in them.
Paracelsus -- De Fundamento Sapientiae

A. The image suggests a growth in perception. One exchanges an
immature belief or attitude for a mature one.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows us one followed and obtaining
adherents. Though he is firm and correct, there will be evil. If he is sincere
however in his course, and make that evident, into what error will he fall?
17 -- Following -- 17

Wilhelm/Baynes: Following creates success. Perseverance brings misfortune.
To go one's way with sincerity brings clarity. How could there be blame in this?

Blofeld: Following someone with an ulterior motive -- persisting in this course
would bring misfortune. But, if as he goes his way he makes sincerity his beacon,
what harm can come to him?

Liu: Success is gained by following. But to continue brings misfortune. Going
the correct way leads to glory (brightness). How can there be blame?

Ritsema/Karcher: Following possessing catching. Trial: pitfall. Possessing
conformity, locating-in tao uses brightening. Wherefore faulty? [Possessing
conformity: "Inner and outer are in accord; confidence of the spirits has been
captured..."]

Shaughnessy: In following there is a catch; determination is inauspicious.
There is a return on the way; at the end of brightness, what trouble is there?

Cleary (1): Following has gain. Even if right, it is inauspicious. Truthfully
remaining on the path, using understanding, what blame is there?

Cleary (2): Following gains, but it bodes ill even if right. Having faith in the
way, thereby understanding, what fault is there?

Wu: To have a following may be advantageous. Despite perseverance, it will be
foreboding. With confidence in his course, he can explain his intention. What
blame can there be?

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: "He is followed and obtains adherents" -- according to the
idea of the hexagram, this is evil. "He is sincere in his course" -- showing his
intelligence, and leading to achievement. Wilhelm/Baynes: This bodes
misfortune...This brings clear-sighted deeds. Blofeld: Following others with
ulterior motives is surely evil; whereas sincerity along the way produces brilliant
results. Ritsema/Karcher: One's righteousness: pitfall indeed... Brightening
achieving indeed. Cleary (2): When following gains, the meaning is
inauspicious. Having faith in the way, the understanding is successful. Wu: With
confidence in his course, he can be successful.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, and in the place of a minister next to the ruler in
line five. His having adherents will be injurious to the authority of the supreme
ruler, and only sincere loyalty will save him from error and misfortune.
17 -- Following -- 17
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man acquires followers who flatter, scheme, and act subservient to seek
personal gains. There is a chance that he will become dependent on them because
of gratifying associations, which will detract from his authority in his position of
influence. He must see through such adherents and free himself from egotistical
encumbrances.

Wing: Those whom you appear to influence actually have ulterior motives in
their allegiance to you. Look beyond the current flattering situation into your
original principled aim. Strive to act independently.

Editor: The line is a clear warning about being corrupted by the projections of
others. Viewed objectively, the ego is only a temporary personality created for
the purpose of transforming psychic energy – a transitional tool or vessel
emanated into matter by the Self for one brief lifetime. It is only a servant--never
a master. Long dedication to the Work can concentrate power which the ego may
be tempted to use for its own benefit--a dangerous seduction which can only
harm the Work.

By permitting credulous and vulgar admirers to congregate about thee,
there is liability of falling into the error of becoming puffed up with
worldly pride.
Guru Gampopa -- Precepts of the Gurus

A. Don't let power go to your head. Sincerity prevents ego-trips.

B. Beware of elements which would distract you from the Work. That
which seems "reasonable" is often just the voice of a demon: a temptation for the
misuse of power.

C. What worked previously is now obsolete. A new strategy is now
appropriate.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows us the ruler sincere in fostering all that is
excellent. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Sincere in the good. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Confidence is admirable -- good fortune! [ Confidence in the context of
this hexagram implies perfect trust in those we follow.]

Liu: There is confidence in goodness. Good Fortune.
17 -- Following -- 17

Ritsema/Karcher: Conformity tending-towards excellence. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Returning in joy; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Truthfulness in good is auspicious.

Wu: Having confidence in goodness is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His position is correct and in the center. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The place is correct and central. Blofeld: The suitable position of this
line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correctly centering indeed. Cleary (2):
Because the state is correctly balanced. Wu: Because his position is correct and
central.

Legge: Line five is dynamic in his central and correct place, with line two as a
proper correlate. Hence the auspicious symbolism.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The ruler fosters excellence, which brings on good fortune.

Wing: If you sincerely insist upon the very best, the chances are that you will get
it. Set your sights high. Good fortune.

Editor: Wilhelm points out that the ruler in line five "follows" the sage in line
six, who represents the way of heaven -- or, in our terms, the ideals of the Work.
When the "ruler" (psychologically in this case, the ego) follows the way of heaven
(the Work), then his subjects (inner aspects) will follow him, and the kingdom
(psyche) will prosper.

Everything that happens to us, properly understood, leads us back to
ourselves; it is as though there were some unconscious guidance whose
aim it is to deliver us from all ties and all dependence and make us
dependent on ourselves.
Jung -- Letters

A. Your attitude is in accordance with the advancement of the Work.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows us that sincerity held and clung to, yea,
and bound fast. We see the king with it presenting his offerings on the Western
Mountain.
17 -- Following -- 17

Wilhelm/Baynes: He meets with firm allegiance and is still further bound.
The king introduces him to the Western Mountain.

Blofeld: He obtained people's allegiance and his followers clung to him. During
the time he spent on the Western Mountain, the King made sacrifice.

Liu: Deeply involved with one's fellows, one tries to continue. The King offers
the Western Mountain.

Ritsema/Karcher: Grappling, tying-to it. Thereupon adhering holding-fast-to
it. The king availing-of Growing tending- towards the Western mountain.

Shaughnessy: Grabbing and tying him, and thereafter binding him; the king
uses aromatic grass on the western mountain.

Cleary (1): Binding and tying up; the king sacrifices on west mountain.

Cleary (2): In a binding involvement, the king sacrifices on the western
mountain.

Wu: He is constrained and bound in order to follow. May a king make offerings
to the gods of the western mountain.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The idea of the hexagram has reached its extreme
development. Wilhelm/Baynes: At the top it ends. Blofeld: Those above us
have exhausted their merit. Ritsema/Karcher: Exhausting the above indeed.
Cleary (2): This is the upper impasse of involvement. Wu: Because he has
reached the upper limit.

Legge: The concept of Following reaches its highest representation in the
topmost line. The action, directed by the most sincere devotion to what is right,
influences both men and spiritual beings. The Western Mountain is Mt. Khi, at
the foot of which was the original settlement of the house
of Kau in 1325 B.C.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The sage, who is retired, is recalled by the king because of his unique
qualifications. The faithful and effective subject is rewarded.

Wing: You are called upon, by virtue of your wisdom and expertise, to lead
another. You will unquestionably become involved, but you will be rewarded for
your unselfish commitment.
17 -- Following -- 17

Editor: Psychologically, Legge's commentary suggests the idea of devotion and
sacrifice uniting forces in both conscious and unconscious realms of the psyche.
The Confucian commentary suggests that the principle of Following comes to
an end when ego and Self merge. To offer a sacrifice on the peak of the Western
mountain: a high spiritual place where the sun sets (an image of the completed
Work), implies this. Getting this line doesn't mean the Work is literally completed
(it never is in this space-time dimension), but that you have probably integrated
some significant inner complexes. Compare this line with 46:4.

The surrender of the limited purposes of the ego to the much larger goals
of the Self -- goals within which the lesser egoic purposes are in fact
meaningfully encompassed -- does not do away with the sense of
freedom. On the contrary, only by subordinating the limitations of the
ego to the Self do we truly justify our freedom and do we meaningfully
validate our responsibility for our actions and decisions.
S.A. Hoeller -- The Gnostic Jung

A. Devotion to the Work brings unity to the psyche.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER EIGHTEEN --
REPAIR

Other titles: Work On What Has Been Spoiled, The Symbol of Destruction,
Decay, Arresting of Decay, Work after Spoiling, Fixing, Rectifying, Corrupting,
Branch, Degeneration, Misdeeds "Can refer to heredity and psychological
traits.” -- D. F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Successful progress is indicated for those who properly repair what has
been spoiled. It is advantageous to cross the great stream. One should consider
carefully the events three days before the turning point and the tasks remaining
for three days afterward.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Work On What Has Been Spoiled has supreme success.
It furthers one to cross the great water. Before the starting point, three days.
After the starting point, three days.

Blofeld: Decay augurs sublime success and the advantage of crossing the great
river (or sea). [I.e. of going on a journey or of going forward with one's plans.]
What has happened once will surely happen again (literally, "three days before
the commencement; three days after the commencement"). [It would have been
hard to make sense of these words, were it not that the Confucian Commentary
on the Text clearly explains them; hence the liberty I have taken with the Text.]

Liu: Work after spoiling. Great success. It is of benefit to cross the great
water. Before starting, three days. After starting, three days. [This hexagram
implies that, although conditions are bad now, improvement can be expected.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Corrupting, Spring Growing. Harvesting: wading the
Great River. Before seedburst three days, after seedburst three days. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of disorder, perversion and
putrefaction. It emphasizes that letting things rot away so they become obsolete
is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Branch: Prime auspiciousness; receipt. Beneficial to ford the
great river; preceding jia by three days, following jia by three days.

Cleary (1): Correcting degeneration is greatly developmental. It is
beneficial to cross great rivers. Three days before the start, three days after the
start. [The way to correct degeneracy is not in empty tranquility without action;
18 -- Repair -- 18

it is necessary to work in the midst of great danger and difficulty, to act in the
dragon’s pool and the tiger’s lair. Only then can one restore one’s original being,
cultivating it into something indestructible.]

Cleary (2): From degeneration comes great development, etc.

Wu: Misdeeds is great and pervasive. It will be advantageous to cross the big
river. It would be advisable to begin an undertaking three days before Jia and
examine the ongoing progress three days thereafter.

The Image

Legge: The image of wind below the mountain forms Repair. The superior
man, in accordance with this, stimulates the virtue of the people.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wind blows low on the mountain: the image of Decay.
Thus the superior man stirs up the people and strengthens their spirit.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing at the foot of a mountain. The
Superior Man, by stimulating people's hearts, nourishes their virtue.

Liu: Wind blowing around the foot of the mountain symbolizes Work after
Spoiling. The superior man encourages people to cultivate virtue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below mountain possessing wind. Corrupting. A chun tzu
uses rousing the commoners to nurture actualizing-tao. [Actualize-tao:
...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos...
Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): There is wind in the mountains; degeneration. Thus superior
people rouse the people and nurture virtue.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders thus arouse the people to nurture virtue.

Wu: There is wind at the foot of the mountain; this is Misdeeds. Thus the jun zi
arouses the people and nurtures his own virtue.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The dynamic trigram is above, and the magnetic trigram is
below. Pliancy is below, and Stopping above: these suggest troubled conditions
verging on ruin. But Repair brings order to all under heaven, and he who
advances will encounter the business to be done. The end of confusion is the
beginning of order; such is the procedure of heaven.
18 -- Repair -- 18

Legge: Repair means the performance of painful but necessary duties. It
shows a situation in which things are going to ruin, as if through poison or
venomous worms. In order to justify the auspice of progress and success, the
duty of the figure is to rectify this and restore conditions to health. This will
require a major effort, such as crossing the great stream, and the careful
differentiation of the causes of the problem, as well as the measures taken to fix
it. The attribute of the lower trigram is Pliancy, and the upper represents
Stoppage or Arrest. Hence, the feeble pliancy of decadence is stopped cold by the
immovable mountain. The three days before and after the turning point
symbolize the careful attention and differentiation necessary for any rectification
to succeed.

On the Image, Ch'eng-tzu says: "When the wind encounters the mountain,
it is driven back, and the things about are all scattered in disorder; such is the
emblem of the state denoted by Repair." The nourishing of virtue appears
especially in line six -- all the other lines belong to the helping of the people.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Repair means to set your house in order. Analyze your choices
before the renovation and evaluate their consequences afterward.

The Superior Man orders his thoughts and feelings, reforms old attitudes, and
strengthens his will. (Psychologically, to "stimulate the virtue of the people"
(Legge) is to rectify the components of a complex.)

To imagine any truly objective state of perception we must include all that
exists: the entire cosmos. Each differentiation of this, from atom to galaxy, is one
slice out of an infinite whole. As a portion of the entirety, we are always linked
with our ancestors in an infinite web of relationships which includes our family
history, our racial-cultural-historical heritage and Homo sapiens as a species.
Though seldom aware of them, it is useful to remember these links. Emanating
from an unfathomable complexity, their karmically-charged morphogenetic fields
are constantly shaping our lives. It follows that, although we perceive ourselves
as separate from our ancestors, the separation is a subjective experience which is
true only in a temporally limited sense.

Every line of Repair, except two and six, shows a son dealing with the
troubles caused by his father. This reminds us of the biblical curse:

For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me.
Exodus 20: 5

The father archetype has a wide range of meanings: this extends from the
Primal Spirit ("God the Father"), to a prior cause or intent in the psyche which
18 -- Repair -- 18

has engendered a present condition. Psychologically interpreted, it is this latter
reading which usually applies. If a "father" symbolizes the cause, then a "son" is
the effect. If the effect is imperfect, then to rectify it is also to rectify the original
intent.

To a large extent our lives consist of well-intentioned but misguided
choices which create less than perfect consequences. To modify our attitude or
behavior so that it corrects errors in our original intent is to "deal with the
troubles caused by the father."

For example: In a misconceived expression of affection, a parent allows his
child unrestricted access to candy. As a consequence of this choice, the kid's
teeth become rotten, and the only logical way to correct the original error is to
now curtail his intake of sugar. The fact that this new choice will create stress in
the relationship between parent and child is just a consequence of the original
choice and has no bearing at all on what is correct in the situation.

In some situations this hexagram may be interpreted as a response to a
karmic chain of cause and effect:

To harmonize with the Wisdom Teachings, the scripture should read that
the karma of the "father" is visited upon the "child" unto the fourth
incarnation, not generation. The mistakes you made in the last four
incarnations may be visited upon you in the form of karma flowing out of
the heart seed atom in the present incarnation. Thus what you
"fathered," or created, in your last incarnation may be the source
("parent") of your karma today. You are a child of that parent today.
You have inherited from that parent -- the you of the past, not your
physical parents -- all of your characteristics, weaknesses and strengths.
Earlyne Chaney -- The Mystery of Death and Dying

The interpretation of any oracle response can only be as profound as our
minds are prepared to accept. As moderns we find it difficult to empathize with
"ancestor worship," yet properly understood, it can provide useful insights into
the Work. In the unconscious realm all time is immediate, not sequential, and
the Objective Psyche consists of a non- temporal web of forces shading from
personal to universal. This means that if we have a complex engendered in us by
our father, for example, we can reasonably assume that he was passing on what
he received from his own parents. In this way, the unresolved complexes of the
ancestors shape our own personalities: they live in and through us right now,
even if they had their birth in forefathers long forgotten. This is a kind of near-
immortality: individuals may die, but beliefs, attitudes, complexes live as long as
they have receptive vessels to inhabit. (This is probably the engine of karma.) To
the extent that an ancestral chain of causality still motivates our choices, we are
totally responsible for "setting right what has been spoiled by the father."
18 -- Repair -- 18
SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Most people have some level of unfinished business with their parents:
psychologists would have little to do if this weren't true. It can be a healing ritual
to set up an altar to a deceased parent and meditate there on the stresses that still
remain between you. To approach the situation without judgment, to realize
(non-logically) that forces pre-existing you provoked the condition as much as
your parent did, will elicit much insight. Be especially aware of the presence of
the past and the illusion of linear time. (Is it possible somehow to be your own
great-grandfather?) Ancestor “worship” of this sort can be profoundly
therapeutic.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by
his father. If he is an able son, the father will escape the blame of having erred.
The position is perilous, but there will be good fortune in the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. If there is
a son, no blame rests upon the departed father. Danger. In the end good fortune.

Blofeld: Children exist to rectify the mistakes wrought by their fathers; hence
the departed are made free from blame -- trouble ending in good fortune!

Liu: If the mistakes of the father are corrected by the son, no blame. There is
danger, but in the end, good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Managing the father's Corrupting. Possessing son-hood.
Predecessors without fault. Adversity, completing significant.

Shaughnessy: The stem father's branch; there is a son crafty; there is no
trouble; danger; in the end auspicious.

Cleary (1): Correcting the father’s degeneracy; if there is a son, the deceased
father is without blame. Danger, but in the end it turns out well.

Cleary (2): Dealing with the degeneration of the father, if there is a child, the
late father has no blame. It is dangerous but turns out well.

Wu: He attends to the affairs of his father. He is a capable son. His father will be
free from blame. It is a difficult task, but it will be good in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He has entered into the work of his father. Wilhelm/
Baynes: He receives in his thoughts the deceased father. Blofeld: This implies
18 -- Repair -- 18

assuming responsibility for their mistakes. Ritsema/Karcher: Intention
receiving the predecessors indeed. Cleary (2): Consciously taking up after the
late father. Wu: He intends to continue his father’s business.

Legge: Line one is magnetic, with a magnetic correlate in line four -- what can be
done here to remedy the state of decay? But the line is the first of the hexagram,
and the decay is not yet great. By heeding the cautions of the text, he can
succeed. He has entered into the work of his father, and brings it about that his
father is looked on as blameless.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, wrongs have arisen which are not yet deeply rooted and can
be remedied. But reforms are associated with dangers, which should be
understood.

Wing: In order to avoid decay, it is necessary to change a traditional and rigid
structure that is affecting your life. You may feel that this is too radical an
undertaking. It is true that this kind of change is fraught with danger, but if you
are cautious while making the reform you will meet with success and renewed
growth.

Editor: This line doesn't lend itself to use of the usual gender symbolism.
Wilhelm translates the Confucian commentary in terms of receiving the departed
father in one's thoughts; Blofeld renders it as taking responsibility for the father's
errors. Ritsema/Karcher render "adversity” as: “Danger, threatening,
malevolent demon ... It indicates a spirit or ghost that seeks revenge by
inflicting suffering upon the living. Pacifying or exorcizing such a spirit can
have a healing effect.” This can refer to any unresolved stresses creating
instability in the situation. Psychologically, the idea is that new insights modify
old errors. If they are formulated carefully, further error is avoided and one has
created a useful new foundation. Sometimes the line can refer to having
misinterpreted a previous oracle.

Lord Naoshige said, "An ancestor's good or evil can be determined by the
conduct of his descendants." A descendant should act in a way that will
manifest the good in his ancestor and not the bad. This is filial piety.
Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai

A. Rectify a past mistake.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused
by his mother. He should not carry his firm correctness to the utmost.
18 -- Repair -- 18

Wilhelm/Baynes: Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother. One
must not be too persevering.

Blofeld: Assuming responsibility for the mistakes of our mothers cannot be too
serious.

Liu: In correcting the mistakes of the mother, one must not be too persistent.

Ritsema/Karcher: Managing the mother's Corrupting. Not permitting Trial.

Shaughnessy: The stem mother's branch; one may not determine.

Cleary (1): Correcting the degeneracy of the mother, it is improper to be
righteous.

Wu: He attends to the affairs of his mother. He should not be insistent.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In dealing with the troubles caused by his mother he holds
to the course of the due mean. Wilhelm/Baynes: He finds the middle way.
Blofeld: At best a middle course is advisable. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring
centering tao indeed. Cleary (2): attaining balance. Wu: He proceeds with
moderation.

Legge: The fifth line ruler is magnetic, while line two is dynamic. Thus the
symbolism takes the form of a son dealing with the prevailing decay induced by
his mother. But a son must be very gentle in all his dealings with his mother, and
especially so when constrained by a sense of duty to oppose her course.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is gentle in dealing with his mother, even when duty bound to
oppose her. When restoring what has been spoiled by weakness, gradualness is
required.

Wing: You have become aware of past mistakes that must be rectified. Here you
must proceed with great sensitivity, since the changes in your life could hurt
those dear to you.

Editor: In psychological symbolism, a female represents emotional or feeling
components within the psyche. A "mother" then, would be the source of an
emotional attitude which, in the context of this hexagram, needs to be modified
or changed. In correcting outmoded or inappropriate feelings one must proceed
with care because emotional/instinctual forces cannot be altered as quickly as we
can change our minds. (It is a commonplace in psychology that mental insights
18 -- Repair -- 18

mean nothing if the emotions involved refuse to conform.) Often the line can
refer to the proper way of responding to another's sensitive mood or attitude.

As in childhood development, which recapitulates human historical
development in consciousness, the psychic detachment from the mother
towards the father is intimately bound up with the growth of
individuality. Consciousness strives to become separate from the
maternal involvement, and aspires toward the outside world represented
by the father.
Gareth Knight -- A History of White Magic

A. Rectify an emotional response. Control your feelings, but don't crush
them.

B. Be sensitive in the way you handle an emotional situation.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows a son dealing with the troubles
caused by his father. There may be some small occasion for repentance, but there
will not be any great error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. There will
be a little remorse. No great blame.

Blofeld: Making ourselves responsible for the mistakes of our fathers may
involve some regret but not much blame.

Liu: In correcting the mistakes of the father, there is slight remorse. No great
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Managing the father's Corrupting. The small possesses
repenting. Without the great: fault.

Shaughnessy: The stem father's branch; there is a little regret; there is no great
trouble.

Cleary (1): Correcting the degeneracy of the father, there is a little regret but not
much blame.

Wu: He attends to the affairs of his father. There will be small regrets, but no big
error.
18 -- Repair -- 18
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the end there will be no error. Wilhelm/Baynes: In the
end there is no blame. Blofeld: In the end we shall be free from blame.
Ritsema/Karcher: Completing without fault indeed. Cleary (2): In the end
there is no blame. Wu: He will be blameless in the end.

Legge: Line three is dynamic, but not central, so that he might well go to excess
in his efforts. But this tendency is counteracted by his place in the trigram of
Humble Submission. (Pliancy.)

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man proceeds too energetically in correcting past errors. This
results in some discord and distress. But a trifle too much energy is preferable to
a trifle too little, and no great blame will ensue.

Wing: You are anxious to rectify the mistakes of the past and move vigorously
into the future. Your actions may be hasty and you will be judged inconsiderate
by others, but in the end you will not suffer for it.

Editor: The image suggests the normal rectification of an error.

Anyone who has ever been through such a psychic experience knows
what an immense relief this can be, how much more bearable, for
example, it is for a son to conceive the son-father problem no longer on
the plane of individual guilt -- in relation, for example, to his own desire
for his father's death, his aggressions and desires for revenge -- but as a
problem of deliverance from the father, i.e., from a dominant principle of
consciousness, that is no longer adequate for the son: a problem that
concerns all men and has been disclosed in the myths and fairy tales as
the slaying of the reigning old king and the son's accession to his throne.
J. Jacobi -- Complex, Archetype, Symbol

A. Image of an easily rectified mistake.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows a son viewing indulgently the troubles
caused by his father. If he goes forward, he will find cause to regret it.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father. In
continuing one sees humiliation.

Blofeld: Tolerating the mistakes of our fathers would occasion us regret in the
course of time.
18 -- Repair -- 18

Liu: Continuing to tolerate the mistakes of the father brings humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enriching the father's Corrupting. Going: visualizing
abashment.

Shaughnessy: The bathed father's branch; going to see is distressful.

Cleary (1): Forgiving the degeneration of the father; if one goes on, there will be
shame.

Cleary (2): Indulging the degeneration of the father, if you go on you will
experience shame.

Wu: He shows compassion in the affairs of his father. If he attends to them, he
will make error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If he advances he will not succeed. Wilhelm/Baynes: He
goes, but as yet finds nothing. Blofeld: In that case, we should fail to rectify
them. Ritsema/Karcher: Going: not-yet acquiring indeed. Cleary (2): If you
go on you will not attain anything. Wu: He will have nothing to gain by attending
to them.

Legge: Line four is magnetic in a magnetic place, which intensifies passivity.
Hence the caution about going forward.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Indulgence of decay leads to regret.

Wing: The situation has been less than harmonious for quite some time, yet this
condition of discord has been tolerated. Under these circumstances things will
continue to degenerate.

Editor: Line four doesn't lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The image
is one of passive and permissive tolerance of error. To allow things to continue
under these conditions will ensure that they get worse. The line can sometimes
refer to a state of complacent ignorance of the true situation. If your assumptions
are incorrect in the first place, then your query is by definition inappropriate: re-
think the question to discover the error.

Psychic inertia is also evident in our resistance to any form of change in
conditioned patterns, no matter how promising or favorable it may be.
Any psychoanalyst knows from dealing with "resistance" that every basic
psychological change entails a deathlike experience for the ego. New

18 -- Repair -- 18

possibilities produce so much anxiety that the most destructive past
adaptations seem safer and inspire more confidence.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Passive indulgence in an old weakness leads to failure.

B. You think things are OK, but they're not: rectify a past error.

C. "A stitch in time saves nine."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by
his father. He obtains the praise of using the fit instrument for his work.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Setting right what has been spoiled by the father. One meets
with praise.

Blofeld: Assuming responsibility for the mistakes of our fathers will win us
praise.

Liu: Correcting the mistakes of the father leads to recognition.

Ritsema/Karcher: Managing the father's Corrupting. Availing- of praise.

Shaughnessy: The stem father's branch; use a cart.

Cleary (1): Correcting the degeneracy of the father, using praise.

Cleary (2): Dealing with the degeneration of the father, the action is praised.

Wu: He attends to the affairs of his father. He has reputation at his disposal.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is responded to by the second line with all of his virtue.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He receives him in virtue. Blofeld: Because to take them
upon ourselves is a virtue. Ritsema/Karcher: Receiving uses actualizing-tao
indeed. [Actualize-tao: Ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing
process of the cosmos ... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a
being become what it is meant to be.] Cleary (2): Because one takes up after
him with virtue. Wu: He succeeds with virtue.

Legge: The magnetic fifth line is the seat of the ruler, but its proper correlate is
the dynamic second line -- the strong minister to whom the work of the hexagram
is delegated.
18 -- Repair -- 18
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: With the assistance of able helpers, the man reverses the process of decay of
former times. He is praised for it.

Wing: You are in a position to assume the responsibility for a long-needed
reform. Do it. Those around you will be supportive of your efforts and you will be
honored with praise and recognition.

Editor: Line five does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The
dynamic second line deals with feelings (the mother), and the magnetic fifth line
deals with thoughts or conscious attitudes (the father). The Confucian
commentary describes these correlate lines as uniting to attain symmetry.
Ritsema/Karcher translate this as facilitating the unfolding of essence (tao). This
suggests an overall rectification of thoughts and feelings to attain balance. The
other translations emphasize that one obtains recognition and praise for this,
suggesting a major accomplishment in the development of the Work.

Inasmuch as ordering activity and emotional receptivity are felt as
belonging to the masculine and feminine principles respectively, the first
life contacts with father and mother set the basic patterns for the
development of our assertiveness and our feeling. When there are
problems in these areas they must be confronted and consciously re-
examined in terms of these original encounters before a further
development can become possible.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Put some thought into your feelings, or: bring compassion into your
thinking.

B. Rectify your thoughts and feelings: revise a limiting belief.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows us one who does not serve either king or
feudal lord, but in a lofty spirit prefers to attend to his own affairs.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not serve kings and princes, sets himself higher
goals.

Blofeld: He does not serve the King or the nobles -- what he does is even loftier
than that. [In other words, if we directly serve the will of heaven; by doing so
we act as sages who may safely do whatever they feel is worth doing.]

Liu: By not serving kings and princes, one gains higher recognition.
18 -- Repair -- 18

Ritsema/Karcher: Not affairs, kingly feudatories. Honoring highness: one's
affair.

Shaughnessy: Not serving king or lord, but highly elevating his virtue;
inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Not serving kings and lords, one makes one’s concerns loftier.

Wu: He does not engage himself in the affairs of kings or princes. He keeps a
lofty lifestyle of his own.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: But his aim may be a model to others. Wilhelm/Baynes:
Such an attitude may be taken as a model. Blofeld: This indicates that our own
will can be our law. [provided we are acting from the highest motives.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose permitted by-consequence indeed.
Cleary (2): One’s will can serve as a model. Wu: His aspiration will be admired.

Legge: Line six is dynamic, with no proper correlate below. Hence it suggests the
idea of one outside the sphere of action who takes no part in public affairs, but
cultivates himself instead.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not serve his lord, but lets the world go by and cultivates his
own character in solitude. In so doing, however, he creates something valuable
for the future of mankind.

Wing: It is possible for you to transcend the entire situation. You do not have to
deal with the mundane details of specific social problems. Instead, you may
concern yourself with universal goals and personal or spiritual development.
Caution: Viewing the world with a cynical or condescending eye, however, will
distort your growth, so watch your attitudes carefully.

Editor: One of the most important precepts of the Work is a clear recognition
that you can only measure your position and progress against an inner standard.
The expectations and apparent achievements of others count for absolutely
nothing. You aren't running a race with the world, but striving to beat your own
record. One who has taken responsibility for the Work must be prepared to go
where its dictates demand, despite what is considered "normal" or "proper"
according to contemporary standards. Ritsema/ Karcher's translation of the
Confucian commentary ("Purpose permitted by-consequence indeed"), means
that one's determination to go it alone is mandated by a deep inner principle.
That such an idea occurs in the hexagram of Repair suggests bolstering one's
resolve to accept this lonely burden. Blofeld's version of the Confucian
18 -- Repair -- 18

commentary ("This indicates that our own will can be our law") is too easily
perverted, even with his cautionary note.

Indeed the Gnostics knew something, and it was this: that human life
does not fulfill its promise within the structure and establishments of
society, for all of these are at best but shadowy projections of another
and more fundamental reality. No one comes to his true selfhood by
being what society wants him to be nor by doing what it wants him to do.
Family, society, church, trade and profession, political and patriotic
allegiances, as well as moral and ethical rules and commandments are,
in reality, not in the least conducive to the true spiritual welfare of the
human soul. On the contrary, they are more often than not the very
shackles which keep us from our true spiritual destiny.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER NINETEEN --
APPROACH

Other titles: The Symbol of Advance and Arrival, Nearing, Overseeing,
Condescension, Getting Ahead, Promotion, Conduct, Drawing Near, Becoming
Great, The Forest, Advance, Advancing, "Two people advancing together; or a
good influence which hasn't been seen or felt for some time, is approaching." --
D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Approach means successful progress through firm correctness. In the
eighth month there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Approach has supreme success. Perseverance furthers.
When the eighth month comes, there will be misfortune.

Blofeld: Approach. Sublime success! Righteous persistence brings reward.
However, when the eighth month is reached, misfortune will befall. [The eighth
moon of the lunar calendar corresponds approximately to September.]

Liu: Approach. Great Success. It is of benefit to continue. When the eighth
month arrives, then there will be misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Nearing, Spring Growing Harvesting Trial. Culminating
tending-towards the eighth moon: possessing a pitfall. [This hexagram describes
your situation in terms of approaching and being approached. It emphasizes
that acting without immediately expecting to attain what you desire is the
adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: The Forest: Prime receipt; beneficial to determine; arriving at
the eighth month there is inauspiciousness.

Cleary (1): Overseeing is creative and developmental, beneficial if correct. In
the eighth month there is misfortune.

Cleary (2): Overseeing is very successful, beneficial if correct. If you go on
until the eighth month, there will be misfortune. [If you ride on the momentum
of the time and do not know to turn back, at a certain point deterioration will
inevitably set in, after flourishing has reached its climax, and there will surely
be misfortune.]
19 -- Approach -- 19

Wu: Condescension is great, pervasive, and persevering, etc. [Condescension
as used in several judgments has two meanings: to condescend (or to look down
from a higher position) and to press forward with authority.]

Hua-Ching Ni: Advance. It is beneficial to go forward with a positive attitude,
but be mindful of the cyclical nature of things.

The Image

Legge: The earth over a marsh -- the image of Approach. The superior man is
inexhaustible in his instruction and unflagging in his nourishing support of the
people.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The earth above the lake: the image of Approach. Thus the
superior man is inexhaustible in his will to teach, and without limits in his
tolerance and protection of the people.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes land rising above a marsh. The Superior
Man's teaching and his affection for his juniors are inexhaustible. Nothing
hinders him in his care for the people. [The lower component trigram suggests
the nourishment which the Superior Man gives joyfully to others. The upper
trigram symbolizes the great bulk of those who benefit.]

Liu: The earth above the lake symbolizes Approach. The superior man's will
for instruction has no limit. He is boundless in his support and protection of the
people.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh possessing earth. Nearing. A chun tzu uses
teaching to ponder without exhausting. [A chun tzu uses] tolerating to protect the
commoners without delimiting.

Cleary (1): Above the lake there is earth, overseeing. Superior people use
inexhaustibility of education and thought to embrace and protect the people
without bound.

Wu: There is ground above the marsh; this is Condescension. Thus the jun zi
realizes that there is no limit to the ideas of education and there is no boundary in
the protection of people.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Approach we see the dynamic lines gradually increasing
and advancing. The lower trigram is the symbol of Being Pleased, and the upper
of Being Compliant. The strong line is in the central position, and is properly
responded to. It is the way of heaven to bring progress and success through firm
correctness, however the advancing power will decay after no long time.
19 -- Approach -- 19

Legge: Approach suggests the approach of authority -- to inspect, to comfort
or to rule. The figure shows two dynamic lines advancing on the four magnetic
lines above them. Their action will be powerful and successful, but it must be
governed by rectitude and a caution that understands the nature of continuous
change.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Two steps forward are followed by one step backward.

The Superior Man remains true to the Work regardless of fluctuations within
the psyche.

The meaning of Approach is derived from the two dynamic lines
advancing from below to encounter the magnetic lines above. These two are firm
allies, and the action of the superior man in the Image suggests that their ascent
is one of benevolent regard for the welfare of their subordinates -- only the third
line need change for the hexagram to become number eleven, Harmony. We
are reminded of the proper relationship between the ego and the Self -- when
they advance together, the magnetic forces in the rest of the psyche are eventually
transformed.

This hexagram recognizes the inevitably slow progress of the Work
("Rome wasn't built in a day"), and that advances are always followed by retreats.
The point is that if one maintains the will to advance, one can be confident that
the Work is advancing, regardless of appearances.

(Confucius) tried his best, but the issue he left to Ming. Ming is often
translated as Fate, Destiny or Decree. To Confucius, it meant the Decree
of Heaven or Will of Heaven ... Thus to know Ming means to
acknowledge the inevitability of the world as it exists, and so to disregard
one's external success or failure. If we can act in this way, we can, in a
sense, never fail. For if we do our duty that duty through our very act is
morally done, regardless of the external success or failure of our action.
Fung Yu-Lan -- A Short History of Chinese Philosophy

Without changing lines, the hexagram suggests a progressive advance in
the matter at hand. Nature being what it is however, no advance can be sustained
indefinitely and an eventual regression can be expected. (This observation is
such a truism that we must assume it is more than usually applicable to the
current situation.)
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject advancing in company with the
subject of the second line. Through his firm correctness there will be good
19 -- Approach -- 19

fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Joint approach. Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: All approach -- righteous persistence will bring good fortune! [All
approach can be taken to mean that all things desirable are converging upon
us.]

Liu: Approach with sincerity. To continue brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjunction Nearing, Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Prohibited forest; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Sensitive overseeing leads to good results when correct.

Wu: Pressing forward with a companion will be auspicious.

Hua-Ching Ni: Advance impartially. One should start in this manner and
continue in this direction. Good Fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His will is set on doing what is right. Wilhelm/Baynes:
His will is to act correctly. Blofeld: This is because what is willed is carried out
in righteous ways. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose moving, correcting indeed.
Cleary (2): Because the intention and the action are correct. Wu: Because his
aspiration is correct.

Legge: Line one is dynamic in his proper place. The danger is that he may be
more strong than prudent -- hence the caution requiring firm correctness.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man advances with his associates to a higher position. He
must remain more prudent than strong in doing right and not be carried away by
the popular will.

Wing: Begin your endeavors in the company of those who share your
enthusiasm. This will give you the kind of strong support necessary to achieve
your aims. At the same time you should be certain that you are pursuing
worthwhile goals. Continuing in your principles brings good fortune.

Editor: The texts of the first two lines are almost identical. As the only two yang
forces in the hexagram they support and reinforce each other in their advance on
the yin lines. The image suggests an ego-Self accord in the work of pacifying
disparate forces within the psyche. If this is the only changing line, the new
19 -- Approach -- 19

hexagram becomes number seven, Discipline, which reinforces the idea of a
disciplined dynamic advance. In the context of certain questions, the Confucian
commentary here sometimes seems more accessible than the original line.

If you want to go your original way, it is the way you make for yourself,
which is never prescribed, which you do not know in advance, and which
simply comes into being of itself when you put one foot in front of the
other. If you always do the next thing that needs to be done, you will go
most safely and sure-footedly along the path prescribed by your
unconscious.
Jung -- Letters

A. Mutual advancement. Ego and Self are in accord. Advance the Work.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject advancing in company
with the subject of the first line. There will be good fortune; advancing will be in
every way advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Joint approach. Good fortune. Everything furthers.

Blofeld: All approach -- good fortune! Nothing is unfavorable. [All approach
can be taken to mean that all things desirable are converging upon us.]

Liu: To approach with sincerity brings good fortune. It is beneficial for
everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjunction Nearing: significant. Without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Prohibited forest; auspicious; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (2): Sensitive overseeing is good, beneficial all around. [The second yang
is also in the momentum of gradually increasing strength, but at this point it is
best to keep still and not ride on the momentum to try to advance; then it will be
good and beneficial all around.]

Wu: Pressing forward with a companion will be auspicious. Everything will be
advantageous.

Hua-Ching Ni: Impartial advance without prejudice continues...

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is because those to whom the advance is made are not
yet obedient to the ordinances of heaven. Wilhelm/Baynes: One need not yield
19 -- Approach -- 19

to fate. Blofeld: This indicates that there is nevertheless some disobedience.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet yielding-to fate indeed. Cleary (2): This is
addressed to those who are not yet in harmony with the universal order. Wu:
There are still those who do not obey the ordinances of heaven. [Since prosperity
of the yang is considered a good omen and meets the approval of heaven,
presence of the four yin in the yang’s path of advance is indicative of disobeying
the ordinances of heaven.]

Legge: Line two is dynamic, but in a magnetic place. This is counterbalanced by
the central position and the proper correlate in line five.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: People who are not obedient to the ways of heaven are induced to follow the
steadfast man in a high position. The future will be advantageous in every way.

Wing: What you propose to do wins sympathy and support from higher forces.
So correct are your ideals that you can overcome even inherent difficulties. The
future is bright indeed.

Editor: The differences in meaning between lines one and two are extremely
slight in English translation. Cleary’s Buddhist commentary on the line suggests
the idea of controlling the momentum of an otherwise favorable action. (See also
his commentary on the Judgment.) Wu’s note on the Confucian commentary
shows line two in immediate contact with four yin lines, interpreted here as
recalcitrant forces. On another tack, if we take Ritsema/Karcher's version of
"Conjunction Nearing: significant...” literally, we can imagine two possible
approaching syntheses (line 1 and line 2), one of which may be more auspicious
than the other. Only the context of your query can provide a plausible
interpretation of these very different readings.

If Jung's method is used in the analysis, the change initiated by the
conflict proceeds under the guidance of the individual's own unconscious.
The analyst does not assume that he knows the answer to the problem
but sets out with his patient to explore the unconscious and seek the
solution. He is necessary to the proceeding because he has a technique
for interpreting the obscure unconscious material thrown up in the
dreams and fantasies; also, he is needed as a fixed point to which the
patient can cling during the transition, when all values are under
question and all landmarks may disappear.
M. E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. An approaching conjunction of forces (or obvious choices) will
nullify an adverse bias in the situation.

B. An alliance for progress furthers the Work.

19 -- Approach -- 19

C. Ego and Self administer the psyche.

Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one well pleased indeed to advance, but
whose action will be in no way advantageous. If she becomes anxious about it
however, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Comfortable approach. Nothing that would further. If one
is induced to grieve over it, one becomes free of blame.

Blofeld: A willing approach, but there is nowhere towards which it would be
advantageous to set out. Feeling regret on that account involves no error.

Liu: Cheerful approach does not benefit further. If one fears regret, no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sweetness Nearing. Without direction: Harvesting. Already
grieving-over it: Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Sweet forest; there is no place beneficial; having been saddened
by it, there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Presumptuous overseeing is of no benefit. If one is troubled over
this, there is no blame.

Cleary (2): ... but if you trouble over it, there will be no blame.

Wu: Condescending for flaunting purposes has nothing to gain. If he is
concerned of his behavior, he will make no error.

Hua-Ching Ni: Easy advancement. If one abuses one’s position, there will be
trouble in the long run. If this tendency is corrected immediately, there will be no
blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She shows herself well pleased to advance, but her
position is not that appropriate to her. If she become anxious about it her
error will not be continued. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the appropriate
one. A fault that induces grief no longer exists. Blofeld: The foregoing is
indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. However, if we grieve for it, we
shall not be involved in error for long. [At present, there is no goal or
destination towards which it would be profitable to move; however, if we
sincerely regret this, it will not be long before we emerge from the rut.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Fault not long-living
19 -- Approach -- 19

indeed. Cleary (2): Once you trouble over it, blame will not last long. Wu: He is
out of place. His error will be temporary.

Legge: Line three is magnetic, neither central nor in her correct position, and
therefore her action will not be advantageous. Being at the top of the lower
trigram of Pleased Satisfaction, she is well pleased to advance. Anxious reflection
will save her from error.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man gains power, influence, and comfort. There is danger of relation
and carelessness in dealing with others. But if he becomes apprehensive about his
actions, he will not continue in his error and will avoid troubles.

Wing: An easy Promotion is possible now. This might lead to a careless
attitude on your part. There is danger in such overconfidence. If you are quick to
recognize the need for continuous caution, however, you can avoid mistakes that
would otherwise harm you.

Editor: The image depicts a case in which one’s powers are not equal to the
challenge. Ritsema/Karcher translate Without direction: Harvesting as:
“No plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the
situation, do not impose a direction on events.” That is, success demands that
you refrain from action or drop the subject of inquiry. Their rendition of:
Grieving-over it means: “Sorrow, melancholy; mourn; anxious, careworn;
hidden sorrow...heart-sick and anxious.” One can receive this line under
conditions of deep grief, wherein (as in any line of the I Ching), extremely subtle
insights often transcend an exact paraphrase.

Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except
the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
Psalms 127: 1

A. Whether simplistic, overconfident, or just naive, your assumptions in
the matter at hand are incorrect. Do not act on them.

B. Desire for something to be true doesn't make it true. Correct your
viewpoint. If sorrow is involved, accept it as your teacher.

C. Unwarranted overconfidence. Nothing can be done now.

D. There are no free rides -- wake up and serve the Work.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows one advancing in the highest mode.
19 -- Approach -- 19

There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Complete approach. No blame.

Blofeld: A perfect approach -- no error!

Liu: Complete approach brings no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Culmination Nearing. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Arriving at the forest; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Consummate overseeing is blameless. [Being weak yet preserving
rectitude, refining oneself and mastering the mind, thereby awaiting the
newborn positive energy, is called consummate overseeing. Watching over the
quintessential, when the great medicine appears one naturally does not make
the mistake of missing it.]

Cleary (2): Consummate overseeing is impeccable. [In Buddhist terms, this
represents using correct concentration corresponding to correct insight.]

Wu: Condescending at the right place is without blame.

Hua-Ching Ni: Correct advancement. No fault.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to the various appropriateness of the position.
Wilhelm/Baynes: For the place is the appropriate one. Blofeld: This is
indicated by the suitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation
appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): In the right place. Wu: His position is proper.

Legge: Line four, though magnetic, is in her proper place and has for her
correlate the dynamic first line. Hence her advance is in the highest style.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man advances to a high place because of the appropriateness of his
ideas and behavior and the open-mindedness of a person of high rank who draws
men of competence into service.

Wing: Your Promotion is well executed. Regardless of any difficulties you may
encounter in assuming your new position, your behavior is so appropriate that
you can continue successfully on your way.

Editor: The image suggests that the conscious attitude is in accordance with the
19 -- Approach -- 19

aims and goals of the Work. Depending on the context of your query, some kind
of fruition is indicated: something is concluding as fated or willed.

But, O my friend, if this be true, there is great reason to hope that, going
whither I go, when I have come to the end of my journey, I shall attain
that which has been the pursuit of my life. And therefore I go on my way
rejoicing, and not I only, but every other man who believes that his mind
has been made ready and that he is in a manner purified.
Plato -- Phaedo

A. The Work is progressing as it should. It's all coming together now.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the advance of wisdom, such as
befits the great ruler. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wise approach. This is right for a great prince. Good
fortune.

Blofeld: A wise approach suited to a great prince -- good fortune.

Liu: To approach with wisdom is appropriate for a great duke. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Knowledge Nearing. A Great Chief's propriety. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Knowing the forest; the great lord's propriety is auspicious.

Cleary (2): Knowing overseeing, appropriate for a great leader, bodes well.

Wu: Condescending with wisdom befits a great king. There will be good fortune.

Hua-Ching Ni: Wise advancement. This is how the great should proceed. G.F.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: What befits the great ruler means pursuing the course of the
due mean. Wilhelm/Baynes: This means that he should walk in the middle.
Blofeld: This is a way of saying that we must keep to the middle path.
Ritsema/Karcher: Moving the center's designating indeed. Cleary (2): What
is appropriate for a great leader is balance in action. Wu: He rules from the
center.

Legge: Line five is the seat of the ruler. She is magnetic, but because she is
central and has the dynamic second line as her proper correlate, she is the symbol
of a wise sovereign who employs able counsel to advise her.
19 -- Approach -- 19
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The great ruler displays his wisdom in attracting men of ability to direct his
affairs and in providing them freedom of action.

Wing: Your position is one of sovereignty. Here you would be wise to allow
others to execute you plan for you. If you can choose competent helpers and
restrain yourself from interfering in their work, you will achieve the ideal of
true authority.

Editor: There is an intimation here of the Self allowing the ego to look after its
own welfare, as long as action is in accordance with moderation and restraint. A
test situation may be in progress.

From my brother Severus (I learned) to love my kin, and to love truth,
and to love justice... And from him I received the idea of a polity in which
there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal
rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government
which respects most of all the freedom of the governed.
Marcus Aurelius

A. An image of balance.

B. Wisdom walks in the middle.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the advance of honesty and generosity.
There will be good fortune, and no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Greathearted approach. Good fortune. No blame.

Blofeld: A magnanimous approach -- good fortune, no error.

Liu: Benevolent approach brings good fortune. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Magnanimity Nearing. Significant. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Thick forest; auspicious; there is no trouble.

Cleary (2): Attentive overseeing is good and blameless.

Wu: Condescending with honesty is auspicious, etc.

Hua-Ching Ni: Sincere advancing. Good Fortune. No blame.
19 -- Approach -- 19
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is because her will is focused on the first two lines
of the lower trigram. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will is directed inward. Blofeld:
This good fortune arises from concealing our will within our hearts. [This would
seem to mean that, for the present, we should gladly accord with others and
carefully conceal our aims.] Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose located inside indeed.
Cleary (2): The good of attentive overseeing is in the will being within. Wu:
Because his aspiration is directed inward.

Legge: Line six is at the top of the upper trigram of Docility. Although the first
and second lines of the hexagram are not her proper correlates, it is proper for
the yin to seek for the yang, and it is emphatically so in this case.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The sage returns from retirement to teach and help others, who greatly
benefit from his experience.

Wing: The person in this position will allow others to benefit from the wealth of
his experience. Such generosity will bring unaccountable progress to all
concerned. This is a true moment of greatness.

Editor: An "advance of honesty" suggests truth: to be "honest" about something
is to acknowledge its truth. "Generosity" implies the unselfish acceptance of this
truth: perhaps a tolerant concession to a less-than-perfect status quo. Wilhelm
renders the Confucian commentary in the imagery of the will being directed
inward; Blofeld interprets it as magnanimity coupled with a hidden agenda which
is not inconsistent with good will. Ritsema/ Karcher's "Purpose located inside
indeed," reinforces this idea. Tolerance or leniency is definitely implied: Wilhelm
describes a sage, retired from the world, generously lending his wisdom to the
people. Psychologically, the image can suggest that advance in the situation at
hand consists of turning inward for support: the developing ego concentrates on
connecting with the perfect will of the Self.

Since the mind which persuades and that which is persuaded are one in
their basic unity, true persuasion consists in revealing the truth of the
oneness of existence.
Prince Shotoku

A. A charitable forbearance with an imperfect world makes room for the
Work to grow.

B. Ego/Self alignment facilitates profitable interaction with others.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY –
CONTEMPLATION

Other titles: View, The Symbol of Steady Observation, Looking Down,
Observation, Viewing, Looking Up, Observing, Admiration, To Examine, Rulers
and Their Subjects, Introspection, Perception, Contemplation of the Work

Judgment

Legge: Contemplation shows us a worshipper who has purified himself, but
must still present his sacrifice with that dignified sincerity which inspires
reverence.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation. The ablution has been made, but not yet
the offering. Full of trust they look up to him.

Blofeld: Looking down. [This word often means “contemplation" and I have
so translated it when the context so requires.] The ablution has been performed,
but not the sacrifice. Sincerity inspires respect. [This is generally understood to
mean that the first step has been taken or that one has bound oneself to follow a
certain course...but that the main duties are yet to be performed.]

Liu: Observation. The hand-washing ritual is completed, but the sacrifice is
still to come. All done and looked upon with sincerity.

Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing: hand-washing and-also not worshipping.
Possessing conformity, like a presence. [This hexagram describes your situation
in terms of something seen from a distance, out of immediate reach. It
emphasizes that carefully observing and divining the meaning is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Looking Up. Washing the hands but not making offering;
there is a return with head held high.

Cleary (1): Observing, one has washed the hands but not made the offering;
there is sincerity, which is reverent.

Wu: Admiration indicates a worshipper washing his hands in preparation for
the offerings, but not participating in it. He shows sincerity and awe.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

The Image

Legge: The image of earth and wind moving above it form Contemplation.
The ancient kings, in accordance with this, examined the different regions of the
kingdom to see the ways of the people, and set forth their instructions.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wind blows over the earth: the image of
Contemplation. Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,
contemplated the people, and gave them instruction.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing across the earth. The ancient
rulers visited the different regions to keep watch over their people and carefully
instruct them.

Liu: The wind blowing over the earth symbolizes Observation. The ancient
kings visited their territories, observed the people, and gave instruction.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wind moving above earth. Viewing. The Earlier Kings
used inspecting on-all-sides, viewing the commoners to set-up teaching.

Cleary (1): Wind is over the earth, observing. Thus did the kings of yore set up
education after examination of the region and observation of the people.

Cleary (2): Wind travels over the earth – observing. Kings of yore examined
the regions and observed the people to set up education. [In Buddhist terms, the
ancient Buddhas examined the “regions” of possible experience and observed the
people in various states of being, then set up various teachings to accommodate
them, just as the wind travels over the earth reaching everywhere.]

Wu: The wind pervades above the earth; this is Admiration. Thus the
ancient kings inspected various regions of the country, observed the sentiments
of the people, and laid down their instructions.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Observation from above -- from the trigram of Flexibility
surmounting the trigram of Docility. The ruler is in his correct central position,
and thus exhibits his lessons to all below. He has purified himself, but not yet
sacrificed. All beneath look to him and are transformed. When we contemplate
the spirit-like way of heaven, we see how the four seasons proceed without error.
The sages, in accordance with this spirit-like way, laid down their instructions,
and all under heaven yield submission to them.

Legge: The Chinese character from which this hexagram is named is used in the
sense of both seeing and being seen. The theme is the sovereign and his people --
how he shows himself to them, and how they in turn perceive him. The two
dynamic lines at the top belong to the ruler, and the four magnetic lines below
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

represent his subjects. In the Judgment the ruler is portrayed as a worshipper at
the commencement of a sacrifice. He is the great Manifester in line five.

The lower trigram symbolizes earth, with the attribute of Docility; the
upper trigram symbolizes wind, with the attributes of Flexibility and Penetration.
Wind moving above the earth has the widest sweep, and nothing escapes its
influence. The personal influence of the ruler effects much, but the ancient kings
wished to add to that the power of published instructions which were specially
adapted to the character and circumstances of the people.

The spirit-like way of heaven is the invisible order underlying the laws of
nature. [Ed. Note: Ritsema/Karcher use the phrase: "Viewing Heaven's
spirit tao ... The all-wise person uses spirit tao to set-up teaching."
Spirit(s), SHEN: independent spiritual powers that confer intensity on heart
and mind by acting on the soul, KUEI; gods, daimons. Tao: way or path;
ongoing process of being and the course it traces for each specific person or
thing; keyword. The ideogram: go and head, leading and the path it creates.]

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Contemplate your motivations and discern the purity of your intent.
"Put your money where your mouth is.” or "Walk your talk.”

The Superior Man evaluates and rectifies his attitudes.

The "ancient kings” in the Image symbolize the creators of an original
state of perfection -- an archetypal model toward which the superior man aspires.
This idea is common to all mystical traditions, many of which depict this state in
the image of an ideal or prototypical man. Here is a summary of the Gnostic
conception:

Not only the body but also the "soul" is a product of the cosmic powers,
which shaped the body in the image of the divine Primal (or Archetypal)
Man and animated it with their own psychical forces: these are the
appetites and passions of natural man, each of which stems from and
corresponds to one of the cosmic spheres [i.e., planets] and all of which
together make up the astral soul of man, his "psyche."
H. Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion

In the Kabbalah, the template of this archetypal man (named Adam
Kadmon) exists in each of the four realms of consciousness corresponding to
intuition, intellect, emotion and sensation, and "he" is perceived as androgynous
in all of these worlds except the last -- the "sensation” world of our physical
spacetime reality.

The Adam of these first three worlds was androgynous. The Adam of the
fourth world is the Adam of the expulsion, the Adam of flesh traversing

20 -- Contemplation -- 20

the desert of his exile, and the Adam capable of reproducing himself now
that he is no longer androgynous.
C. Ponce -- Kabbalah

Considering that androgyny is one of the symbols used in the Western
Mystery Tradition to depict the correct union of male and female forces within
the psyche, we quickly recognize that the properly matched male and female
correlate lines in the I Ching are a Chinese depiction of the identical concept.
Note that the messages of the following three quotations are in complete accord
with the goal of the Work as outlined in the I Ching:

Somewhere there is an Adam within each of us in need of restoration, in
exile from the Garden. The aim of Kabbalism is the restoration of the
divine man in the medium of mortal man. We are the laboratory and we
are the workers who work in that space.
C. Ponce -- Kabbalah

Within our six-foot body we must strive for the form which existed before
the laying down of heaven and earth.
The Secret of the Golden Flower

The destiny of man is to build the Heavenly Jerusalem on Earth. In other
words, to civilize a planet. It is the aim of the occultist, in consort with all
men of good will, to bring about this heavenly fact into earthly reality.
And the only way it will come about is by every man doing the right thing
at the right time for twenty-four hours a day.
Gareth Knight -- The Work of a Modern Occult Fraternity

The ancient kings in hexagram number-20 base their laws upon their
recognition of diversity among the various forces which make up the kingdom of
the psyche. Their divine regulations therefore represent the proper ecology
existing between heaven and earth, yin and yang, male and female, Logos and
Eros. In this regard, the I Ching's version of the Archetypal Man might be seen
as hexagram number-63, Completion, in which the polarity of each of the lines
is in perfect correlation. (See the editor's commentary on Hexagram number 11
for further insights into this idea.)

The theme of the hexagram is Contemplation of your situation to see if
your attitude meets the archetypal standards of the Work. The worshipper in the
Judgment has purified himself for sacrifice but has not yet carried it out.
Wilhelm uses the word "ablution” in his translation of the Judgment. An
ablution is a ritual cleansing associated with a religious rite:

Ablution: In alchemy ... the adept worker achieves [success] only by
purifying his soul of all that commonly agitates it. Washing, then,
symbolizes the purification not so much of objective and external evil as

20 -- Contemplation -- 20

of subjective and inner evils ... The principle involved in this alchemic
process is that implied in the maxim "Deny thyself."
J. E. Cirlot -- Dictionary of Symbols

It is important to note that the sacrifice has yet to be performed:
preparation is meaningless until it is acted upon. Psychologically, this refers to
intellectual "gnosis" which still needs to be grounded in behavior.

Wisdom is achieved very slowly. This is because intellectual knowledge,
easily acquired, must be transformed into `emotional,' or subconscious,
knowledge. Once transformed, the imprint is permanent. Behavioral
practice is the necessary catalyst of this reaction. Without action, the
concept will wither and fade. Theoretical knowledge without practical
application is not enough ... Intellectually the answers have always been
there, but this need to actualize by experience, to make the subconscious
imprint permanent by `emotionalizing' and practicing the concept, is the
key.
Brian L. Weiss, MD -- Many Lives, Many Masters

Without changing lines, Contemplation is an oracular invitation for you
to consider your situation and especially your motivations in regard to it. One
way of doing this is to reduce everything to a brief written statement, including
your best conscious conclusions. Then ask for a comment from the oracle -- often
it will become apparent that you have been undergoing a kind of examination.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

The ancient kings are mentioned in the Images of both this figure and
number twenty-one, Discernment, immediately following. What are the
differences between Contemplation and Discernment, as depicted in these
images? How does the concept of sacrifice relate to this, as mentioned in the
Judgment? Compare the Judgment of this hexagram with hexagrams and lines
17:6, 45:2, 46:2, 46:4, 47:2, 47:5 and 63:5 for further insights on this extremely
important tenet of the Work.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows the looking of a child -- not blamable in
those of inferior rank, but a matter of regret in superior men.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Boy-like contemplation. For an inferior man, no blame. For
a superior man, humiliation.

Blofeld: Looking at things in a childish way is not blameworthy in ordinary
people, but in the Superior Man it is a misfortune. [ It might be supposed that the
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Superior Man is incapable of such conduct; hence this passage must refer to one
who is trying to be or who thinks himself a Superior Man.]

Liu: Childish observation. For inferior people, no blame. For superior people,
humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Youthful viewing. Small People: without fault. Chun tzu:
abashment.

Shaughnessy: The youth looks up; for the little man there is no trouble, for the
gentleman distress.

Cleary (1): Ignorant observation is not blamed in inferior people, but is
shameful in superior people.

Cleary (2): Naïve observation is blameless in undeveloped people but shameful
in developed people. [When undeveloped people are like children, this is not
considered bad, but if developed people are like children, there is no way to
govern nations and bring peace to earth.]

Wu: His view is like that of a child. There will be no error for a little man, but
humiliation for a jun zi.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This indicates the way of the inferior people. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The way of inferior people. Blofeld: For such conduct is suited to
people of inferior worth. Ritsema/Karcher: Small People: tao indeed. Cleary
(2): The naïve observation represented by the first yin is the way of
underdeveloped people. Wu: Because this is the way of a little man.

Legge: Line one is magnetic and in the lowest place, which is also improper for
it. This suggests the symbol of a thoughtless child who cannot see far -- one who
takes only shallow and superficial views.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man does not comprehend the nature of prevailing forces
nor does he perceive them as a connected whole. The superficial view is
acceptable for the masses, but the superior man should know better.

Wing: Are you just looking at the surface of the situation and its most superficial
effect upon you? This is an inferior, unenlightened form of contemplation. The
superior mind will attempt to see the situation as part of a larger whole. This way
you can know its actual meaning in your life.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Editor: Legge's original translation of this line says "lad” instead of child. I have
altered it to be more in conformance with the magnetic line. No meaning is lost.
The line is completely unambiguous in all translations.

When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
as a child: But when I became a man, I put away childish things.
I Corinthians 13: 11

A. An image of immature and superficial perception.

B. Grow up and accept your responsibilities.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one peeping out from a door. It would
be advantageous if it were merely the firm correctness of a female.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation through the crack of the door. Furthering for
the perseverance of a woman.

Blofeld: Watching through door-cracks is of advantage to women.

Liu: Observation through the cracks of doors. Women benefit by perseverance.
[Now is a better time for action than for quiet.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Peeping-through Viewing. Harvesting: woman Trial.

Shaughnessy: Peeking a look up; beneficial for the maiden to determine.

Cleary (1): Peeking observation is beneficial for a woman’s chastity.

Wu: One peeps through a door. It will be advantageous for a persevering woman.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The firm correctness of a woman in peeping out from a door
is also a thing to be ashamed of in a superior man. Wilhelm/Baynes:
"Contemplation through the crack of the door" is humiliating even where there is
the perseverance of a woman. Blofeld: Nevertheless it is also shameful. [If the
enquirer or the one for whom the enquiry is being made is a woman, she will
gain by keeping a secret watch, but it cannot be done honorably in this case.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Truly permitting the demoniac indeed. Cleary (2): (It) can
also be shameful. Wu: It is nevertheless awkward.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Legge: Line two is magnetic in her proper place, showing a woman who lives
retired and only able to peep through the crack of her door at her fifth-line
correlate. But ignorance and retirement are proper in a woman.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The housewife is understandably ignorant of worldly affairs. But such a
narrow, subjective view of reality is shameful for persons in public life.

Wing: If you have goals more ambitious than maintaining your own private
world, if your dreams extend into the affairs of society, then you must develop a
broader viewpoint. If you relate everything that comes your way in terms of your
own life and attitudes, you cannot develop.

Editor: As hopefully enlightened moderns we wince at what seems to be
outrageous male chauvinism in some of the lines of the I Ching, but if we
understand the symbolism psychologically a non-sexist message comes through.
(Dream symbolism also often offends our conscious convictions.) Female figures
usually represent our instinctive responses and the emotional-feeling aspects of
our personality. Correct behavior demands that emotional responses be kept in
their proper place at "home" within the psyche. This line implies that the
situation demands a more dynamic approach. Note however, that there is no
overt value judgment other than by implication; the puritanical Confucian
commentary is not necessarily always applicable. The line sometimes just
portrays a partial, incomplete view of the situation, saying in effect that "there is
more to the subject than meets the eye.”

If the doors to perception were cleansed, everything would appear to
man as it is, infinite. For man has so closed himself up till he sees all
through narrow chinks of his cavern.
William Blake

A. You have a restricted (possibly narrow-minded) point of view --
dispassionately widen your horizons.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one looking at the course of her own life,
to advance or recede accordingly.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation of my life decides the choice between
advance and retreat.

Blofeld: By contemplating our own lives, we learn to advance or retreat as
required by circumstances.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Liu: Observation of the circumstances of our lives determines whether to
advance or retreat.

Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing my birth, advancing, withdrawing.

Shaughnessy: Looking up at my life advancing and retreating.

Cleary (1): Observing personal growth, promoting and repelling.

Cleary (2): ... advancing and withdrawing.

Wu: He examines his own life to determine whether to advance or retreat.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She will not err in the path to be pursued. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The right way is not lost. Blofeld: This is the way to keep to the right
path. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet letting-go tao indeed. Cleary (2): One has
not lost the way. Wu: He has not forsaken the principle.

Legge: The magnetic third line at the top of the lower trigram of Receptivity
belongs to one of utmost docility. She wishes to act only according to the exigency
of the time and circumstances, and will advance or recede accordingly.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man contemplates the effects of his actions in relation to the exigencies
of the times rather than indulging in idle speculations. Only in this way is he able
to formulate useful guidelines for behavior.

Wing: In order to make the correct decisions in your life, you must gain
objective self-knowledge. This is not accomplished by exploring your own
dreams, attitudes, and opinions. These are useless in self-examination. Instead,
contemplate your effect upon the world around you. There you will find yourself.

Editor: Illusions of "free-will” to the contrary, it is probably accurate to say that
most life experience is not within our control. If this is true, then our only
meaningful choice is to determine how the Tao is flowing and then to put
ourselves in harmony with it. Ritsema/Karcher's Confucian commentary
reminds us of this: “Not-yet letting-go tao indeed.” The oracle is asking you to
make a decision based on your own insight. You may regard it as a test.

Self-reflection or--what comes to the same thing--the urge to
individuation gathers together what is scattered and multifarious, and
exalts it to the original form of the One, the Primordial Man. In this way
our existence as separate beings, our former ego nature, is abolished, the

20 -- Contemplation -- 20

circle of consciousness is widened, and because the paradoxes have been
made conscious the sources of conflict are dried up.
Jung -- Transformation Symbolism in the Mass

A. Examine your options in the matter at hand. What will be the
consequences of the choice you contemplate in terms of the goals of the Work?
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows one contemplating the glory of the
kingdom. It will be advantageous for her, being such as she is, to seek to be a
guest of the king.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation of the light of the kingdom. It furthers one to
exert influence as the guest of a king.

Blofeld: Contemplating the conditions of a realm guides us as to whether we
should become the ruler's guests. [In ancient China, many scholars, such as
Confucius himself, wandered from kingdom to kingdom and princedom to
princedom seeking a ruler wise and virtuous enough to profit by their
teachings. It was by observing the splendors or miseries of each realm that they
were able to form preliminary judgments and thus decide whether the ruler
might be worth approaching or not. The implication is that we must not accept
something as good without waiting to discover whether the alleged good
qualities are genuine.]

Liu: Observation of the glory of the country. It is beneficial to exert influence as
the guest of the leader.

Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing the city's shining. Harvesting: availing-of guesting
tending-towards kinghood.

Shaughnessy: Looking up at the state's radiance; beneficial herewith to be
entertained to audience by the king.

Cleary (1): Observing the glory of the country, it is beneficial to be a guest of a
king.

Wu: He admires the glories of the nation. It will be advantageous to be an
honored guest of the king.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She contemplates the glory of the kingdom. Thence arises
the wish to be a guest at court. Wilhelm/Baynes: One is honored as a guest.
Blofeld: Those engaged in this way enjoy universal esteem. Ritsema/
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Karcher: Honoring guesting indeed. Cleary (2): Esteeming guesthood. Wu:
And the king honors his guest.

Legge: Line four, in a properly magnetic place is just below the properly
dynamic fifth-line sovereign. She is moved accordingly, and stirred to ambition.
The "glory of the kingdom" is the virtue of the sovereign and the noble character
of his administration.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The person who is aware of the factors leading to the glory of the nation
should be appointed by the king to an authoritative position. He should be
honored rather than used as a tool.

Wing: You can now progress by Contemplating society and determining the
best cause, leader, or organization you can join or support. This social awareness
and its enactment will further your growth, for you can transcend your position
as one of the masses and exert significant influence.

Editor: The first line of this hexagram is ignorant and superficial, and not a
proper correlate. Line four correctly turns her eyes upward, sees the
magnificence of the Work and accepts her responsibilities as an honor and sacred
trust. The difference between lines one and four is the difference between callow
ignorance and wisdom. The difference between lines three and four is the
difference between ego issues and devotion to the Work.

Whereas in some traditions the object is to become detached from the
world, Kabbalah states that while we are in exile we do the work given to
Adam that is to till the ground and await the coming of the Messiah. This
will occur when we are fit to receive him, and he may arrive at any
moment for each of us. So our position is plain. We are where we are
needed. No one can fill our place. Each one of us has a particular job in
the universe, and we have the capability of fulfilling that destiny. But
before we can perform it with the maximum efficiency, we have to know
what we are and what is our capacity. For this purpose the Kabbalah is
studied.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree

A. Examine the situation at hand and do what needs to be done in
accordance with the goals of the Work.

B. One accepts responsibility for the Work as an honor.

C. The Self is the source of your truth -- how may you best serve its
purposes now?
20 -- Contemplation -- 20
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject contemplating his own life
course. A superior man, he will thus fall into no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation of my life. The superior man is without
blame.

Blofeld: The Superior Man does no wrong in keeping a watch upon our lives.
[It is not wrong for us to be curious about the affairs of others if our motive is to
be of more help to them.]

Liu: Observation of ourselves. No blame for the superior man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing my birth. A chun tzu: without fault.

Shaughnessy: Looking up at my life; for the gentleman there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Observing personal growth, a superior person is blameless.

Cleary (2): ... Developed people are impeccable.

Wu: He examines his own life. The jun zi is without blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He should for this purpose contemplate the condition of
the people. Wilhelm/Baynes: "Contemplation of my life,” that is,
contemplation of the people. Blofeld: In this passage, "our lives” means the
lives of the people. Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing the commoners indeed. Cleary
(2): What is appropriate for a great leader is balance in action. Wu: He actually
looks after his people.

Legge: Line five is dynamic, and in the place of the ruler. He is a superior man,
but this does not relieve him from the duty of self-contemplation or examination.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man in a position of power studies the impact of his life upon the
welfare of others. If he so conducts himself that the condition of the people is
always good, he will not fall into error.

Wing: You will gain an understanding of what the future holds for you by
Contemplating the effect of your life upon others. If your influence and
example are good, then you are without blame. This, you will find, is its own
reward.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20

Editor: Notice that the Confucian commentary equates the contemplation of the
life course of the ruler with the contemplation of the condition of the people.
Psychologically, "the people” are the various components of the psyche, and the
line is an injunction to compare our current situation with the ideal image of the
Work alluded to in the Judgment. In other words, the oracle will not answer your
question until you have first made a sincere effort to analyze your situation.
Often this will result in a different perspective, and either cancel the original
question or evoke an entirely new one.

The motions akin to the divine part in us are the thoughts and
revolutions of the universe; these, therefore, every man should follow,
and correcting those circuits in the head that were deranged at birth, by
learning to know the harmonies and revolutions of the world, he should
bring the intelligent part, according to its pristine nature, into the
likeness of that which intelligence discerns, and thereby win the
fulfillment of the best life set by the gods before mankind both for this
present time and for the time to come.
Plato -- The Timaeus

A. Differentiate your thoughts and feelings and compare your situation
with the ideal toward which you aspire.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject contemplating his character to
see if it be indeed that of a superior man. He will not fall into error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contemplation of his life. The superior man is without
blame.

Blofeld: Nor will it be an error for the Superior Man to contemplate his own
life.

Liu: Observation of the lives of others. No blame for the superior man. [This is
a time of discontent.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Viewing one's birth. A chun tzu: without fault.

Shaughnessy: Looking up at his life; for the gentleman there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Observing the growth, the superior person is blameless.

Cleary (2): ... Developed people are impeccable.

Wu: He looks pensively at the life of the people. The jun zi is without blame.
20 -- Contemplation -- 20
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He cannot even yet let his mind be at rest. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The will is not yet pacified. Blofeld: He contemplates his own life
when troubled as to what course to take. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose not-yet
evened indeed. Cleary (2): The mind is not yet at peace. Wu: His aspirations
have not been all fulfilled.

Legge: There is a slight difference in the sixth line from the fifth which can
hardly be expressed in a translation. By making a change in the punctuation,
however, the different significance may be brought out. Line six is dynamic, and
should be considered out of the work of the hexagram, but he is still possessed by
its spirit, and is led to self- examination.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The sage, who is living outside the routine of the world, contemplates his
own character, not as an isolated ego manifestation, but in relation to the laws of
life. He judges freedom from blame to be the highest good.

Wing: You are somewhat beyond the situation and able to contemplate your life
without egotistical involvement. You will discover, here, that freedom from error
and blame are the highest good. Egoless contemplation is the key.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the fifth line represents an ego
contemplating his multi-faceted psyche; here, the sixth line has risen above that
standpoint to contemplate the nature of the whole reality with which it wishes to
unite. Line five asks us to look within to see if the motivations of the psyche are in
accordance with the goals of the Work; line six asks us to examine our
comprehension of the individuation process itself to see if it is correct.
Note that Liu translates this as contemplating “the lives of others” and Wu “the
life of the people” – in these versions the object of contemplation is placed
outside of the observer’s psyche. When differentiating line 5 from line 6, this
interpretation of their slight divergence makes the most sense. Sometimes there
is an implication that you may misunderstand something pertaining to the Work.

The Self, being individual and unique, is made manifest in the
individuation process of the individual. But the Self is also universal and
eternal, and under this aspect it is made manifest in a process we can
only call the individuation of mankind. It is a collective process that
takes the form of a gradual extension and differentiation of consciousness
over the millennia. The drama began in the gray mists of antiquity and
continues through the centuries into a remote future.

Punishment by Pressing and Squeezing, Gnawing Bite, Severing, Chewing,
Punishment, Reformation, Reform, Differentiation, Discrimination, Making a
Distinction, Getting the message "Something which should be, or has to be bitten
through. This is essentially the legal hexagram. When asking about a man's
intentions, he is probably married." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Success is found in Discernment. The restrictions of the law bring
advantage.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Biting Through has success. It is favorable to let justice be
administered.

Blofeld: Gnawing. Success! The time is favorable for legal processes. [The
concept of gnawing is suggested by the component trigrams, which are
regarded (owing to the arrangement of their lines) as not commingling; they
are as separate from each other as the upper and lower jaw when something
tough is being gnawed.]

Liu: Chewing: Success. It benefits to administer justice. [Chewing indicates
success through hard work. Those who get this hexagram will have trouble in
the beginning.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Gnawing Bite, Growing. Harvesting: availing of
litigating. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of confronting a
tenacious obstacle. It emphasizes that biting through and picking things clean
until the essential is revealed is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord
with the time, you are told to: gnaw and bite through!]

Shaughnessy: Biting and chewing: Receipt; beneficial to use a court case.

Cleary (1): Biting through is developmental. It is beneficial to administer
justice.

Cleary (2): Biting through is successful. It is beneficial to apply justice.

Wu: Discernment is pervasive. It will be advantageous to exact punishments.
21 -- Discernment -- 21

The Image

Legge: The images of thunder and lightning form Discernment. Thus the
ancient kings promulgated their laws and framed their penalties with
intelligence.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder and lightning: The image of Biting Through.
Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws through clearly defined
penalties.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes lightning accompanied by thunder. The
ancient rulers, after making their legal code perfectly clear to all, enforced the
laws vigorously. [The firm and yielding lines more or less alternate; or the lower
trigram can be regarded as filled with the power of thunderous force, while the
upper trigram, representing beauty, is soft and yielding. (Li, the upper trigram,
stands for lightning as well as for fire, beauty, etc.) I do not know what the
ancient Chinese views on thunder and lightning were; it appears from this that
they were regarded as two forces which, like steel and flint, emitted brilliance
when brought into sharp contact with each other. A pair of trigrams both with
yielding centers is not felt to be a good arrangement; that it nevertheless favors
the process of the law may have been suggested to the writer of the Text by the
fact that the weak lines (morally weak people?) are fully contained by the
strong (prison walls, warders and so forth?)]

Liu: Thunder and lightning symbolize Chewing. The ancient kings made the
laws and clarified the penalties.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder, lightning. Gnawing Bite. The Earlier Kings
used brightening flogging to enforce the laws.

Cleary (1): Thunder and lightning, biting through. Thus did the kings of yore
clarify penalties and proclaim laws. [Those who administer laws should emulate
the ancient kings in first clarifying them before executing them, in order to
avoid mistakenly injuring life.]

Wu: Thunder and lightning form Discernment. Thus the ancient kings made
just punishments and upheld the law of the land.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The existence of something between the jaws gives rise to
the name Discernment -- union by means of biting through the intervening
article. The dynamic and magnetic lines are equally divided in the figure.
Movement is denoted by the lower trigram, and Clarity by the upper -- thunder
and lightning uniting in them, and having brilliant manifestation. The magnetic
21 -- Discernment -- 21

fifth line is in the center, and acts in her high position. Although she is not in her
proper place, this is advantageous for the use of legal constraints.

Legge: Discernment means literally "union by gnawing." The figure consists
of undivided lines in the top, bottom and fourth places -- giving the image of open
jaws with something in them "being gnawed." When the object has been bitten
through, the upper and lower jaws come together in union -- hence: "Union by
gnawing." Remove the obstacles to union and high and low will meet together in
understanding. The force exerted by gnawing suggests the idea of legal
constraints.

The equal division of the dynamic and magnetic lines is seen by taking them in
pairs, though the order of the first pair is different from the other two. The
magnetic fifth line is the ruler of the hexagram, indicating that judgment is
tempered by leniency.

Ch'eng-tzu says that thunder and lightning are always found together, and hence
their trigrams go together to give the idea of union intended in Discernment:
one trigram symbolizing majesty and the other intelligence.

Cleary (1): Practice of the Tao is like administering justice: Discerning true and
false, right and wrong, is like the judge deciding good and bad; getting rid of
falsehood and keeping truth, so as to preserve essence and life, is like the [just]
administration rewarding the good and punishing the bad, so as to alleviate the
burden of injustice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Further the Work through careful Discernment between what is
true and false, right and wrong, correct and incorrect.

The Image portrays the connection between cause and effect, where
consequences are always based on the inexorable laws of nature.

To bite is to comprehend, and to bite through is to make distinctions. The
top and bottom lines of the hexagram represent the upper and lower jaws, and
both bear images of restriction and punishment. Each of the lines between them
portrays some version of biting through flesh. Hence, the jaws define the general
problem, and the teeth differentiate the details.

The symbol of losing teeth has the primitive meaning of losing one's grip
because under primitive circumstances and in the animal kingdom, the
teeth and mouth are the gripping organ. If one loses teeth, one loses the
grip on something. Now this can mean a loss of self-control, etc. The
English word grip is contained in the German word begriff (conception

21 -- Discernment -- 21

or notion). The Latin word conceptio means the same, i.e., catching hold
of something, having a grip on something.
Jung -- Letters

In I Ching symbolism, the "ancient kings” are always synonymous with
spiritual authority. Analogous to gods or cosmic forces, their "laws" are like the
laws of karma or of nature -- inexorable in their outcome. Therefore, the
punishment theme in the hexagram warns us that a lack of Discernment in the
matter at hand has built-in penalties: i.e., "Get the message or suffer the
consequences.”

Behold, sin and punishment are one, and the fire of punishment is the fire
that refines my works. Even in the sinner I am the actor, and I, too, am
the sufferer in the experience of punishment.
P.F. Case -- The Book of Tokens

To receive this hexagram without changing lines indicates a need to make
some important distinctions in the matter at hand. “Figure it out” might make
a good alternate title at such times. Cleary’s Taoist note on the image (“Those
who administer laws should emulate the ancient kings in first clarifying them
before executing them, in order to avoid mistakenly injuring life”) is a clear
admonition to get all of your facts straight before proceeding with your inquiry.
That you don’t know or understand something is implied.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

The twenty-first hexagram turned upside down becomes the twenty-
second. The message for the superior man in the Image of each concerns the
enforcement of law. What is the relationship between Discernment and
Persona in such a context? The component trigrams of these two figures also
make up hexagrams number fifty-five, Expansion of Awareness and number
fifty-six, Transition. The messages for the superior man in each of these figures
also relate to litigation. Why? What do the four hexagrams suggest about the
nature of the Work?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows one with his feet in the stocks and
deprived of his toes. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His feet are fastened in the stocks so that his toes disappear.
No blame.

Blofeld: The feet are shackled so that they may not walk -- no error is involved!
[This line suggests that extreme firmness would not be culpable at this time.]
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Liu: His feet are put in the stocks. It will injure his toes. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shoes locked-up, submerging the feet. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Wearing stocks on the feet and with cut off feet; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Wearing stocks stopping the feet, there is no blame.

Wu: He wears a pair of shackles, which covers his toes. There is no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is no walking to do evil. Wilhelm/Baynes: He
cannot walk. Blofeld: This method is used to prevent evil-doers from
progressing in their wickedness. Ritsema/Karcher: Not moving indeed.
Cleary (2): Means not acting. Wu: The light punishment warns him not to walk
the wrong path again.

The Master said: The inferior man is not ashamed of what is not benevolent,
nor does he fear to do what is not righteous. Without the prospect of gain he
does not stimulate himself to what is good, nor does he correct himself without
being moved. Self-correction, however, in what is small will make him careful in
what would be of greater consequence; and this is the happiness of the inferior
man. It is said in the I Ching, "His feet are in the stocks, and he is disabled in
his toes - there will be no further occasion for blame."

Legge: The first and last lines of the hexagram are undergoing punishment
which is inflicted by the other lines. Line one's offense is minor, and he is
confined to the stocks to prevent him from making it worse.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man receives a mild sentence as a warning for a small
offense.

Wing: Since this is only your first departure from the right path, only a mild
punishment is forthcoming. This should serve the purpose of early Reform.

Editor: To be deprived of one's toes is to be unable to move -- the toes (or feet in
some translations) are found in seven hexagrams, and all but one appear in the
first line which indicates the beginning of movement. The idea is to nip a bad
choice in the bud before it gains momentum. Sometimes the line can refer to
circumstances beyond one's control which prevent one from taking an ill-
considered or harmful action.
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Even the venerable Church Fathers had to admit that evil is not only
unavoidable but actually necessary in order to avert a greater evil...
Punishment is also an evil and just as much a transgression as crime. It is
simply the crime of society against the crime of the individual. And this
evil, too, is unavoidable and necessary.
Jung -- Letters

A. You are held fast to prevent mistakes. Comprehension or growth is effected
through restricted circumstances.

B. Circumstances impede or prevent action.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one biting through soft flesh, and going
on to bite off the nose. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bites through tender meat, so that his nose disappears. No
blame.

Blofeld: Gnawing flesh so that the nose is hidden in it --no error! [The
meaning of this line is not at all obvious. The Chinese additional commentaries
take it to mean that we may do a little harm to our own interests but that we
shall not deserve blame for what happens.]

Liu: Biting the skin, his nose is cut. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Gnawing flesh, submerging the nose. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Biting flesh and cutting off the nose; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Biting skin, cutting off the nose, etc.

Cleary (2): Biting through the skin, destroying the nose, etc. [This is
investigating principle and gradually penetrating.]

Wu: He bites through a skin burying his nose in it, etc. [This makes it easy for
him to judge the case like biting through a soft skin ...The judgment seems to
have cautioned mildly not to over-judge an easy case.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She is mounted on the dynamic first line. Wilhelm/
Baynes: He rests upon a hard line. Blofeld: This is indicated by the position of
the line (a yielding one) above a firm one. Ritsema/Karcher: Riding a solid
indeed. Cleary (2): Riding on strength. Wu: He is riding on a yang.
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Legge: Line two is appropriately magnetic in a central place, therefore her action
should be effective. This is shown by her biting through the soft flesh -- an easy
thing. Immediately below, however, is a strong offender represented by the first
line. Before he will submit it is necessary to bite off his nose. Punishment is the
rule, and it must be continued and increased until the end is secured. Ch'eng-Tzu
says: "Being mounted on the dynamic first line means punishing a strong and
vehement man, when severity is required, as is denoted by the central position
of the line."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The hardened sinner must be punished severely to secure the desired ends.
Although indignation often goes too far in meting out punishment, it may still be
just.

Wing: Punishment and retribution come swiftly and thoroughly to the person
who continues in wrong behavior. Even though it may seem overly severe, it will
effectively bring about Reform. Finally, there is no mistake in this.

Editor: This is an interestingly ambiguous line which admits of more than one
interpretation. I have always taken the hexagram as symbolic of the process of
differentiation, so the following associations come from that perspective: Bite:
To "get your teeth into" something is to get a grip on it, to comprehend it. Flesh:
Meat, food, nourishment -- the raw material, data or experience of the situation
at hand. Soft: Easily bitten and penetrated. An easy discrimination. Nose:
Intuition, subtle discrimination, as: "I smell a rat.” The various translators
indicate that the nose is either injured or buried in the meat, suggesting that the
intuitive faculty is damaged or obscured by an overly easy act of mental
discrimination. A simplistic comprehension goes too far, but since the idea of "No
Blame" is attached to the line this seems to be a natural consequence of the
situation. A syllogism might go like this: "Drunk drivers are bad. George is a
drunken driver, therefore George is bad.” This is the easy discrimination. The
subtle discrimination is that George, normally a modest drinker, was required by
his Embassy job to drink toasts with the Russian ambassador and he
miscalculated his capacity to hold his liquor. The easy distinction over-rides the
subtle one because the offense is serious enough to require a severe punishment.
The line can sometimes suggest the squabbles of lawyers, and the differences
between the spirit and letter of the law.

The world of the soul and the realms of the spirit can only be known to
him whose inner senses are awakened to life. The things of the body are
seen through the instrumentality of the body, but the things of the soul
require the power of spiritual perception.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

21 -- Discernment -- 21

A. An oversimplification is better than a total illusion: half-true is better than
totally false.

B. Suggests a conclusion based upon simplistic reasoning. You only see the
obvious: seek the subtle hidden within the obvious.

C. “There is more to the subject than meets the eye.”
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one gnawing dried flesh, and meeting
with what is disagreeable. There will be occasion for some small regret, but no
great error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bites on old dried meat and strikes something poisonous.
Slight humiliation. No blame.

Blofeld: Gnawing dried meat, he was poisoned, but not severely enough to
indispose him for long -- no error! [This line presages trouble through no fault of
ours which will not, however, incapacitate us for long.]

Liu: By chewing dried salt meat one gets poisoned. Small humiliation, but no
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Gnawing seasoned meat. Meeting poison. The small

abashed. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Biting dried meat and meeting with poison; small distress; there
is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Biting on dried meat, running into poison. There is a little shame,
but no blame.

Wu: He bites dried salted meat and gets an unpleasant aftertaste. There will be
slight regret, but no error. [A yin in a yang position makes his judgment hard
like biting on dried cured meat. The “unpleasant aftertaste” may suggest he is
biting more than he can chew, he faces rowdy offenders, or he has a little rough
time. But he makes no error.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She meets with what is disagreeable and hurtful -- her
position is not the proper one for her. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the
appropriate one. Blofeld: His being poisoned is indicated by the unsuitable
21 -- Discernment -- 21

position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Wu:
His position is improper.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place. Her action will be ineffective,
and is symbolized by gnawing through tough meat only to taste something
rancid. Since punishment is the rule in this hexagram, the auspice is not all bad.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man lacks sufficient power and authority and the culprit does not
submit to him. It is like biting through old dried meat and coming upon
something poisonous. Some humiliation results but no blame.

Wing: You lack sufficient power and authority to bring about Reform. Your
attempts meet with indifference, and you may feel humiliated at your ineffective
actions. Yet Reform is necessary, and therefore your endeavors are justified.

Editor: In his commentary Wilhelm emphasizes that "the matter at issue is
an old one.” A magnetic line in a dynamic place suggests weakness or passivity
which is unable to deal very effectively with a long-standing problem. Implicit
also is the idea of confronting something disagreeable within one's own psyche.

For there are very many kinds of evil which formed the delight of his
former life, that is of the old life. These evils cannot all be subdued at
once and together; for they cleave tenaciously, since they have been
inrooted in the parents for many ages back, and are therefore innate in
man, and are confirmed by actual evils from himself from infancy.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

A. You seem impotent in coming to grips with an old issue. Recognition and
acceptance of this are the first steps toward initiating needed reforms.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows one gnawing the flesh dried on the bone,
and getting the pledges of money and arrows. It will be advantageous for him to
realize the difficulty of his task and be firm -- in which case there will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bites on dried gristly meat. Receives metal arrows. It
furthers one to be mindful of difficulties and to be persevering. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Gnawing dried meat on the bone, he found a metal arrow-head
embedded in it -- remaining determined in spite of difficulties will bring good
fortune!
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Liu: By chewing on dried gristle one gains golden arrows. Firmness and hard
work benefit. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Gnawing parched meat-bones. Acquiring a metallic arrow.
Harvesting: drudgery, Trial. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Biting dry preserved meat, and getting a metal arrowhead;
determination about difficulty is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Biting bony dried meat, one gets the wherewithal to proceed. It
is beneficial to work hard and be upright: this leads to good results.

Wu: He bites dried bony meat and gets a golden arrow. There will be good
fortune if he realizes the advantage of being firm in a difficult time. [With
inference (Sic) to what he is biting, he also has a hard time reaching his
verdict... The Confucian Commentary is somewhat critical of his ability.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His light has not yet been sufficiently displayed.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not yet give light. Blofeld: However, no ray of the
good fortune here indicated is visible as yet. [Whatever good fortune is on its
way to us is not visible as yet. In other words, the situation looks more gloomy
than it is, so we must follow our course with firmness.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Not yet shining indeed. Wu: Because he has not shown brilliance.

Legge: Of old in a civil case, both parties brought to the court an arrow in
testimony of their rectitude, after which they were heard. In a criminal case they
in the same way each deposited thirty pounds of gold, or some other metal. The
fourth-line judge who receives these pledges is responsible for "gnawing through”
a difficult case and rendering a just verdict. Though dynamic, he is in a magnetic
place, and hence the cautionary warning. "His light has not been sufficiently
displayed" means that there is still something for him to do. He has to realize the
difficulty of his position and be firm.

Anthony: Here we begin to see success in our effort to punish: the other person
begins to relate to us correctly. But, this is only a first step; we must avoid the
temptation to rush back to a comfortable and careless relationship that would
collapse our work. Our tendency is either to be steeled in perseverance or relaxed
in an easy relationship with others. If we can, instead, be neutral and persevering,
be neither soft nor hard, but open, cautious and careful, we will “bite through”
the obstacles to a correct fellowship with others.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Great obstacles in the form of strong opponents require the man to
make difficult judgments. All goes well if he cautiously perseveres.
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Wing: The task facing you is indeed difficult. That which you must overcome is
in a powerful position. Be firm and persevering once you begin. Good results
come only by being alert and exercising continuous effort.

Editor: The fourth yang line is the object being gnawed in the pictorial
symbolism of the hexagram. Flesh: Meat, food, nourishment -- the raw material,
data or experience of the situation. Dried: Tough, hard to chew and digest --
difficult to differentiate, sort-out or comprehend. Metal: Metal usually
symbolizes the mental faculties -- intellect, discernment, etc. It can also refer to
allied components of the psyche, such as the will, as in: "He has a will of iron.”
Arrow: The arrow has associations similar to the sword -- the discriminating
function. To shoot an arrow into the heart of the matter is to pierce its essence, to
comprehend it completely. Light: (From Confucian commentary): Clarity,
comprehension, understanding. Overall, the implication is that you are not yet
clear-minded enough to deal decisively with the situation at hand.

Jung's development of new symbolic categories can be compared with a
similar approach initiated by the modern physicist. In both cases the
subject matter defies comprehension in accustomed rational categories;
hence symbolic "working models" or working hypotheses, such as the
archetype or the atom, had to be set up in order to describe as
adequately as possible the way an otherwise indescribable unknown acts
in the world of matter.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Although you do not understand the situation completely, in dealing with it
you will receive the insights needed for its resolution. Proceed with the awareness
of difficulty.

B. The answer is implicit within the question.

C. Figure it out for yourself.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows one gnawing at dried flesh, and finding
the yellow gold. Let her be firm and correct, realizing the peril of her position.
There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bites on dried lean meat. Receives yellow gold.
Perseveringly aware of danger. No blame.

Blofeld: While gnawing dried meat, he encountered a piece of gold embedded
in it -- unwavering determination now will bring down trouble, but no error is
21 -- Discernment -- 21

involved. [If we persist with our plans, trouble will arise; the only comfort we
can take is that we shall not be to blame for it.]

Liu: By chewing the dried meat one gains gold. To continue is dangerous. No
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Gnawing parched meat. Acquiring yellow metal. Trial:
adversity. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Biting dry meat and meeting with poison; determination is
dangerous; there is no trouble.

Cleary (2): Biting dry meat, finding gold, if one is upright and diligent there
will be no blame.

Wu: He bites dried meat and gets yellow gold. He will have no error if he
remains perseverant in such a critical situation. [What he bites suggests he still
has a hard time simply because he is not strong-minded. A softhearted person
vested with the authority of a judge should be perseverant in impartiality.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She will possess every quality appropriate to her position
and task. Wilhelm/Baynes: She has found what is appropriate. Blofeld: That
we shall not be to blame for the trouble is indicated by the suitable position of
this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring the appropriate indeed. Cleary (2):
This is finding what is appropriate. Wu: Because he acts properly.

Legge: The fifth line represents the ruler and judge. As it is a magnetic line, she
will be disposed to leniency, and her judgments will be correct. This is shown by
her finding the "yellow metal." (Yellow is one of the five "correct" colors.) The
position is in the center, but because the line is magnetic, a caution is given, as
under the previous line.

Anthony: We would like to be lenient, but our job is to be impartial. To accept
an alliance merely because the other person wants it, while they are not firmly
committed to being correct, would be wrong. They must realize, through their
own perception, that correctness is the only path to an alliance, and that spiritual
growth is the source of unity that endures.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A clear-cut case meets with difficulty because of a tendency to be lenient.
The man must be as true as gold and as impartial as the mean.
21 -- Discernment -- 21

Wing: Even though there are few alternatives, a decision is difficult to make.
Once you choose the course you will take, do not waver from your decision.
Remain aware of the dangers and in this way you will surmount them.

Editor: Flesh: Meat, food, nourishment -- the raw material, data or experience
of the situation at hand. Dried: Tough, difficult to chew and digest -- difficult to
sort out, comprehend or accept as true. Yellow: Color of the mean, of the sun --
suggests wisdom which comes from clarity, balanced perception. Gold: The
supreme treasure, Divine Intelligence, truth.

When a man sins, good and evil are intermingled. A legal opinion is a
clear separation between the permitted and the forbidden, the clean and
the unclean. When you study religious law, good is once again separated
from the evil and the sin is rectified.
Rabbi Nachman of Breslov

A. Sorting out a complex issue involves difficulty, but success is possible -- you
have the resources to comprehend the matter.

B. Success lies in making a hard choice.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows one wearing the cangue, and deprived of
his ears. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue, so that his ears
disappear. Misfortune.

Blofeld: He wears a wooden cangue which hides his ears -- misfortune!

Liu: His neck is put in the wooden collar. His ear is injured. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore locking-up submerging the ears? Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Carrying a cangue on the shoulders and with a cut-off ear;
inauspicious.

Cleary (2): Wearing a cangue destroying the ears is unfortunate.

Wu: He wears a cangue that covers his ears. There will be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He wears the cangue and is deprived of his ears -- he hears,
but will not understand. Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not hear clearly. Blofeld:
21 -- Discernment -- 21

This implies dullness of hearing or intellect. [This suggests that, for the present,
we should not put much trust in our own judgment.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Understanding not brightened indeed. Cleary (2): Means not listening clearly.
Wu: Because he hears, but does not heed.

From the Great Treatise: If acts of goodness be not accumulated, they are not
sufficient to give its finish to one's name; if acts of evil be not accumulated, they
are not sufficient to destroy one's life. The inferior man thinks that small acts of
goodness are of no benefit, and does not do them; and that small deeds of evil do
no harm, and does not abstain from them. Hence his wickedness becomes great
till it cannot be pardoned. This is what the I Ching says, "He wears the cangue
and his ears are destroyed: there will be evil."

Legge: The action of the hexagram has passed, and here we have one still
persisting in wrongdoing. He is a strong criminal, wearing the cangue and deaf to
counsel. Of course the auspice is evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is deaf to repeated warnings. Evil accumulates, as he thinks,
"Small sins do no harm.” His guilt grows until it cannot be pardoned.

Wing: A person who cannot recognize his own shortcomings will drift farther
and farther from the path. A person who is no longer on the path cannot
understand the warnings of others. The original text states: "There will be evil.”

Editor: Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines
"Cangue" as: "A wooden collar three or four feet square used in oriental
countries for confining the neck and sometimes also the hands for punishment.”
It is a more severe analogue of the stocks mentioned in the first line of the
hexagram.

He who rejects discipline despises his own self; he who listens to
correction wins discernment.
Proverbs 15: 32

A. You haven't gotten the message and must suffer the consequences of your lack
of comprehension.

B. "Deaf to counsel." Stubborn illusions prevent you from making a connection.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-TWO –
PERSONA

Other titles: Grace, The Symbol of Decoration, Elegance, Gracefulness,
Luxuriance, Adorning, Public Image, Adornment, Beauty, Conceit, Vanity,
Veneer, Façade, Manners, Embellishment, Superficiality, Superficial
Appearances, Form vs. Function, "Art," Ego-trips, "Often refers to conceit,
vanity or beauty. It stresses that the content is more important than the
outward appearance." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Persona should be given its due, but there is no advantage in allowing it
to advance and take the lead.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Grace has success. In small matters it is favorable to
undertake something.

Blofeld: Elegance. Success! Some small advantage can be derived from having
a particular goal (or destination). [The implication is that the advantage is not
sufficient to make it worth while to seek that goal or destination unless no
special difficulty or inconvenience is involved. The arrangement of the lines in
this hexagram is very similar to that in the previous one, but it is adjudged
much more suitable. The general idea is that, like nature, we should conform to
a regular and well ordered pattern of behavior which, since we are human
beings and not mere animals, involves a high degree of refinement. From the
point of view of divination, it would seem that this is a time to watch carefully
so as to learn how those involved in the situation think and behave, the better to
influence them for the good when the opportunity arises.]

Liu: Gracefulness, success. Small undertakings benefit.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning, Growing. The small, Harvesting: possessing
directed going. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of its outward
presentation. It emphasizes that building intrinsic value by embellishing
appearance and displaying valor is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Luxuriance: Receipt; a little beneficial to have someplace to
go.

Cleary (1): Adornment is developmental. It is beneficial to go somewhere in a
minimal way.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Cleary (2): Adornment is successful. It is beneficial to go somewhere in a
small way.

Wu: Adornment is pervasive and shows small advantage of an undertaking.
[Adornment does not change the nature of what it adorns, but merely makes
what it adorns appear more attractive. In other words, the change is mostly
superficial but not substantive...]

The Image

Legge: Fire at the foot of the mountain -- the image of Persona. Thus the
superior man adorns his rule with grace, but makes important decisions in
conformance with higher laws.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fire at the foot of the mountain: the image of Grace. Thus
does the superior man proceed when clearing up current affairs. But he dare not
decide controversial issues in this way.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire at the foot of a mountain. The Superior
Man, desiring to ensure the enlightened functioning of the various departments
of state, dare not make light decisions regarding legal matters. [The component
trigrams, fire below mountain, suggest a brilliance which cannot be perceived
from afar. The Chinese commentators go on to suggest that this symbolizes a
firm and somewhat severe exterior which hides brilliance and the beauty
within. For purposes of divination, this should be taken as a pattern for our
comportment in the matter at issue.]

Liu: Fire illuminates the base of the mountain symbolizing Gracefulness. Thus
the superior man clarifies ordinary affairs, but does not judge lawsuits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below mountain possessing fire. Adorning. A chun tzu uses
brightening the multitudinous standards without daring to sever litigating.

Cleary (1): There is fire below the mountain, adorning it. Thus do superior
people clarify governmental affairs, without presumptuous adjudication. [What
superior people see in this is that just as the light of a fire below a mountain is
not great, when people are lacking in capacity their vision is not far reaching;
therefore the superior people administer and clarify the simple matters of
governmental affairs, and do not act presumptuously in difficult matters of
adjudication... Not judging presumptuously thus has the meaning of respect for
life.]

Wu: There is fire at the foot of the mountain; this is Adornment. The jun zi
brings openness to administering civil affairs, but refrains from judging cases in
criminal litigation.
22 -- Persona -- 22
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Persona we see the magnetic central line ornamenting
the dynamic lines of the lower trigram, and hence it is said that ornament should
have free course. On the other hand, the dynamic top line ornaments the
magnetic lines of the upper trigram, and hence it is said that there will be little
advantage if ornament is allowed to advance and take the lead. The elegance and
intelligence of the lower trigram is regulated by the restraint of the upper trigram.
This suggests the observances which adorn human society. We observe the
ornamental figures of the sky, and thereby ascertain the changes of the seasons.
We observe the ceremonial customs of society, and understand how
transformation is accomplished in the world.

Legge: Persona is the symbol of what is ornamental and of the act of adorning.
As there is adornment in nature, so should there be in society, but its place is
secondary to that which is substantial.

The K'ang-hsi editors say that the magnetic line coming and ornamenting the two
dynamic lines in the lower trigram shows how substantiality should have the
benefit of ornamentation. The dynamic line ornamenting the two magnetic lines
in the upper trigram shows how ornamentation should be restrained by
substantiality. Ornament has its use, but it should be kept in check.

The figures of the sky are all the heavenly bodies in their relative positions and
various movements, producing day and night, heat and cold, etc. The
observances of society are the ceremonies and performances which regulate and
beautify the intercourse of men.

"A mountain," says Ch'eng-tzu, "is a place where we find grass, trees, and a
hundred other things. A fire burning below it throws up its light, and brings
them all out in beauty. This gives the idea of ornament, or being ornamented.
The various processes of government are small matters, and elegance and
ornament help their course, but great matters of judgment demand the simple,
unadorned truth.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: There's nothing wrong with showing a little style, but don't become
so identified with a role that it makes your decisions for you.

The Superior Man displays wit and charm when that is appropriate, but relies
upon shrewd discernment when making serious choices.

Confucius points out the correct attitude for this hexagram in his third
sentence -- the elegant intelligence, or "brilliant wit" of the lower trigram is being
"sat on" by the mountain of the upper trigram. Brilliant wit is often just an
"ornament" to make one look clever in the company of others. Like seasoning on
22 -- Persona -- 22

food, a little bit of Persona or ornamentation is life-enhancing, but too much
curry powder overwhelms the meal.

Jung's conception of the Persona points out the fact that it is a major
vehicle for the complexes to express themselves under the guise of social
interaction:

(The Persona) is only a mask for the collective psyche, a mask that feigns
individuality, and tries to make others and oneself believe that one is
individual, whereas one is simply playing a part in which the collective
psyche speaks.
Jung -- The Relations between the Ego and the
Unconscious

For an urban shipping clerk to wear cowboy clothes may be a legitimate
expression of his personality, or it may be the only outlet available for repressed
portions of his psyche. When he begins driving a pickup truck and frequenting
Country-Western bars we might suspect that his role is playing him and the real
Self is being masked by excessive ornamentation or Persona.

The person cannot be more than an instrument for the manifestation of
the self. But people get so attached to their mask that they cannot free
themselves from it any more ... They make a king out of the servant and
separate themselves from their true being. They force their higher self
into exile, into the unconscious.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

To receive this hexagram without changing lines suggests that perhaps you
are more focused on form than meaning, or that superficial appearances are
concealing something more substantive in the situation. Look deeper – what’s
really going on?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows one adorning the way of his feet. He can
discard a carriage and walk on foot.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage and walks.

Blofeld: Elegantly shod, he leaves his carriage and proceeds on foot.

Liu: He decorates his toes and leaves the carriage. He would rather walk.
[Activity benefits, but stagnation does not.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning one's feet. Stowing-away the chariot and-also
afoot.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Shaughnessy: Making luxurious his feet; discarding the chariot and going on
foot.

Cleary (1): Adorning the feet, leaving the car and walking.

Cleary (2): Adorn the feet; leave the car and walk.

Wu: He adorns his toes, leaves the carriage behind and walks.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Righteousness requires that he should not ride. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It accords with duty not to ride. Blofeld: He declines to make use of
the carriage at his disposal. [This implies progressing in the way we know to be
right and declining the help of those who are anxious to lead us from the path of
rectitude.] Ritsema/Karcher: Righteously nothing to ride indeed. Cleary (2):
It is right not to ride. Wu: Because it is right not to ride in it.

Legge: Line one is dynamic in a dynamic place at the bottom of the hexagram.
He is also the first line in the trigram of fire or light, suggesting what is elegant
and bright. He has nothing to do but to attend to himself; therefore he cultivates
(adorns) himself in his humble position. If righteousness demands it he can give
up every luxury and indulgence. He neither cares for nor needs adornment, and
will walk in the way of righteousness without it.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is tempted to create a falsely flattering public image
for himself. A simple demeanor is more gracious and fitting to his position.

Wing: Move forward under your own power and avoid false appearances,
dubious shortcuts, or ostentatious behavior. It is most important now that you
rely upon your own worth.

Wilhelm: (from Lectures on the I Ching): Now the attribute of art, or grace,
consists of discarding all nonessential adornments. It consists of leaving out
everything superfluous and of confining art to its appointed place.

Editor: The feet here are regarded as more substantive than the carriage,
suggesting that one must rely on one's own inner worth rather than a "vehicle" of
ostentatious superficiality. Suggested is the need to abandon a crutch of some
kind.

The Self is the entity, then, that "plots" the way for an individual life, that
directs and demands in an individual fashion. But the Self also insists
that the ego take responsibility within the limits that are set for it. The

22 -- Persona -- 22

wisdom of life lies in discovering where individual will and choice can
operate, where limitations and responsibility begin and end.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. You are able to make your own decisions: you can "stand on your own two
feet." Rely now upon your own resources and initiative. (Could be a test.)
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one adorning his beard.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Lends grace to the beard on his chin.

Blofeld: He adorns his beard.

Liu: He decorates his beard.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning: one's hair-growing.

Shaughnessy: Making luxurious his beard.

Cleary (1): Adornment is seeking.

Wu: He adorns his beard.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He rouses himself to action only along with the subject of
the line above. Wilhelm/Baynes: He ascends with the one above. Blofeld:
He does so in order to be able to take part in the enjoyments of his superiors.
[There are times when it is wise to conform with the customs of our seniors,
even if we attach little value to them.] Ritsema/Karcher: Associating-with the
above, rising indeed. Cleary (2): Adornment is seeking, in the sense of rising
with those who are higher. Wu: He wants to advance with the one above.

Legge: Line two is magnetic and in its proper place, but with no proper
correlate above. The dynamic third line is similarly situated. Therefore they stick
together and are as the beard and the chin. What is substantial commands and
rules what is merely ornamental.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man seeks adornment for its own sake, without regard to his inner
spiritual qualities, which it should enhance.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Wing: Grace for its own sake is worthless to you now. It is merely an adornment.
If you pay more attention to the vessel than to what it contains, you will entirely
miss the meaning of this moment.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Nothing in itself should be
cultivated that is not somehow prepared to subordinate itself to meaning.

Editor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. In my
experience neither the Siu nor Wing paraphrases reflect the deeper meaning of
this line. Note that Wilhelm's "paraphrase" from his Lectures on the I Ching
is not exactly analogous to either of them. In his regular commentary he states:
"The third line is the chin and the second is, as it were, merely its appendage.
The upward movement that evokes grace takes place in the two lines together.
The yielding element can adorn the strong, but cannot add to it an independent
quality. This line has significance only in the hexagram taken as a whole; in its
individual aspect it is not especially important. (pg 497)” The beard, an
"ornament" which conceals the chin which shapes it, suggests the concept of the
Persona: The mask that hides the face is analogous to the beard that hides the
chin. As suggested by Blofeld's note on the Confucian commentary, in some
situations the line can assume a meaning analogous to Matthew 22:21 --
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the
things that are God's” or even: "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." (There
are times when the Work could be harmed if unprotected by a facade.)

We have to become aware of ourselves as individuals; apart from the
external demands made upon us, we have to acquire a sense of
responsibility and a capacity for judgment which are not necessarily
identical with external collective expectations and standards, though of
course these standards must be given due regard. We have to discover
that we use our representational clothes for protection and appearance
but that we can also change into something more comfortable when it is
appropriate and can be naked at other times. If our clothes stick to us or
seem to replace our skin we are likely to be come ill.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Form follows function.

B. You are only an appendage to a larger reality. Follow what is best in you.

C. Sometimes it is necessary for the substantive to be concealed by the trivial.

D. Sometimes the substantive gives shape to the trivial.
22 -- Persona -- 22
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject with the appearance of being
adorned and bedewed with rich favors. But let him ever maintain his firm
correctness, and there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Graceful and moist. Constant perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: His adornments are such that he appears to glisten -- righteous
determination maintained up to the very end brings good fortune.

Liu: Decoration with moisture. If you continue, you will have good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning thus, soaking thus. Perpetual Trial significant.

Shaughnessy: Luxuriantly, glossily; permanent determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Adorned and luxuriant, perpetual rectitude is auspicious.

Cleary (2): Adorned, luxuriant, perpetual righteousness bodes well.

Wu: He appears to have adorned and moisturized himself. Perseverance will
bring good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If he maintains his firm correctness, in the end no one will
insult him. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune of constant perseverance
cannot, in the end, be put to shame. Blofeld: This implies that, to the very end,
no one will thwart our purposes. Ritsema/Karcher: Perpetual Trial's
significance. Completing absolutely-nothing: having a mound indeed. Cleary
(2): No one can ever slight you. Wu: No one would dare to humiliate him.

Legge: The third line is dynamic, and between two magnetic lines which adorn
and bestow their favors on him. But this happy condition is due to the accident of
place -- he must maintain his correctness to ensure its continuance. It is not
ornament, but correct firmness which secures the respect of others.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is enjoying a charmed life, and is given many honors. He should
guard against convivial indolence and be aware of its consequences.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Wing: You are in a moment of perfect grace, living a charmed existence. Do not
allow such good fortune to make you indolent, for this would bring unhappiness.
Continue to persevere in your endeavors and principles.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): When form and its meaning
penetrate each other completely, when the work of art is rendered totally
transparent, this is only a transitory state, which will necessarily pass.

Editor: The image suggests that circumstances are in your favor, though they
may not be due to any particular virtue on your part. Following Wilhelm's insight
(see his commentary on the preceding line), that the second and third places in
this hexagram are closely interdependent, a Jungian interpretation of their
alliance suggests itself: line 2 being the Persona and line 3 being the Ego through
which it acts as conditions require. This implies that ego and persona are here
coordinated with the Self's agenda -- even if that may be unclear at the moment.

For someone who adheres to [the goal of the knowledge of God] will not
be moved to decorate walls with gold or to put a gold border on his
garment – unless he intends thereby to give delight to his soul for the
sake of its health and to drive sickness from it, so that it will be clear and
pure to receive the sciences.
Maimonides

A. You're sitting pretty -- don't blow it!
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows one looking as if adorned, but only in
white. As if mounted on a white horse, and furnished with wings, she seeks
union with the subject of the first line, while the intervening third pursues, not as
a robber, but intent on a matrimonial alliance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Grace or simplicity? A white horse comes as if on wings. He
is not a robber, he will woo at the right time.

Blofeld: He so adorns himself as to seem white as snow. He is, as it were, a
white steed. What delays his progress is not an obstacle but a matter of betrothal.

Liu: Simple decoration. A white horse comes as though flying. Not a robber, but
a suitor.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning thus, hoary thus. A white horse, soaring thus. In-
no-way outlawry, matrimonial allying.

Shaughnessy: Luxuriantly, lushly, the white horse is lofty-like; it is not the
robbers who confusedly slander.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Cleary (1): Adorned or plain? A white horse runs swiftly. It is not an enemy but
a mate. [It is best if one finds what is right when one is weak; the true heart and
genuine intention come forth spontaneously, not forced – when there is no
enmity or injury, then it is desirable to seek partnership. This is the adornment
of the weak seeking clarity.]

Cleary (2): Adorned plainly, a white horse runs swiftly. They are not enemies
but partners.

Wu: He adorns himself in white like a white horse with wings. He is a suitor, not
a transgressor.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The place occupied by the fourth line affords ground for
doubt as to its subject. But because the third line pursues not as a robber, but
intent on marriage, she will in the end have no grudge against him.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The fourth place is in doubt; this accords with its place. "He
is not a robber, he will woo at the right time.” In the end, one remains free of
blame. Blofeld: This ruling line indicates the existence of suspicion; however, as
revealed by the last sentence, nothing blameworthy is involved. [It would seem
that someone is suspected of loitering or hesitating for a somewhat sinister
reason, but that his motive is in fact an honorable one.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Appropriate situation to doubt indeed. In- no-way outlawry, matrimonial allying.
Completing without surpassing indeed. Cleary (2): The fourth (magnetic line),
in its place, doubts. They are not enemies but partners, and ultimately have no
grudge. Wu: If he is a suitor, not a transgressor, he will have nothing to worry
about at all.

Legge: Line four has its proper correlate in line one, from whose strength she
should receive adornment. But lines two and three intervene and keep them
apart so that the only adornment is white. The fourth line is faithful to line one
however, and desires their union. Finally line three appears in a good character,
and not with the purpose to injure, so that the union between one and four takes
place. All this in intended to show how adornment recognizes the superiority of
solidity. Compare hexagram lines 3:2 and 38:6. Because of their separation we
might doubt how far line four would remain loyal to line one. The loyalty is
insured through the character and object of line three.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is faced with the choice between a life of brilliance and one of
simplicity. All considerations suggest simplicity. Renouncing potential comforts
may seem disappointing at first, but peace of mind will be attained through
proper relationship with the sincere supporter.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Wing: You have a choice of two paths. One is the path of adornment and
external brilliance; the other is the path of simplicity and inner worth. Your
considerations suggest a deeper connection with your true Self. The path of
simplicity will lead to more meaningful relationships with others and greater self-
knowledge.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Here is the point where life is silent
for a moment, and now the decision must be made how to continue shaping life.

Editor: There are three main ideas here -- first, the idea of being "adorned in
white." Clothing symbolizes the opinions and attitudes which "adorn" our
personality. To be dressed in white therefore, is to be simple and unpretentious –
the opposite of complexity and ostentation.

Second, the image of a flying white horse. This suggests purified (white) psychic
energy (horsepower) united with the wings of intellectual aspiration. Wings
enable entities to fly in the air -- symbolically, the realm of thought. We are
immediately reminded of Pegasus, and although we can assume that the Duke of
Chou knew nothing of Pegasus, the symbolic associations are not irrelevant here.
Pegasus is associated in Greek mythology with the Muses -- the sources of
creativity and inspiration.

The third idea is of marriage -- the conjunction of masculine and feminine in a
holy union or hieros gamos: the creative synthesis of thought and feeling within
the psyche. However, the suitor can't unite with the subject of the line until all
confusion has been eliminated from the situation. He is perceived as a "robber"
because the barriers to union must be removed ("stolen") before the alliance can
take place: in other words, an illusion prevails.

This line (and indeed the entire hexagram) is often received in answer to
questions concerning creativity or the creative process. If this is the only
changing line, the new hexagram created is number thirty, Clarity.

I discriminate between the ordinary ego-consciousness of the man and
his creative personality. Very often there is a striking difference.
Personally a creative man can be an introvert, but in his work he is an
extravert and vice versa.
Jung -- Letters

A. You don't understand the matter at hand. Unseen forces are working toward
unity however, and clarity will eventually dawn.

B. The image suggests the gestation of a creative idea.

C. Don't complicate the situation -- a creative solution will mature in the course
of time.
22 -- Persona -- 22
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject adorned by the occupants of
the heights and gardens. She bears her roll of silk, small and slight. She may
appear stingy, but there will be good fortune in the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Grace in hills and gardens. The roll of silk is meager and
small. Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.

Blofeld: Elegantly he strolls amidst the garden of hillocks, but his silk girdle is
of the poorest quality -- disgrace followed ultimately by good fortune. [The
Chinese love landscape gardens. Here, obviously, someone improperly dressed
is visiting a person of consequence and has to suffer for his carelessness. This
should be taken figuratively to indicate a setback due to our own carelessness.
Fortunately all ends well.]

Liu: Decoration in hills and gardens. A small roll of silk. Humiliation, then good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Adorning tending-towards a hill-top garden. Rolled plain-
silk: little, little. Abashment. Completing significant.

Shaughnessy: Luxuriant in the mound garden; the bolt of silk is so
fragmentary; distress; in the end auspicious.

Cleary (1): Adornment in the hills and groves, the roll of silk is small; there is
shame, but it turns out well.

Cleary (2): ... There is regret, but the end is auspicious.

Wu: He adorns himself with ragged cloth in a hillside garden. He appears
parsimonious, but will have good fortune in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune falling to the fifth line affords occasion for
joy. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune of the [fifth line] has joy. Blofeld:
This good fortune comes in the form of blessings. ["Blessings" implies good
fortune which comes, as it were, by chance and not obviously as a result of our
own merits or efforts.] Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing rejoicing indeed. Cleary
(2): There is joy. Wu: His good fortune comes with jubilation.

Legge: Line five is in the place of honor, but has no proper correlate in line two.
She therefore associates with the dynamic line six above her, symbolized by the
heights and gardens around a city which serve to both protect and to beautify it.
Thus the subject of the line receives adornment from without, and does not of
22 -- Persona -- 22

herself try to manifest it. Moreover, in her weakness, her offerings of ceremony
are poor and mean. But, as Confucius said: "In ceremonies it is better to be
sparing than extravagant." Hence stinginess doesn't prevent a good auspice. The
K'ang-hsi editors say: "Line five occupies the place of honor, yet prefers
simplicity and exalts economy. She might change and transform manners and
customs." It is a small matter to say of her that she affords occasion for joy.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man meets someone whom he wishes to befriend and feels ashamed at
his meager gifts. But his natural sincerity overcomes the difficulties and good
fortune ensues.

Wing: You may wish to strengthen your connection with someone you admire,
but you feel that what you have to offer is not grand enough to merit attention.
However, your internal desires and sincere feelings of friendliness are all that
truly matter. Your worth will be recognized and you will meet with good fortune.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Thus Tao and law are also found
where man, the personal element, the human mask, as it were, is no longer
visible.

Editor: The theme of Persona here contrasts “simplicity” with Haute Couture

    I visualize a ragged Taoist sage in the emperor’s palace garden. Stingy, small,
    meager, plain, ragged, parsimonious, all suggest some sort of impoverishment.
    To be “adorned” by “poverty” can suggest a morally superior but weak position in
    relationship to a strong one: the intimidating “hills and gardens” of the
    aristocracy which define the situation. Thus: your position is weak but correct
    and should prevail if you serve the Tao. There is also the idea of a small but
    sincere sacrifice which brings an eventual reward in excess of the original
    offering. The alliance with the top line suggests a connection with superior forces
    from whom, despite our humble station, we are adorned via our inner grace.

[Jesus] sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting
money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in a great deal. A poor
widow came and put in two small coins, the equivalent of a penny. Then
he called his disciples and said to them, "I tell you solemnly, this poor
widow has put more in than all who have contributed to the treasury;
for they have all put in money they had over, but she from the little she
has put in everything she possessed, all she had to live on."
Mark 12: 41-44

A. Less is more.

B. A small sacrifice is appropriate. The reward will exceed the loss.
22 -- Persona -- 22
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows one with white as his only ornament.
There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Simple grace. No blame.

Blofeld: Simple elegance. No error!

Liu: Simple decoration. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: White adorning. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: White luxury; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Adornment by simplicity is impeccable.

Wu: He is unadorned and there will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The line shows how he has attained his aim. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The one above attains his will. Blofeld: This top line indicates the
fulfillment of our will. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring purpose above indeed.
Cleary (2): One attains one’s aspiration above. Wu: His aspiration has
prevailed.

Legge: At the top of the hexagram ornament has run its course and there is a
return to pure white simplicity. Substantiality is better than ornament. The
subject of the sixth line shows more of the spirit of the hexagram than most. His
being clothed in simple white crowns the lesson that ornament must be kept in a
secondary place.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man reaches the peak of his development, and displays perfect grace
through the true expression of his character without pretensions. He understands
the patterns of human frailties.

Wing: You can rely now upon the sincerity of your true nature to supply your
external radiance. Pretensions, form, and adornments are no longer necessary to
achieve your aims. Simplicity is the path you must take. In this way you will make
no mistakes.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): Highest spirituality is connected
with complete absence of outward pretense.
22 -- Persona -- 22

Editor: Questions concerning artistic creativity are sometimes addressed by this
line -- differentiating the intent of the muse (Self) from the ambitions of the artist
(ego). We are reminded of the difference between unity and multiplicity -- unity
being one simple whole, multiplicity being many diverse complexities or
"ornaments."

Only the truly intelligent understand this principle of the leveling of all
things into One. They discard the distinctions and take refuge in the
common and ordinary things. The common and ordinary things serve
certain functions and therefore retain the wholeness of nature. From this
wholeness, one comprehends, and from comprehension, one comes near
to Tao. There one stops. To stop without knowing how one stops -- this is
Tao.
Chuangtse

A. "Keep it simple."

23 -- Disintegration -- 23
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-THREE –
DISINTEGRATION

Other titles: Splitting Apart, The symbol of Falling or Flaying, Peeling Off,
Decay, Flaying, Stripping Away, Intrigue, Deterioration, Collapse, Fracturing,
Tearing, Disintegration, Ruin, Unraveling, "Can refer to a physical parting.
Making a secure foundation." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Disintegration means that it is not advantageous to make a movement
in any direction whatever.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Splitting Apart. It does not further one to go anywhere.

Blofeld: Peeling off. At present, there is no goal (or destination) which can be
sought with advantage. [Peeling off in the sense of getting rid of hindrances (or
hinderers) one after another. The first four lines of this hexagram symbolize a
process of ridding ourselves progressively of all those upon whom we are
accustomed to rely, for the powers of darkness are in the ascendant and no one
can be trusted. However, in the long run, virtue triumphs, as indicated by line
five, and ultimately we are all the more esteemed for our steadfastness, as can
be seen from line six.]

Liu: Decay. It is unfavorable to undertake anything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stripping not Harvesting: possessing directed going.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of something outmoded or
worn out. It emphasizes that eliminating what has become unusable is the
adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Flaying: Not beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): Stripping away does not make it beneficial to go anywhere.

Cleary (2): ... It is not beneficial, etc.

Wu: Tearing indicates that it is not advantageous to have any undertaking.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

The Image

Legge: The image of a mountain adhering to the earth forms Disintegration.
Superiors therefore strengthen their inferiors to secure the peace and stability of
their own position.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The mountain rests on the earth: the image of Splitting
Apart. Thus those above can ensure their position only by giving generously to
those below.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a mountain resting upon the earth. The
truly great shower generosity upon those under them to enable them to live in
peace and comfort. [The upper and lower trigrams, mountain and Earth,
symbolize the Superior Man and the people in his care.]

Liu: The mountain stands on the earth, symbolizing Decay. Those above
should act with benevolence toward those below. Then there will be peace and
security.

Ritsema/Karcher: Mountain adjoining with-respect-to earth. Stripping.
Using munificence above to quiet the position below.

Cleary (1): Mountains are joined to the earth. Those above secure their homes
by kindness to those below.

Wu: The mountain is subordinated to the earth; this is Tearing .Thus those
above treat those below with liberal rewards to secure their own positions.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Disintegration means overthrowing or being overthrown:
the magnetic lines attack the dynamic line at the top in order to change it into one
of themselves. It is unwise to move in any direction because inferior elements are
now increasing in power. The superior man, observing this, stops all forward
movement. He defers to the exigency of the time, realizing that increase and
decrease, ripeness and decay are cyclic rhythms.

Legge: Disintegration is the symbol of falling or causing to fall, and refers to
the process of decay or overthrow in both the natural and political worlds. The
figure consists of five yin lines below and one yang line on top. Decay has begun
at the bottom and crept upward. The hexagram symbolizes the ninth month
when summer has passed and the year is about to fall into the sterile arms of
winter. In the political world, inferior men have gradually displaced good men
until only one remains. The lesson for him is to wait because the power operating
against him is too strong. Eventually a change for the better will appear. The
specific image is that of a bed and its occupant, and the symbolism describes the
attempts made to overthrow him. The lower trigram of Docility and the upper
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

trigram of Keeping Still suggest to the superior man of line six how he can best
deal with the prevailing circumstances. The situation is not hopeless -- winter is
followed by spring, night by day, and the waning moon soon grows full again. So
will it be in the course of human affairs.

The idea behind the Image is that a mountain has the earth for its foundation. If
the earth is thick, the mountain preserves its height. So it is with the sovereign
and people.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Disintegration means do not act.

The Superior Man stabilizes his responses and seeks tranquility.

The twenty-third hexagram is the inverse of Return, the hexagram immediately
following it. Each figure depicts an opposite pole in a cyclic progression. Here
the old cycle has disintegrated to the point of dissolution. The following
hexagram depicts the Return to the beginning of a new cycle.

The first four lines of Disintegration show the gradual erosion of a position or
frame of reference, symbolized by a bed or couch. The inferior forces creep up
from below like termites to undermine a solid foundation. The fifth line shows a
gathering of forces for a potentially positive transformation, and the top line
suggests the first stages of this transformation. The implication is that times of
disintegration needn't always be regarded as negative, or a foregone conclusion.
We still have the choice to alter conditions in our favor.

That the superior man "strengthens his inferiors" to insure the stability of his
position, means that one stabilizes one's psychological situation by defusing the
causes of rebellion -- safeguard the foundation where it is weak. Hexagram
number forty-three, Resoluteness, is a negative picture of this figure, and the
message in the Image is very similar: "The superior man does not hoard his
wealth, but shares it with his subordinates." The idea is subtle -- it doesn't mean
to indulge your weaknesses, but to monitor them encouragingly so that they may
become transformed into positive forces.

Whenever we go deep enough toward the core of a sub- personality, we
find that the core -- which is some basic urge, or need -- is good. For
practical purposes, this can be considered an absolute. No matter how
many layers of distortion may surround it, the basic need, the basic
motivation, is a good one -- and if it becomes twisted, it was because of
not being able to express itself directly. The real core -- not what the sub-
personality wants, but what it needs -- is good. A basic purpose of the
coordination phase is to discover this central urge or need, to make it
conscious, and to find acceptable ways in which it can be satisfied and
fulfilled. And, provided we have sufficient understanding and skill, it can

23 -- Disintegration -- 23

be satisfied -- if not fully, at least enough to maintain the process of
growth.
James Vargiu -- Subpersonalities

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows one overturning the couch by injuring its
legs. The injury will go on to the destruction of all firm correctness, and there
will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The leg of the bed is split. Those who persevere are
destroyed. Misfortune.

Blofeld: He starts the peeling off at the foot of the bed. There is no
steadfastness -- misfortune!

Liu: The legs of the bed are rotting. If one continues despite this, misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stripping the bed, using the stand. Discarding the Trial:
pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Flaying the good together with the legs; determination about the
military is inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Stripping a bed of the legs, destroying rectitude brings misfortune.

Cleary (2): ... Destroying uprightness, etc.

Wu: He tears down the legs of the bed. Without regard to what is correct, it will
be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Thus she commences her work of ruin with what is lowest in
the superior man. Wilhelm/Baynes: "The leg of the bed is split," in order to
destroy those below. Blofeld: This implies ridding ourselves of those below.
[Because he finds them unworthy. What is said in the various lines about the
foot, edge and mattress of the bed means that he is obliged to continue the
peeling off process until he reaches those very close to himself; there is no one
left whom he can trust to help him in his work of righteousness.] Ritsema/
Karcher: Below using submerging indeed. Cleary (2): (He) is destroying the
foundation. [In contemplating mind, this refers to removing the foundation of
discipline.] Wu: He destroys the underpinning.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

Legge: The attempt in line one is made by commencing with the legs of the
couch. The symbolism goes on to explain itself. The object of the evil worker is
the overthrow of all firm correctness. Of course there will be evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the superior men around the ruler are being undermined by
the slander and intrigue of inferior men on their destructive path. All that can be
done is to be patient while the evil continues.

Wing: Your position is being undermined. Persons of inferior persuasions have
entered the situation from below and are creating an environment for
Deterioration. The time bodes evil for persons of integrity. All you can do is
patiently wait.

Editor: A bed is a resting place, a context or matrix, as “the bed of a river.” The
legs of the bed are its support, or foundation. Thus, the injury or disintegration of
the legs is synonymous with "not having a leg to stand on." The image suggests
the destruction of a fundamental premise which is essential for correct behavior.

That a bed signifies doctrine, is from correspondence, for as the body
rests in its bed, so does the mind rest in its doctrine.
Swedenborg

A. Your assumptions are unfounded -- to continue in error brings unfortunate
consequences.

B. Destructive forces are active -- to pursue your present course is to feed their
intent.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one overthrowing the couch by injuring
its frame. The injury will go on to the destruction of all firm correctness, and
there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The bed is split at the edge. Those who persevere are
destroyed. Misfortune.

Blofeld: He continues peeling off at the edge of the bed. There is no
steadfastness -- misfortune!

Liu: The frame of the bed is rotting. If one continues despite this, misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stripping the bed, using marking-off. Discarding the Trial:
pitfall.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

Shaughnessy: Flaying the good together with the dividers; determination about
the military is inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Stripping a bed of its frame, destroying rectitude brings misfortune.

Cleary (2): ... Destroying uprightness, etc.

Wu: He strips away the panels of the bed. Without regard to what is correct, it
will be foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The superior man has as yet no associates. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One has no comrade. Blofeld: This implies being left without friends.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet possessing associating indeed. Cleary (2): There
is nothing to work with. Wu: He does not have a responsive correlate.

Legge: line two has the same effect as line one, except that the foe has advanced
from the legs to the frame of the couch.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The inferior men grow stronger. No help is in sight. Great caution and
stubborn adherence to personal convictions are required.

Wing: The time requires the utmost caution. You are without allies in a
compromising situation. Adapt as best you can to the circumstances. Do not take
a self-righteous position or you could be badly hurt.

Editor: The legs are what the bed stands upon; the frame is what defines its
perimeter. Line two therefore suggests the destruction of a definition which is
essential to a doctrine, belief or discipline. For example, a basic tenet of
Alcoholics Anonymous is the idea that each member must abstain entirely from
alcohol. To expand the rules to permit the consumption of one ounce of alcohol
per day would be to "overthrow the couch" -- the entire concept of what
Alcoholics Anonymous is would be destroyed by including such an idea in its
framework. Sometimes receiving this line is a simple acknowledgment that an
old viewpoint or belief was inadequate -- in which case it needed to be destroyed.

As long as soul stays true to itself, it loves the divinity and desires to be at
one with it, as a daughter loves with noble love a noble father. When,
however, the soul has come down here to human birth, it exchanges (as if
deceived by the false promises of an adulterous lover) its divine love for
one that is mortal. And then, far from its begetter, the soul yields to all
manner of excess.
Plotinus

23 -- Disintegration -- 23

A. Suggests a situation with weak or disintegrating boundaries.

B. Conclusions based on faulty premises are worthless. Rationalization may be a
factor.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject among the over-throwers; but
there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He splits with them. No blame.

Blofeld: He peels them all off -- no error.

Liu: Falling apart. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stripping it, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Flaying; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Stripping away without fault.

Wu: He tears but he is blameless.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: That there will be no error on the part of this one among
the over-throwers arises from the difference between her and the others above
and below. Wilhelm/Baynes: He loses the neighbor above and the one below.
Blofeld: This implies losing contact with those above and below. Ritsema/
Karcher: Letting-go Above and Below indeed. Cleary (2): Loses above and
below. Wu: He is not associated with those around him.

Legge: Line three also represents an over-thrower, but it differs from the others
by being the correlate of line six, who is her ally. Three's allegiance is to the sixth
line and not, as with the other magnetic lines, to one of her own kind.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Because of circumstances beyond his control, the man finds himself
associating with evil men. His inner relationship with a superior man enables
him to retain his righteous stability, leading to opposition from inferior people.

Wing: Circumstances have led you into a situation in which you must work with
inferior persons or ideals. If you can, nevertheless, maintain a strong tie with a
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

superior element, you will avoid Deterioration and free yourself of regretful
errors.

Editor: Wilhelm says: "He splits with them." Blofeld renders it: "He peels them
all off." These are images of separation or differentiation -- a setting apart.
Disintegration is an upside-down image of the hexagram of Return, and if it
is inverted, this line takes the place of line four in Return: "Walking in the
midst of others, one returns alone." Wu's Confucian commentary on line three
here says: “He is not associated with those around him,” which reinforces this
idea.

The disintegrating tendencies very often result in psychosis if the
unconscious and conscious clash, for then they have prevailed and the
person falls into all those parts which are hostile to each other, as, for
instance, when the psychotic person hears different voices which quarrel
with each other. On the other hand, we know also that the unconscious
contains synthesizing or integrating tendencies, which issue from that
regulating center which Jung calls the Self.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. Make a distinction between yourself and inferior elements within the situation,
perhaps an attitude.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject having overthrown the
couch, and going on to injure the skin of him who lies on it. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The bed is split up to the skin. Misfortune.

Blofeld: He continues the peeling off at the mattress of his bed -- misfortune!

Liu: The entire bed rots, reaching the body. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stripping the bed, using flesh. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Flaying the good together with the skin; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Stripping away even the skin on the bed, misfortune.

Cleary (2): Stripping a bed to the skin brings misfortune.

Wu: He rips off the matting in the bed. There will be foreboding.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Calamity is very near at hand. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is a
serious and immediate misfortune. Blofeld: This presages our being very close
to a terrible misfortune. Ritsema/Karcher: Slicing close-to calamity indeed.
Cleary (2): Getting very close to disaster. Wu: The danger is imminent.

Legge: Danger is imminent. The bed has been overthrown. The person of the
occupant is at the mercy of the destroyers.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Calamity is imminent. Neither warning nor protection is forthcoming. The
man is at the mercy of destroyers.

Wing: You are exposed to danger. Calamity is imminent and you are unable to
hold it back. Without warning, you are on the threshold of defeat.

Editor: This is one of the most negative lines in the I Ching -- an image of
maximum destruction. Legge’s translation suggests that the dynamic sixth line
may be regarded as the bed’s symbolic occupant -- i.e., it's his skin which is being
flayed. Psychologically interpreted, this can suggest the Self which is in some
sense em-bed-ed in its satellite complexes.

Even at the height of [Hitler's] power there was for him no Germany,
there were no German troops for whom he felt himself responsible; for
him there was -- at first sub-consciously, but in his last years fully
consciously -- only one greatness, a greatness which dominated his life
and to which his evil genius sacrificed everything -- his own ego.
Colonel-General Franz Halder

A. You are destroying the Work.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject leading on the others like a
string of fishes, and obtaining for them the favor that lights on the inmates of the
palace. There will be advantage in every way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A shoal of fishes. Favor comes through the court ladies.
Everything acts to further.

Blofeld: A string of fishes symbolizing the high favor enjoyed by maids in the
palace -- everything is favorable. [This line seems somewhat to contradict the
omen provided by this unlucky hexagram. In such cases, what is said in the
moving line must be regarded as specially apt for our particular circumstances;
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

i.e. in spite of the wretched conditions prevailing, those who receive this moving
line can pursue their goals without fear of failure.]

Liu: A string of fish. Favor comes through women of the palace. Everything is
good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Threading fish. Using housing people, favor. Without
not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Strung fish; eating the palace men's steamer; there is nothing
not beneficial.

Cleary (1): Leading fish, gaining favor through court ladies; beneficial in every
respect.

Cleary (2): Leading fish with the favor shown to court ladies, there is all-around
benefit.

Wu: Like a school of fish, the court ladies are led in to gain the royal favor.
Everything will be fine.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the end there will be no grudge against her. Wilhelm/
Baynes: In the end this is not a mistake. Blofeld: This implies that ultimately
we shall be entirely free from blame. Ritsema/Karcher: Completing without
surpassing indeed. Cleary (2): In the end there is no grudge. Wu: There will be
no resentment in the end.

Legge: With line five the symbolism changes. She is the ruler of all the other
magnetic lines who are at her disposal. They are imaged as fishes (which come
under the category of yin), following each other as if strung together. The ruler of
these yin lines is loyal to the yang sixth line, the rightful sovereign in his palace,
and she leads the others to him to enjoy his favors. The K'ang-hsi editors say:
"The magnetic fifth line occupies the most honorable place in the figure. She is a
queen who leads her subjects to obtain the favors given to the inmates of the
palace. She has no jealousy or other vice which seeks to overthrow the ruler."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The dark forces undergo change, yielding to the strong influence of the
basic goodness of men.

Wing: An inferior situation is beginning to change for the better. Through co-
operation, opposing forces can come together for mutual benefit. There is now a
possibility for success in your endeavors.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

Editor: This is an image of an intermediate power organizing inferior powers to
lend support to (or obtain favors from) a superior power. Psychologically
interpreted, one can think of ego, archetypal complexes and Self, respectively.

The governor of a circle is of course its center, around which everything
revolves. In the psyche likewise, the center is ruler of the entire man. In
the conscious realm the ego is master, but in this larger sphere the ego is
only one voice among many. The ruler here must transcend the ego. It
must be a suprapersonal value that can command the allegiance and
obedience of the ego, just as the ego, through the development of
consciousness, comes to transcend the [archetypal complexes]. This ruler
Jung has called the Self.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. An approaching synthesis. Disparate forces are brought under control.

B. Insights present themselves for contemplation.

C. Contemplate what is wrong in the situation and integrate your forces.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject as a great fruit which has not
been eaten. The superior man finds the people again as a chariot carrying him.
The inferior men by their course overthrow their own dwellings.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is a large fruit still uneaten. The superior man
receives a carriage. The house of the inferior man is split apart.

Blofeld: The ripe fruit remains uneaten. [Few care to accept advice or help,
although the Superior Man will gladly give it them.] The Superior Man will
acquire a carriage, whereas the mean man will lose his own house. [This line
presages great good fortune for the truly virtuous; for, in the end, their virtue is
widely recognized and men rally to their support. On the other hand, those who
hitherto have managed to obtain good fortune through dishonest methods
pursued at a time when virtue as under an eclipse will lose everything they
have.]

Liu: A large fruit not eaten. The superior man acquires a carriage. The inferior
man's house falls apart.

Ritsema/Karcher: The ripe fruit not taken in. A chun tzu acquiring a cart.
Small People Stripping the hut.

Shaughnessy: The stone fruit is not eaten: the gentleman obtains a chariot the
little man flays a gourd.
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

Cleary (1): A hard fruit is not eaten. The superior person gets a vehicle. The
inferior person is stripped of a house.

Cleary (2): ... The leader gets a vehicle. The petty person, etc.

Wu: The grand fruit is not picked for eating. The jun zi gains a carriage. The little
men tear down their shelters. [This is the lone yang line in the hexagram, like a
big fruit not yet picked. Translation: the only remaining yang not stripped off
by the yin. Here is the jun zi [chun tzu, superior man] who has the support of the
people. Despite temporary setbacks, goodness prevails in the end.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The superior man finds himself in a carriage: he is carried
along by the people. The inferior men have over-thrown their own dwellings,
which can never again be of use to them. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is carried by
the people. "The house of the inferior man is split apart": he ends up as useless.
Blofeld: The carriage symbolizes the support of the people. The mean wretch
who loses his house is ultimately found useless for anything. Ritsema/
Karcher: Commoners: the place to carry indeed. Completing, not permitting
availing-of indeed. Cleary (2): The leader (is) carried by the people. The small
person is after all unsuitable for employment. Wu: Because the people support
him. Because they have destroyed their own usefulness.

Legge: The dynamic sixth line, notwithstanding the attempts against him,
survives and acquires fresh vigor. The people again cherish their sovereign, and
the plotters have wrought to their own destruction.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The evil finally brings about its own demise, and good times return.
The man acquires fresh vigor, and the sovereign is strengthened by public
support.

Wing: The forces of Deterioration have ended. The power will return to
persons of worthwhile vision, who will again win the support of others. Inferior
persons are destroyed by their own evil, for without power, negativity is self-
consuming.

Editor: Fruit: Generally, the results of any action, either good or bad: An accrual
of Karma. "By their fruits ye shall know them." (The context here being
favorable.) Chariot: A vehicle, means of progress, way of going. It can symbolize
the psyche as the vehicle of evolution. Here, the superior man (or Self) has a "new
way of going." People: "(Symbolic of) the lower mental and emotional qualities;
the natural undeveloped instincts and activities which are to be disciplined and
used as a means to the end of the manifestation of the Self." [Gaskell --
23 -- Disintegration -- 23

Dictionary of Scriptures and Myths]. Dwelling: in the symbolism of this
line, the dwellings of the inferior men are the focal points of autonomous,
unregenerate forces within the psyche: desires, appetites, etc. But now these foci
are overthrown, so the inferior forces no longer "have a home." Generally
speaking, this line tells us that the time of disintegration has passed or will soon
change for the better. As Legge points out in his commentary on the hexagram:
"The situation is not hopeless -- winter is followed by spring, night by day, and
the waning moon soon grows full again. So will it be in the course of human
affairs."

Happy is the virtuous man, for he will feed on the fruit of his deeds; Woe
to the wicked, evil is on him, he will be treated as his actions deserve.
Isaiah 3: 10-11

A. The consequences of past actions have yet to manifest themselves, or you have
yet to assimilate an insight concerning a natural separation of positive and
negative elements within the situation. However, a reorganization and new
synthesis of forces is imaged and stability is being re-established.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR –
RETURN

Other titles: The Turning Point, The Symbol of Returning, Revival, Recovery,
To Repeat, Renewal, Restore, Return to the Way, Cyclic Repetition, "Return to
virtue or happier conditions." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Progress and freedom of action are found in Return. Goings and
comings are unimpeded, and friends approach without error. Return to repeat
the proper course. Seven days returns the cycle to its beginning. There is
advantage in choosing one's path.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Return. Success. Going out and coming in without error.
Friends come without blame. To and fro goes the way. On the seventh day comes
return. It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

Blofeld: Return. Success! All going forth and coming in is free from harm.
[For it is only when the whole series is completed that we can understand the
reasons for many things (death, winter and so on) which, at the time, seemed
unproductive, negative or positively evil.] Friends arrive and no error is
involved. They return whence they came, spending seven days in all upon their
coming and returning. It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination).

Liu: Return: success. One goes out and comes back in without harm. Friends
arrive without blame. Going to and fro is the way. Returning on the seventh day.
It benefits one to go anywhere. [Return or Revival signifies a bad time becoming
better... Anyone receiving this hexagram should prepare for a great
opportunity...]

Ritsema/Karcher: Returning, Growing. Issuing-forth, entering, without
affliction. Partnering coming, without fault. Reversing Returning one's tao. The
seventh day coming: Returning. Harvesting: possessing directed going. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of something that is re-emerging. It
emphasizes that going back to the starting point in order to begin anew is the
adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the times you are told to
return!]

Shaughnessy: Returning: Receipt; in exiting and entering there is no illness;
when the burying comes there is no trouble; turning around and returning to its
way, in seven days it comes in return; beneficial to have someplace to go.
24 -- Return -- 24

Cleary (1): Return is developmental. Exiting and entering, there is no ill. When
a companion comes, there is no fault. Reversing the path, returning in seven
days, it is beneficial to have a place to go.

Cleary (2): Return is successful, etc. ... Returning back on the path, etc.

Wu: Renewal is pervasive. He who comes and goes will have no error. Friends
come without harm. The course repeats itself. In seven days, one cycle of
reversion completes. There will be advantage to have an undertaking.

The Image

Legge: Thunder in the middle of the earth -- the image of Return. Thus the
ancient kings closed the passes on the day of the winter solstice to prevent
travelers from pursuing their journeys, and princes from inspecting their states.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder within the earth: the image of The Turning
Point. Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes at the time of the solstice.
Merchants and strangers did not go about, and the ruler did not travel through
the provinces.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder in the bowels of the earth. [The
component trigrams in this position suggest thunder coming from under the
earth; but the trigram of thunder also means to sprout or quicken; it is this
concept of a quickening within the earth that makes this hexagram generally
favorable.] The ancient rulers closed the passes during the solstices [The solstices
were times for solemn sacrifice; it has always been the practice in China for
people to return to their homes for the celebration of the great yearly festivals.
Return in this sense is highly auspicious.] and the merchants were unable to
travel. Even the rulers abstained from touring their territories at those times.

Liu: Thunder in the earth symbolizes Return. Thus in ancient times the kings
closed the roads during the winter solstice. Merchants and travelers ceased
traveling. And rulers would not visit their territories.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder located-in earth center. Returning. The Earlier
Kings used culminating sun to bar the passages. Bargaining sojourners [used
culminating sun] not to move. The crown-prince [used culminating sun] not to
inspect on-all- sides.

Cleary (1): Thunder is in the earth; Return. Thus did the kings of yore shut the
gates on the winter solstice; caravans did not travel, the ruler did not inspect the
regions.

Wu: Thunder is inside the earth; this is Renewal. Thus on the day of the winter
solstice, the ancient kings ordered the city gates closed, so that merchants and
24 -- Return -- 24

travelers could take a break of their journeys; the kings refrained from
performing official duties.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Return shows the coming back of the dynamic principle.
His actions show movement directed in accordance with the natural order. Such
is the movement of the heavenly cycle. The dynamic lines are growing and
increasing. Do we not see in Return the mind of heaven and earth?

Legge: Return symbolizes the idea of coming back or over again. The previous
hexagram showed the ascendancy of inferior forces, when all that is good in
nature or society yields before what is bad. But change is eternal, and here we see
the beginnings of recovery from the former situation. Return is associated with
the time of the winter solstice when the sun begins its journey back toward
summer. In harmony with these cycles in nature are the cycles in human affairs.

The dynamic bottom line is the first line of the trigram of Movement, and
the upper trigram is that of Docility. The dynamic returning line will meet with
no resistance and all the magnetic lines above it will be transformed into allies.
The bright quality will be developed brighter and brighter from day to day and
month to month.

"In seven days brings return" refers to the idea of a new cycle
commencing when each of the six lines of a hexagram has changed -- the
"seventh line," or seventh day begins a new cycle just as Sunday begins a new
week.

Thunder in the midst of the earth is thunder shut up and silent, just able to
make its presence felt. So it is with the first stirrings of life after the winter
solstice and the first returning steps of the wanderer to virtue. As the spring of
life has to be nurtured in quietness, so also the purpose of goodness.

Wilhelm: The hexagram of RETURN, applied to character formation, contains
various suggestions. The light principle returns; thus the hexagram counsels
turning away from the confusion of external things, turning back to one’s inner
light. There, in the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One. It is indeed
only germinal, no more than a beginning, a potentiality, but as such clearly to be
distinguished from all objects. To know this One means to know oneself in
relation to the cosmic forces. For this One is the ascending force of life in nature
and in man.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The Work is recycled, perfected and refined over and over again.

The Superior Man pauses before he begins anew.
24 -- Return -- 24

The mention of seven days in the Judgment and the winter solstice in the
Image tells us that the hexagram of Return deals with cyclic progression.

In the I Ching, the hexagram fu, signifying the Return (one yang line
beneath five yin lines) is the symbol of the rebirth of the Yang. At the
winter solstice, the Yang seems to have disappeared, whereas the Yin is
at its full; but this is the moment when the Yang is reborn and begins its
return. Symmetrically, at the summer solstice the Yang is at the apogee
of its power while the Yin prepares to return. The alteration of the Yin
and the Yang is a going away and a coming back.
Max Kaltenmark -- Lao Tzu and Taoism

Seven days is one-quarter of a lunar cycle and the module upon which a
week is based. The Sabbath day is the seventh day and a day of rest in the
Hebrew tradition, as was also the day of the new moon. The "closing of the
passes" in the Image is another expression of the idea of resting at the beginning
of a new cycle. To refrain from activity at these times was a sacrifice and a
spiritual obligation. The concept behind it is the acknowledgment of one's
Source, a review of the past cycle and a meditation upon the new cycle just
beginning. Psychologically interpreted, forces in the unconscious psyche demand
a pause before their dance can resume.

A special atmosphere of solemn celebration surrounded the Sabbath,
which was thoroughly pervaded with Kabbalistic ideas about man's role
in the unification of the upper worlds.
Gershom Scholem -- Kabbalah

Although the Chinese observed no “Sabbath” that I am aware of, the idea
of a rest at the commencement of a cycle is clearly intended in this hexagram. In
terms of the Work, one eventually becomes aware of cycles and rest periods, even
if one never noticed them previously. When one learns how to synchronize
conscious awareness with these inner rhythms, the tempo of the Work begins to
accelerate.

"There is advantage in choosing one's path" is rendered by Wilhelm as: "It
furthers one to have somewhere to go." The idea is that when you are consciously
on a path, the cycles begin to work in your favor. Instead of a monotonous round
of inconclusive and random events, one's life takes on structure and purpose and
inner progress becomes discernable.

Conforming to the rhythm of the universe is the prerequisite of wisdom in
all Chinese thinking. But the Taoist mystic has greater ambitions than
his ordinary compatriots: the question for him is not merely of adapting
his ritual and hygienic observances to the alternation of the seasons; he
intends to escape from the determinism of life and death by transcending
it. This is what enables him to attain inner emptiness: he does not merely

24 -- Return -- 24

witness the return of all creatures to their origin, he precedes them to
that origin.
Max Kaltenmark -- Lao Tzu and Taoism

Every line of this hexagram refers to returning to the proper path, so the
hexagram can imply that perhaps you have strayed from the Work to one degree
or another. Without changing lines, it can mean to rest at the beginning of a
cycle, or to get back on course: re-attune yourself with the current phase of the
Work.

You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is
because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything
tries to be round. In the old days when we were a strong and happy
people, all our power came to us from the sacred hoop of the nation, and
so long as the hoop was unbroken, the people flourished.
Black Elk

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject returning from an error of no
great extent, which would not proceed to anything requiring repentance. There
will be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Return from a short distance. No need for remorse. Great
good fortune.

Blofeld: Returning from nearby -- nothing much to regret and sublime good
fortune!

Liu: Return from not far away. No remorse. Great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not distancing Returning. Without merely repenting.
Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Not returning from afar; there is no mention of regret; prime
auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): Returning not far; no regret.

Cleary (2): Returning not far, no regret, very auspicious.

Wu: He does not wander far from Return. There will be no cause for regret.
Great fortune.

COMMENTARY

24 -- Return -- 24

Confucius/Legge: Returning from an error of no great extent is the prelude to
the cultivation of the person. Wilhelm/Baynes: Thus one cultivates one's
character. Blofeld: Turning back before having gone too far is a means of self-
discipline. Ritsema/Karcher: Using adjusting individuality indeed. Cleary
(2): Returning that is not far is done by cultivating oneself. Wu: To return
before wandering far is a way of cultivating oneself.

The Master said: I may venture to say that the son of the Yen family
[Yen Hui, Confucius' favorite disciple] had nearly attained the standard of
perfection. If anything that he did was not good, he was sure to become
conscious of that; and when he knew it, he did not do the same thing again. As
is said in the I Ching, "The first line shows its subject returning from
an error that has not led him far away. There is no occasion for repentance.
There will be great good."

Legge: The subject of line one is the only dynamic line in the hexagram, meaning
here, says Ch'eng-tzu, "the way of the superior man." There must have been
some deviation from that, or "returning" could not be spoken of.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man returns to the original course of goodness after a
minor setback. There is no cause for remorse since the evil is put aside quickly.

Wing: You may be considering an idea that is by nature contrary to your
principles. Exercise self-discipline and hold to what you feel is right. In this way
you cultivate your character and will surely attain great things.

Editor: The line describes one who turns around immediately when he discovers
his error.

A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, to do
only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty may
suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion, if there is
any one at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from any opinion.
But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion,
as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like, not because it
appears pleasant or brings reputation.
Marcus Aurelius

A. Rectify a minor mistake.

B. Abandon an inferior action or attitude now before it causes serious
problems later on.
24 -- Return -- 24
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the admirable return of its subject.
There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Quiet return. Good fortune.

Blofeld: A return blessed by heaven -- good fortune!

Liu: Quiet return. Good fortune. [It benefits one to rely on an influential
person.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Relinquishing Returning. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Beneficent return; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Good return; auspicious.

Wu: He who admires Return will find auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to her condescension to the virtuous subject of
the line below. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune of a quiet return depends
on subordination to a good man. Blofeld: This good fortune results from our
treating others with loving-kindness. Ritsema/Karcher: Using humanity
below indeed. Cleary (2): Comes through humble benevolence. Wu: (This) is
due to his submission to the one having the love for mankind.

Legge: Line two is in its proper place and central, but it is magnetic. This is
more than compensated for by its adherence to line one -- the fifth line not being
a proper correlate. Hence her return is called excellent or admirable. The
virtuous subject of the first line is in line two called zhen, the "benevolent" or
"loving." It is the only case in all the symbolism of the I Ching where we find
that term used as an adjective. It is emphatic here for "Humanity" -- man in his
ideal state.
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man makes an admirable comeback through an act of self-mastery.
This is made easier by the example of a good man.

Wing: It is much easier to do the right thing when you are in good company.
Following good examples will lead you to success.

Editor: The meaning of the line is derived from its allegiance to line number
one. This can be interpreted as subordination to a high ideal or principle of
24 -- Return -- 24

integration. If we consider Legge's commentary on the concept of zhen as love in
the highest sense of unity/union, then the line suggests a return to a principle of
love, unity or even the Supreme Ultimate itself.

The world is moving in spirals, and our greatest modern philosophers
are nearing a place in their mental orbit where they come again into
conjunction with minds like Pythagoras and Plato.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

A. Suggests the tranquil subordination of ego to a higher principle.

B. Renounce your claim to action and return to the Work.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one who has made repeated returns. The
position is perilous, but there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Repeated return. Danger. No blame.

Blofeld: Frequent returns -- trouble, but no error!

Liu: Frequent returns. Danger. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Imminent Returning. Adversity. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Sequenced return; danger; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Repeated return; danger, no fault.

Cleary (2): Repeated return is diligence. There is no fault.

Wu: He who regains Return after repeatedly losing it will be in a perilous
position, but blameless. [The person seems to be unable to stay on course, but
manages to correct his error every time as soon as he knows it. A combination
of vacillation and endeavor to be right earns him a passing grade.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Notwithstanding her many returns there will be no error
because she aims after righteousness. Wilhelm/Baynes: The danger of
repeated return is, in its essential meaning, deliverance from blame. Blofeld:
This means that we are in no way to blame for the trouble. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Righteous, without fault indeed. Cleary (2): The diligence of repeated return is
faultless if right. Wu: The peril of repeatedly losing Return is in principle
blameless.
24 -- Return -- 24

Legge: Line three is magnetic in the dynamic place at the top of the trigram of
Movement. Any evil issue may be prevented by caution and awareness of danger.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is changeable, departing time after time from the right course
because of his uncontrolled desire for apparent advantages and returning to it for
seemingly better solutions. No great blame will be attached to him, but there is
still some danger.

Wing: This position indicates the type of person who is constantly vacillating
because of the imagined advantages of other paths. This kind of experimentation
could be dangerous, but is mostly an annoyance to all concerned. It is indicated
that the situation will improve nevertheless.

Editor: Implicit here is the idea that there are many lessons to be learned and
reinforced when one undertakes the Work, and uncertainty and vacillation are to
be expected. Often we expect more of ourselves than we are capable of
performing. One doesn't learn how to be a mountain climber by immediately
attempting to scale Mt. Everest. The Work is a task of many lifetimes, involving
the step by step integration of countless disparate complexes within the psyche.
Occasionally we may get off the path, but as long as we remain committed to the
Work we must always return -- hopefully having learned something from our
temporary detour. This is not a justification for a failure of willpower, but it is a
recognition that such failures exist here in the World of the Senses. Blofeld's
interpretation of the Confucian commentary can be misleading -- the "no blame"
or "no error" proviso in the original line derives from our recognition that we
have gotten off the path and are determined to return to it, not usually that we
are entirely free of culpability. On the other hand, the line can sometimes
represent a recurring issue in which personal blame is not an obvious factor: one
just has to deal with it until it’s resolved. (For example, a problem which others
have not integrated, that they keep pushing on you.) In its most negative
interpretation, the line images a chronic condition.

Those relationships which arouse, beckon to us or repel us embody the
archetypal "grand themes" which have been brought into actualization
more or less adequately in our childhood by our parental encounters;
now they confront us ever and again, making us renew old encounters
or making us complete or compensate for that which is still incomplete.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. An unresolved situation presents itself again.

B. The image suggests a vacillation of willpower.

C. You'll have to do it over again until you get it right.
24 -- Return -- 24

D. A repeated offender -- you haven't yet gotten a grip on an old issue.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject moving right in the center
among those represented by the other divided lines, and yet returning alone to
her proper path.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Walking in the midst of others, one returns alone.

Blofeld: Setting forth in company, but returning alone. [This suggests
that our companions will try (or are trying) to lead us astray and that we must
let them go forward alone.]

Liu: One walks among others but returns by oneself. [Now is the time to better
yourself.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Centering movement, solitary Returning.

Shaughnessy: In the ranks there is solitary return.

Cleary (1): Traveling in the center, returning alone.

Wu: Being in the middle, he alone finds Return.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her object is to pursue the proper path. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One returns alone, and so follows the right way. Blofeld: This solitary
return is necessary if the path of righteousness is to be followed. Ritsema/
Karcher: Using adhering-to tao indeed. Cleary (2): (This) is done by following
the path. Wu: Because he follows the principle.

Legge: Line four differs from all the other magnetic lines in that she is the only
one to have a proper correlate in line one. Hence her course is different
accordingly.

Wilhelm: ... [Line four] is in the midst of weak lines, and is itself compliant and
in a weak place. One might infer a lack of initiative. But the line is in the
relationship of correspondence to the strong nine at the beginning, hence solitary
return.
24 -- Return -- 24
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is superficially connected with inferior people but more deeply
attached to a noble friend.

Wing: Your current milieu is inferior. You have become aware of the possibility
of a change for the better and wish to move in that direction. Be aware that your
friends may not follow you. Your path could be a solitary one.

Editor: In an inner sense, this can refer to conflicting emotions and the correct
way to deal with them. The Confucian commentary suggests the paraphrase: "Do
what is right or proper in the situation under question." This is indicated by the
line’s proper alliance with its powerful first line correlate. Wilhelm’s commentary
on the hexagram links to the symbolism of line four: “Thus the [line] counsels
turning away from the confusion of external things, turning back to one’s inner
light. There, in the depths of the soul, one sees the Divine, the One. It is indeed
only germinal, no more than a beginning, a potentiality, but as such clearly to be
distinguished from all objects. To know this One means to know oneself in
relation to the cosmic forces.”

What is it, in the end, that induces a man to go his own way and to rise
out of unconscious identity with the mass as out of a swathing mist? ... It
is what is commonly called vocation: an irrational factor that destines a
man to emancipate himself from the herd and from its well-worn paths.
True personality is always a vocation and puts its trust in it as in God,
despite its being, as the ordinary man would say, only a personal feeling.
But vocation acts like a law of God from which there is no escape. The
fact that many a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing
to one who has vocation. He must obey his own law, as if it were a
daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths. Anyone with a
vocation hears the voice of the inner man: he is called.
Jung -- The Development of Personality

A. Disregard the influence of contrary forces and get back on course. (Stop
comparing yourself with others.)

B. Follow your inner gnosis, not conventional opinion.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the noble return of its subject. There will
be no ground for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Noble hearted return. No remorse.

Blofeld: Returning for some high purpose -- no regret!
24 -- Return -- 24

Liu: Benevolent return. No remorse.

Ritsema/Karcher: Magnanimous Returning. Without repenting.

Shaughnessy: Thick return; there is no regret.

Cleary (1): Attentive return; no regret.

Wu: He attains Return with assiduities. There will be no regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to her striving to perfect herself in accordance
with her central position. Wilhelm/Baynes: Central, therefore he is able to
test himself. Blofeld: This middle line (of the upper trigram) implies critical
self-examination. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering originating-from the
predecessor indeed. Cleary (2): Attentive return without regret is balanced
reflection on oneself. Wu: From a central position he examines himself.

Legge: Line five is in the central place of honor, and the middle of the trigram of
Docility; hence its auspice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man makes a noble hearted recovery by squarely facing his own
shortcomings rather than leaning on trivial excuses.

Wing: You are aware of the need for a new beginning and have the courage to
make the change. By observing your faults with objectivity and resolution at this
time you will gain the strength of character necessary to overcome them.

Editor: Wilhelm's commentary describes a test situation: "(The line) is central;
therefore it is possible for it to test itself and thus to find a way of turning back
from all mistakes. The relationship with the (first line) is not suggested by any
external ties, hence it represents noble hearted free decision." Blofeld's: "critical
self- examination" in the Confucian commentary repeats this idea, as does
Cleary’s “Balanced reflection on oneself.”

The recovery of the original unity cannot come about without the aid of
man, for which purpose he was created and sent down into the place of
the shells which is our world. The restoration of the original unity is a
collective venture each individual must set out to accomplish for himself,
for the restoration of his exiled soul is his own responsibility.
C. Ponce -- Kabbalah

A. One tests one's will by returning to the Work.
24 -- Return -- 24

B. Self-examination reveals your deficiencies. Once they are recognized,
re-center your perception.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject all astray on the subject of
returning. There will be evil. There will be calamity and errors. If with her views
she puts the hosts in motion, the end will be a great defeat, whose issues will
extend to the ruler of the state. Even in ten years she will not be able to repair the
disaster.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Missing the return. Misfortune. Misfortune from within
and without. If armies are set marching in this way, one will in the end suffer a
great defeat, disastrous for the ruler of the country. For ten years it will not be
possible to attack again.

Blofeld: A confused return -- misfortune! Disasters and injury threaten. Armies
set marching, but ultimately a great defeat takes place. Disaster is about to
overtake the ruler and for at least ten years there can be no hope of putting things
to right.

Liu: Confusing return. Misfortune, disaster. If there is a battle, there will be a
great defeat. The ruler of the nation will meet disaster, and it (Sic) will be unable
to attack for ten years. [At this time quietness ensures good fortune, but action
leads to misfortune.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Deluding Returning. Pitfall. Possessing Calamity [and]
Blunder. Availing-of moving legions: completing possesses great destroying.
Using one's city chief: pitfall. Culminating tending-towards ten years- revolved
not controlling chastisement.

Shaughnessy: Lost return; inauspicious. There being this inspection, herewith
move troops; in the end there will be a great defeat, together with its state lord;
inauspicious; until the tenth year you cannot make it upright.

Cleary (1): Straying from return is bad; there is trouble. A military expedition
will end in a great defeat, which is disastrous even for the ruler of the nation;
even in ten years there is no victory.

Wu: Losing Return in bewilderment will be foreboding. There will be calamities.
If he leads his army in battles, he will be thoroughly defeated in the end. The
disaster will inflict his ruler as well. Even in ten years he will not win.
24 -- Return -- 24
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Evil consequences result because the course pursued is
contrary to the proper course for a ruler. Wilhelm/Baynes: The misfortune in
missing the return lies in opposing the way of the superior man. Blofeld: The
misfortune described here is the result of deviation from the path of the Superior
Man. [The omen presages very serious trouble affecting many people besides
ourselves as a result of deviation from the path of virtue.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Reversing the chief: tao indeed. Cleary (2): Turning back on the path of a
leader. Wu: The proper conduct of a sovereign has been violated.

Legge: Line six is magnetic at the top of the hexagram. The time for returning is
over with, and any action she takes will lead to the evils mentioned. "Ten years"
seems to be a round number signifying a long time.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attempts to gain his objectives by force. His blind obstinacy leads
to calamity. The use of armies under these conditions will result in a great defeat
and a long-lasting disaster for the state.

Wing: You've missed the time to make a change for the better at the beginning of
this recent cycle. This is unfortunate because you were quite capable of
recognizing the need for reform. Instead, you have stubbornly locked yourself
into a non-constructive attitude. You must now wait out the entire cycle before
you have another chance to change.

Editor: Line six is an unambiguous image of vacillation about the proper path,
and a warning about the consequences of inferior choices. Note that Legge,
Wilhelm, Liu and Wu all use the conditional ‘if’ to represent the option of
military action: in other words there is still room to avoid defeat by returning to
base rather than attacking. Hence the portent of this line is not necessarily a
foregone conclusion.

Now if a man is engrossed in appetites and ambitions and spends all his
pains on these, all his thoughts must needs be mortal and, so far as that
is possible, he cannot fall short of becoming mortal altogether, since he
has encouraged the growth of his mortality.

25 -- Innocence -- 25
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-FIVE --
INNOCENCE

Other titles: The Unexpected, The Unintentional, The Symbol of Freedom from
Error, Integrity, Without Embroiling, Pestilence, Fidelity, No Error, Freedom
from Vainness, Instinctive Goodness, The Simple, Correctness, Subconscious,
"Whatever happens, keep calm and do what is right." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Innocence indicates progress and success through firm correctness. If
the action of its subject is incorrect, he will fall into error. In such a case it will
not be advantageous to move in any direction.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Innocence. Supreme success. Perseverance furthers. If
someone is not as he should be, he has misfortune, and it does not further him to
undertake anything.

Blofeld: Integrity. (The Unexpected). [this hexagram has two widely
different meanings, both of which occur in what follows.] Sublime success!
Righteous persistence brings reward. Those opposed to righteousness meet with
injury. It is not favorable to have in view any goal (or destination). [Usually this
sentence may be taken to have a wide application; but, in this case, (the
Confucian commentary) suggests that it applies only to the enemies of
righteousness, though it does have a general application for those who receive a
moving line for the sixth place.]

Liu: The Unexpected: sublime success. Benefit. Perseverance. Someone acts
incorrectly: misfortune. No benefit for undertakings.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without embroiling. Spring Growing Harvesting Trial.
One in-no-way correcting: possessing blunder. Not Harvesting: possessing
directed going. [This hexagram describes your situation as being without
confusion or fault. It emphasizes that acting while remaining free from
entangling, vanity or recklessness is the adequate way to handle it. To be in
accord with the time, you are told: act without becoming embroiled!]

Shaughnessy: Pestilence: Prime receipt; beneficial to determine. If it is not
upright there will be an inspection; not beneficial to have somewhere to go.

Cleary (1): Fidelity is creative and developmental. It is beneficial to be correct;
if it is not correct, there will be disaster, and it will not be beneficial to go
anywhere.
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Cleary (2): Freedom from error is very successful, beneficial for the upright.
Denial of what is correct is mistaken, etc.

Wu: Freedom from Vainness is primordial, pervasive, prosperous and
persevering. If it does not stay in the correct course, there will be calamities and
there will be no advantage to have any undertaking.

The Image

Legge: Thunder rolls under heaven, and everything manifests its original nature,
free from all insincerity. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, made their
regulations in complete accordance with the seasons, thereby nourishing all
things.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Under heaven thunder rolls: all things attain the natural
state of innocence. Thus the kings of old, rich in virtue, and in harmony with the
time, fostered and nourished all beings.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder rolling across the whole earth; from
it, all things receive their integrity. [The lower trigram is pictured as thunder,
but it acts through its power to quicken growth.] The ancient rulers gave
abundant and timely nourishment to all.

Liu: Thunder rolls under heaven; everything is innocent. The ancient kings
cultivated virtue and used the appropriate time to nourish all beings.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below heaven thunder moving. Beings associating
Without embroiling. The Earlier Kings used luxuriance suiting the season to
nurture the myriad beings.

Cleary (2): Thunder travels under the sky; things accompany with no error.
Ancient kings promoted flourishing appropriate to the time and nurtured myriad
beings.

Wu: Thunder moves under heaven. All things participate in the spirit of
Freedom from Vainness. The ancient kings acted in time to cause all people
and things to flourish.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Innocence shows the dynamic first line descending from
the upper trigram to become the lord of the hexagram in the lower trigram. We
see the attributes of Motive Power and Strength. The dynamic fifth line is central
and responded to by the magnetic second line. It is the will of heaven that true
progress can only proceed from correctness. If the action of the subject is
incorrect he will fall into error, and it will be unfortunate for him to move in any
25 -- Innocence -- 25

direction. Where can one with the illusion of innocence proceed? Can anything
be accomplished by someone without the assistance of heaven's will?

Legge: Of the two Chinese characters which symbolize Innocence, one is the
symbol of being reckless, and often of being insincere; these two characters in
combination describe a state of entire freedom from such a condition. The subject
of the hexagram therefore, is one who is simple and sincere. This quality is
characteristic of heaven, and of the highest style of humanity. The figure is an
essay on this noble attribute. But an absolute rectitude is essential to it. The
nearer one comes to the ideal of the quality, the more powerful will be his
influence and the greater his success. But let him see to it that he never swerve
from being correct.

Anthony: Innocence means to let go of the present, thereby letting the future
become what it will and being at peace with it... When we have learned to do a
thing for its own sake, we know the meaning of innocence... In keeping our minds
open and free, we are able to meet unexpected events with the help of the
Creative, which always points out the correct and most appropriate response.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Success is possible only if you are impeccably correct. If such is not
the case, take no action at all. ("Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.")

The Superior Man acts in harmony with the times.

The ancient kings in the Image are mentioned by name in seven
hexagrams. (See the commentary on hexagram number 20, Contemplation, for
a fuller discussion of their symbolism.) Here, the Image shows them
synchronizing their laws with the "laws of nature" -- an archetypal concept which
is found in many mystical traditions. Here is the alchemical version:

The individual terrestrial life should correspond to the laws governing
the universe; man's spiritual aspirations should be directed to harmonize
with the wisdom of God. If we accomplish this, the inner consciousness
will awaken to an understanding of the influences of the stars, and the
mysteries of Nature will be revealed to his spiritual perception.
Paracelsus

In terms of the hexagram of Innocence, the idea is that if you are truly
synchronized with your inner cosmos, if you are truly "innocent" (i.e., perfect),
you may succeed under the prevailing conditions, but if you are not in complete
inner accord you would be well advised to sit tight and take no action. To
paraphrase the last sentence of the Confucian commentary: "Can the ego do
anything advantageously without the concurrence of the Self?"
25 -- Innocence -- 25

“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is
perfect.”
Matthew 5: 48

To use the Christian injunction in illustration: the upper trigram of
Heaven is perfect, and the lower trigram of Movement is asked to reflect on how
far he conforms to this ideal. In psychological terms, how do the goals of the ego
compare with those of the Self, the entity to whom the Work is dedicated?

Wilhelm has some interesting commentary on this hexagram, stating that
it can indicate unexpected misfortune. In his book, Lectures on the I Ching,
he comments:

Wu Wang is very peculiar, and its name is not easy to translate. I have
used "Innocence," or the “Unintentional." Having meanwhile thought
about the matter more, I would today render Wu Wang with the term
“Subconscious," even though this expression seems somewhat too
modern ... That which as [Divorcement] severs life enters here into
unconscious realms ... Because the shock is within and is unconscious, it
cannot take its course, and therefore causes the unexpected to happen.
An unexpected disaster is afoot; something may be robbed or stolen.

See line three and its commentaries for further insights into Wilhelm's
ideas here.

To receive this hexagram without changing lines is tantamount to being
asked if you are perfect enough to take action without harm. Sometimes,
depending on circumstances, it can also suggest that your position is correct and
blameless. As always, the context of your query will leave no doubt when this
latter interpretation is intended. If there is doubt, rephrase the question and ask
until you understand. The oracle uses ambiguity to develop your intuition --
especially so on those occasions when all you want is a quick answer.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare what is said here about the Ancient Kings with what is said about
them in hexagrams 8, 16, 20, 21, 24, and 59. What common theme unites them,
and how does it relate to the concept of the Work?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject free from all insincerity. His
advance will be accompanied with good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Innocent behavior brings good fortune.
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Blofeld: Moving onward with integrity brings good fortune.

Liu: Innocent actions bring good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without Embroiling. Going significant.

Shaughnessy: The pestilence goes; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Fidelity, without error; it is auspicious to go.

Cleary (2): Going without error leads to good results.

Wu: Without vainness, he will proceed with auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: When he who is free from insincerity makes any movement,
he will get what he desires. Wilhelm/Baynes: Innocent behavior attains its
will. Blofeld: What is willed comes to pass. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring
purpose indeed. Cleary (2): One attains one’s aspiration. Wu: He will have his
aspirations fulfilled.

Legge: The first line is dynamic at the bottom of the trigram of Movement. His
action will characterize all the action set forth, and will itself be fortunate. This is
another way of saying that true goodness may expect good fortune, "by the
appointment of Heaven."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man follows the original pure impulses of his heart. His
aims will be achieved.

Wing: Acting with integrity and spontaneity will bring you success. You may
trust your instincts, because there is goodness in your heart. Good fortune is
willed.

Editor: This is a very favorable line, showing one who is worthy and able to
advance under the conditions described in the Judgment.

Innocence has nothing to dread.
Racine

A. Maintain an open mind and follow the intuition of the heart.
25 -- Innocence -- 25
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one who reaps without having
ploughed, and gathers the produce of her third year's fields without having
cultivated them for that end. To such a one there will be advantage in whatever
direction she may move.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one does not count on the harvest while plowing, nor on
the use of the ground while clearing it, it furthers one to undertake something.

Blofeld: Do not calculate the size of the harvest while the ploughing is still in
progress, nor gloat over the third year's crop while still planting the virgin
ground. It is favorable to seek some object (or destination).

Liu: Do not count the harvest while planting, nor plow the field that lies in
fallow. There is advantage in undertaking something.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not tilling the crop. Not clearing the plow-land. By-
consequence, Harvesting: possessing directed going.

Shaughnessy: Not sowing or reaping, not breaking new fields nor working old
fields; beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): Not plowing or harvesting, not making new fields, then it is
beneficial to go somewhere.

Cleary (2): Not plowing for the harvest, it is beneficial to go somewhere.

Wu: If he does not expect to reap as he plows the field, or if he does not expect to
harvest in a “ripe” field when he cultivates a raw land, he will have the advantage
of moving ahead.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She reaps without having ploughed -- the thought of riches
to be gotten had not risen in her mind. Wilhelm/Baynes: One does not seek
wealth. Blofeld: It is not meet to calculate profits as such an early stage, nor can
we expect to become rich soon. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet affluence indeed.
Cleary (2): One is not enriched. [This means aspiring only to attain
enlightenment, not thinking of riches or rank. Then it is beneficial to go
somewhere.] Wu: For he is not after material rewards.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, central, and in her correct place. She is entirely
free from selfish or mercenary motives. She is good for the sake of goodness, and
things are such that her action will be successful. She does what she does because
it is right, not because of any gain it might bring to her.
25 -- Innocence -- 25
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man succeeds in everything he undertakes. He does not proceed with
mercenary or selfish interests in mind but does good things for their own sake.
Unsought wealth will come his way.

Wing: Do not dream about the results of your work or the attainment of your
goal. Instead, take action for its own sake and devote your full attention to what
you are now doing. Only in this way can you achieve your aim.

Anthony: Innocence means to answer the duty required by the moment,
regardless of consequences, looking neither forward nor backward. If we have
hopes and expectations, we are disappointed when things do not work out on our
imagined schedule.

Editor: The idea here is that the times are favorable to undertake something
only if you are free of ulterior motives. Because Wilhelm's translation of this line
is conditional, there is a suggestion that there may be some temptation toward
selfishness within the situation. Keep an open mind and remain receptive to your
experience.

Think of the flowers; they never have to spin or weave; yet, I assure you,
not even Solomon in all his regalia was robed like one of these... You must
not set your hearts on things to eat and things to drink; nor must you
worry... Your Father well knows you need them. No; set your hearts on
his kingdom, and these other things will be given to you as well.
Luke 12: 27-32

A. You aren't out to make a point, but to do something for its own sake.

B. "Don't count your chickens before they're hatched."
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows calamity happening to one who is free
from insincerity -- as in the case of an ox that has been tied up. A passer-by finds
it and carries it off, while the people in the neighborhood have the calamity of
being accused and apprehended.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Undeserved misfortune. The cow that was tethered by
someone is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.

Blofeld: Unexpected calamity. Someone ropes an ox and leads it off -- a gain to
the passer-by but a loss to the farmer who owns it!
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Liu: An unexpected misfortune: the cow is tied up, and a passerby takes it. The
passerby gains, the villagers are in trouble.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without Embroiling's calamity. Maybe attaching's cattle.
Moving people's acquiring: Capital people's calamity.

Shaughnessy: The pestilence's disaster: someone ties it to an ox. The traveling
man's gain, is this of the city man.

Cleary (1): The misfortune of fidelity; a tethered ox is a gain for a traveler,
misfortune for the townspeople.

Cleary (2): The misfortune of no error, etc.

Wu: There are hazards despite freedom from vainness. For instance, a villager
ties an ox here, but a passerby leads it away. The villager ends up with a loss.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The passer-by gets the ox -- this proves a calamity to the
people of the neighborhood. Wilhelm/Baynes: If the wanderer gets the cow, it
is the citizen's loss. Blofeld: The former gains an ox at the cost of the owner's
suffering. [The calamity may be threatening us. Otherwise, the implication is
that we cannot avoid gaining something at severe cost to others.] Ritsema/
Karcher: Capital people, calamity indeed. Cleary (2): When a traveler finds
the cow, it is a misfortune for the local people. Wu: The passerby gets the ox and
the villager faces a loss.

Legge: Sometimes calamity may befall the best of us, even when there is
freedom from insincerity. Line three, being magnetic in a dynamic place, is
vulnerable to this misfortune. The people of the neighborhood are of course
entirely innocent. On line three it is said: "The superior man seeks simply to be
free from insincerity, and leaves the question of happiness and calamity to
Heaven.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Undeserved calamity comes to the sincere person. Unexpected misfortunes
of this kind, however, do not throw the superior man off stride.

Wing: Undeserved and unexpected misfortune may come your way. It will pass.
An attitude of Innocence does not preclude bad luck, as such shifts of fortune
are unavoidable. However, an innocent posture should not be abandoned for it
can reveal new ways of dealing with problems.

Anthony: Situations occur which are negative, and it is not our fault.
Nevertheless, we must adjust to them with acceptance. To fail to do so will only
25 -- Innocence -- 25

bring on further misfortune. We should not let negative events destroy our
innocence of mind.

Editor: The symbolism usually implies that you have just been wronged through
no fault of your own. Cleary’s Buddhist commentary introduces a different
interpretation: “This represents the unbalanced and aberrant who cling to a
principle that is without error and make it into a misfortune. When a traveler
finds the cow, why then cling to principle and seek a reward from the local
people? Is this not misfortune extending to the innocent?” Note that the
references to the innocent villagers’ culpability in Legge, Liu and Cleary-2 suggest
there may be hidden nuances to this line.

Yes, injustice committed by another is an injustice for the one who has
committed it and he is not released from his responsibility. But,
considered within the universal order, it is not an injustice in the cosmos,
not even for the one who has suffered it. It is a necessary occurrence. If
the one who undergoes it is a good man, it will have for him a happy
issue. One must not believe this cosmic order to be "not of the gods" or
unjust. It distributes exactly to each what is fitting to each. But we are
ignorant of the causes and that accords our ignorance the occasion for
blaming it.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. "Into each life some rain must fall."

B. It’s probably just karma at work: don’t make it worse.

Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows a case in which, if its subject can remain
firm and correct, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He who can be persevering remains without blame.

Blofeld: Something can be accomplished by righteous persistence and no error
is involved.

Liu: If one carries on, no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Permitting Trial. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Able to be determined; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): One should be correct; then there is no error.

Wu: If he can remain firm and correct, he will be blameless.
25 -- Innocence -- 25
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He firmly holds fast his correctness. Wilhelm/Baynes:
For he possesses firmly. Blofeld: That is to say firmness will enable us to fulfill
our aim. Ritsema/Karcher: Firmly possessing it indeed. Cleary (1): This is
inherent. Wu: Because he holds fast to what he has gotten.

Legge: Line four is the lowest in the trigram of strength, and line one is not a
proper correlate. Also, the fourth line is dynamic in a magnetic place, so caution
is necessary.

Anthony: Dread of losing is as faulty as anticipation of winning.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: What really belongs to the man cannot be lost to him. As long as he remains
steadfast to his own nature, he will commit no error.

Wing: Do not be influenced by the designs of those around you. It is very
important, at this time, that you trust your inner vision. Obey your instincts.

Editor: There is a definite qualification in most translations of this line: "IF you
can maintain correctness, you will succeed -- or at least not be incorrect.” The
wording can imply doubt, and hints at a possible test of your discrimination. The
wisest reading is that if you aren't impeccable, the injunction from the Judgment
is appropriate here: "If someone is not as he should be, he has misfortune, and it
does not further him to undertake anything.”

If you live right, the coincidences will build up for you in unexpected and
surprising and beneficial ways. If you do not live right, the anti-
coincidences will build up in unexpected and direful, sometimes
disastrous ways. The criterion of whether or not you are living right is
empirical observation of the coincidences. If the coincidences build up,
you are living right. If they do not build up, you are not living right and
had best examine your way of life.
John Lilly -- Simulations of God

A. If you have the courage to maintain your will and do what is correct,
success will follow.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows one who is free from insincerity, and yet
has fallen ill. Let him not use medicine, and he will have occasion for joy in his
recovery.
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Wilhelm/Baynes: Use no medicine in an illness incurred through no fault of
your own. It will pass of itself.

Blofeld: Unexpected illness, but it will be best not to treat it.

Liu: For an unexpected illness, use no medicine. Good fortune will follow.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without Embroiling's affliction. No medicinal herbs,
possessing rejoicing.

Shaughnessy: The pestilence's illness: there is no medicine but there is
happiness.

Cleary (1): For sickness without error don’t use medicine; there will be joy.

Wu: He feels sick being free from vainness. He will be happy for having taken no
medicine.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Medicine in the case of one who is free from insincerity
should not be tried at all. Wilhelm/Baynes: One should not try an unknown
medicine. Blofeld: What this really means is that we should avoid applying
untried remedies. Ritsema/Karcher: Not permitting testing indeed. Cleary
(2): Medicine should not be tried when nothing is wrong. Wu: No medicine
should be taken for being free from vainness.

Legge: Line five is dynamic in the central place of honor, and has a proper
correlate in line two. Hence he must possess the qualities of the hexagram in
perfection. Nevertheless, he is sick or in distress. He need not be anxious --
without his efforts a way of escape will be opened for him. The idea is that
sickness shouldn't happen to one who is perfectly sincere, and if it does happen it
must refer to some inexplicable will of Heaven. If such is the cause, then so shall
it cure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Unexpected evil comes to the man through no fault of his own. He should
not anxiously resort to hasty remedies. Nature will overcome the evil in her own
way and at her own pace.

Wing: What may appear as an unfortunate turn of events has internal causes.
External remedies will not solve the problem. What is occurring is an inner
process. Let nature take its course. The solution will come of itself.
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Editor: Wilhelm observes: "That he appears ill comes from his way of taking
the illnesses of others upon himself.” This can refer to both other people in the
outer world, or to "others" in the inner world of the psyche -- our autonomous
drives, appetites, emotions, etc. The psychological concept of "co- dependence”
often applies to this line.

I have reflected a great deal upon the magical powers of the soul of man,
and I have discovered a great many secrets in Nature, and I will tell you
that he only can be a true physician who has acquired this power. If our
physicians did possess it, their books might be burnt and their medicines
be thrown into the ocean, and the world would be all the more benefited
by it.
Paracelsus

A. Do nothing and things will improve by themselves.

B. You bear the illusions of others as if they were your own. Co-
dependence helps nobody.

C. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject free from insincerity, yet sure
to fall into error if he takes action. His action will not be advantageous in any
way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Innocent action brings misfortune. Nothing furthers.

Blofeld: If it is unexpected, a journey now would be injurious. This is a time
favorable for those with no destination in view.

Liu: Innocent action brings disaster. No advantage.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without Embroiling. Moving possessing blunder. Without
direction: Harvesting. [Without direction: Harvesting, WU YU Li: no plan
or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not
impose a direction on events.]

Shaughnessy: The pestilence's motion; there is an inspection; there is no place
to benefit.

Cleary (1): If fidelity in action has faults, there is no benefit. [This is fidelity not
knowing when enough is enough.]
25 -- Innocence -- 25

Cleary (2): Even if there is no error, action involves misfortune, so no benefit is
gained. [This refers to clinging to a constant and not knowing how to change
adaptively.]

Wu: Even without vainness, he will face calamities if he chooses to act. There is
nothing to gain. [The sixth is not a position for doing anything aggressively.
There is nothing sensible for the sixth to undertake. Doing what is not supposed
to be done is an overextension.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Action is inappropriate now because the time for it has
passed. Wilhelm/Baynes: Action without reflection brings about the evil of
bewilderment. Blofeld: An unexpected journey now would plunge us into a
state of dangerous exhaustion. Ritsema/Karcher: Exhaustion's calamity
indeed. Cleary (2): Action without error involves misfortune when it comes to
an impasse. Wu: the action taken without vainness will result in calamities from
overextension.

Legge: Line six is at the top of the hexagram, and comes into the field when the
action has run its course. He should be still, and not initiate any fresh movement.
When a thing is over and done, submission and acquiescence are what are
required -- not renewed attempts at action.

Anthony: When innocent action begins to meet with resistance, it is best to
disconnect and fall back on acceptance. We should work with a situation only
when it works with us, going only so far as openness in the other person allows.
Waiting quietly without ulterior designs means to truly disconnect, inwardly, and
go on our way.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The time is not ripe for further progress. The man keeps still. Activities in
opposition to fate will not help him in any way.

Wing: Progress is impossible. Even innocent actions will create chaos. Do not
attempt anything new, nor try to improve upon your surroundings. Do not do
anything at all.

Editor: Wilhelm compares the import of this line to line six of The Dynamic:
"Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.” Ritsema/Karcher’s “In order to
take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events” puts a
slightly different spin on the meaning, suggesting that circumstances will
improve if you can keep from meddling.

Today's achievement is only tomorrow's confusion. -- W. D. Howells

25 -- Innocence -- 25

A. Ignorant choices create confused consequences.

B. Sit tight -- allow the situation to unfold without taking action.

26 -- Controlled Power -- 26
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-SIX –
CONTROLLED POWER

Other titles: The Taming Power of the Great, The Great Nourisher, Taming the
Great Powers, Great Accumulating, Great Accumulation, Great Storage,
Nurturance of the Great, Great Buildup, Restraint of the Great, Restraint by the
Strong, Potential Energy, The Great Taming Force, Energy Under Control, Power
Restrained, Sublimation, Latent Power

Judgment

Legge: Controlled Power means being firm and correct. If its subject doesn't
enjoy his family revenues at the expense of public service, there will be good
fortune. It will be advantageous to cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Taming Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers.
Not eating at home brings good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water.

Blofeld: The Great Nourisher favors righteous persistence. Good fortune
results from not eating at home. It is a favorable time for crossing the great river
(sea). [I.e. going on a long journey, perhaps abroad.]

Liu: Taming the Great Powers. Persistence benefits. Not to eat at home is
good fortune. It is of benefit to cross the great water.

Ritsema/Karcher: Great Accumulating. Harvesting Trial. Not dwelling,
taking-in. Significant. Harvesting: wading the Great River. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of an overriding concern that defines what is
valuable. It emphasizes that bringing the variety of things under the control of
this central idea is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Great Storage: Beneficial to determine; not eating at home is
auspicious; beneficial to ford the great river.

Cleary (1): In Nurturance of the Great it is beneficial to be chaste. It is good
not to eat at home; it is beneficial to cross great rivers. [This hexagram
represents incubation nurturing the spiritual embryo. On this path, it is
beneficial to still strength, not to use strength. Therefore it says: “it is beneficial
to be chaste.” Chastity here means quietude. Stilling strength is nurturing
strength. It is good to be still, not active – if one is still, this preserves strength;
if one is active, this damages strength. This is the work referred to as “nine
years facing a wall.”]
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

Cleary (2): Great Buildup is beneficial if correct, etc.

Wu: Restraint of the Great indicates prosperity and perseverance. It will be
auspicious not to have meals at home. It will be advantageous to cross the big
river. [The character chu in the present context has two meanings: one is to
accumulate and the other to restrain.]

The Image

Legge: Heaven in the midst of the mountain -- the image of Controlled
Power. Thus, the superior man studies the words and deeds of ancient men in
order to build his virtue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Heaven within the mountain: the image of the Taming
Power of the Great. Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many
sayings of antiquity and many deeds of the past, in order to strengthen his
character thereby.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes the sky visible amidst the mountain peaks.
The Superior Man, acting from his profound knowledge of the words and conduct
of the wise men of old, nourishes his virtue. [The arrangement of the component
trigrams suggests glimpses of the sky among the peaks of the mountains. This
points to something very far off and thereby indicates the advisability of setting
out for some distant place. This is a time for going from home and giving
concrete expression to our appreciation of what others have done for us or for
the public good.]

Liu: Heaven within the mountain symbolizes Taming the Great Powers. The
wise man studies ancient knowledge to improve his character.

Ritsema/Karcher: Heaven located-in mountain center. Great
Accumulating. A chun tzu uses the numerous recorded preceding words going
to move. [A chun tzu] uses accumulating one's actualizing-tao. [Actualize-tao:
...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos...
Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Heaven is in the mountains, great accumulation. Thus do
superior people become acquainted with many precedents of speech and action,
in order to accumulate virtue.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders build up their virtues by abundant knowledge of past
words and deeds.

Wu: Heaven is within the mountain; this is Restraint of the Great. Thus the
jun zi accumulates his virtue by remembering past words and deeds.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The trigrams that compose Controlled Power show the
intelligence of Strength and Mass renewing their virtue every day. A dynamic
line is in the highest place, displaying the worth of talent and virtue -- his is the
power that keeps Strength in restraint and displays the will necessary to the
hexagram. Talents and virtue are nourished because he refuses to confine his
power within his immediate family. Heaven in the second line responds to the
ruler in the fifth, thus it is favorable to cross the great stream.

Legge: Controlled Power symbolizes both restraint and the accumulation of
virtue. What is restrained accumulates its strength and increases its volume to
become a great reservoir of force. The Judgment teaches that if one is firm and
correct in this endeavor he may then engage in public service and enjoy the king's
grace.

The dynamic line in the highest place is line six who is above the ruler and
has all of heaven in which to move. This, plus the power to suppress the strongest
opposition, shows how he is supported by all that is correct.

Concerning the Image, Chu Hsi says: "Heaven is the greatest of all things,
and its being in the midst of a mountain gives us the idea of a very large
accumulation. This is analogous to the labor of the superior man in learning,
acquiring and remembering, to accumulate his virtue."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Controlled Power is willpower. The ego renounces selfish
indulgences to work for the good of the whole. With such a spirit, great
transformations are possible.

The Superior Man studies the precepts of the Work to increase his
comprehension and fortitude.

The essential image to remember in this hexagram is that of Mount
Everest holding down Heaven itself: raw power is controlled by the sheer mass of
Keeping Still. Thus we see that Controlled Power is Willpower -- arguably the
most potentially creative force in the universe, because used correctly it can
accomplish anything.

The will is, curiously, not recognized as the central and fundamental
function of the ego. It has often been depreciated as being ineffective
against the various drives and the power of the imagination, or it has
been considered with suspicion as leading to self-assertion (will-to-
power). But the latter is only a perverted use of the will, while the
apparent futility of the will is due only to a faulty and unintelligent use.

26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

The will is ineffective only when it attempts to act in opposition to the
imagination and to the other psychological functions, while its skilful and
consequently successful use consists in regulating and directing all other
functions toward a deliberately chosen and affirmed aim.
Roberto Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

An extreme example of this is illustrated by Cleary’s commentary on the
Judgment where he says: “This is the work referred to as “nine years facing a
wall.” The reference is to Bodhidharma (the patriarch who brought Zen
Buddhism to China), who meditated facing a wall for nine continuous years until
he attained enlightenment.

"If its subject doesn't enjoy his family revenues at the expense of public
service, there will be good fortune” is an image of the ego renouncing its illusions
of free choice. Psychologically, inner complexes will drain energy from the
situation unless the ego has the will to control their manifestation. Every line
except the sixth depicts some kind of restraint of power -- only in the top line is
the energy available for use. It is significant that the superior man is advised to
study the ancient wisdom, for it is in the Mysteries, the Perennial Philosophy,
that one discovers the secrets and applications of the will. In other contexts (for
example, a question about business matters), this can refer to making connection
with sound and established practices.

In the larger philosophical sense, we see that the evolving illusions of every
age insure that the masses will remain attached to the wheel of birth and death --
continuously repeating endless variations of the same basic lessons. When each
individual is finally ready to escape from these cycles, it is only within the ancient
and eternal template of the Work that transcendence can be found.

The analogies between religious ideas in Jewish mysticism that are
hundreds of years old and the scientific findings of modern psychology
can be explained only by the archetypal structure of the psyche. Man's
images and ideas concerning the mysteries of being fall into the timeless
patterns arranged by the archetypes of the unconscious; his meditations
are determined by them. Within the setting of his culture and his time, he
creates new forms for the expression of age-old truths.
A. Jaffe -- The Myth of Meaning

Through contact with the Self, negative cycles can be broken and positive
cycles begun, but it always requires a mountain's worth of Controlled Power to
make it happen.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject in a position of peril. It will be
advantageous for him to stop his advance.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

Wilhelm/Baynes: Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist.

Blofeld: Trouble threatens -- it would be wise to bring activities to a halt.

Liu: When one meets danger, it is better to stop.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing adversity. Harvesting: climaxing.

Shaughnessy: There is danger; beneficial to stop.

Cleary (1): There is danger; it is beneficial to stop.

Cleary (2): There is danger; help yourself.

Wu: There is danger ahead. It will be advantageous to stop here.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He should not rashly expose himself to calamity. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Thus one does not expose oneself to danger. Blofeld: That is, no
attempt should be made to avert the trouble. Ritsema/Karcher: Not opposing
calamity indeed. Cleary (2): Help yourself – do not get into trouble. Wu: To
avoid calamities.

Legge: Line one is subject to opposition or repression from line four. This
calamity will be increased if he tries to advance, so it is better for him to halt.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is confronted with dangerous obstacles. He should
not attempt to advance rashly but remain composed.

Wing: Compose yourself. You may feel that you are restrained from advancing.
In fact, there are obstacles on the path ahead. It would be wise to halt.

Editor: The line itself is unambiguous, though the contradictory Confucian
commentaries are subject to interpretation: depending on context, one should
either actively avoid danger, or passively allow it to run its course. It is generally
safest to accept Wilhelm's translation when doubt prevails.

Those that live their life in Tao achieve realization of their nature in
inaction.
Chuangtse, quoting Confucius

A. Stop now -- don't expose yourself to danger.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows a carriage with the strap under it
removed.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The axletrees are taken from the wagon.

Blofeld: A broken axle.

Liu: The axletree separates from the wagon.

Ritsema/Karcher: Carting, stimulating the axle-strap.

Shaughnessy: The cart throws off an axle-strut.

Cleary (1): A cart is divested of its axles.

Cleary (2): A cart has its axles removed.

Wu: The wooden pieces holding the axle firmly underneath a carriage come off.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is like a carriage from which the strap under it has been
removed -- being in the central place, he will incur no blame. Wilhelm/
Baynes: In the middle there is no blame. Blofeld: We are not to blame. [A
relatively serious hindrance threatens, but we are not to blame for it.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Centering without surpassing indeed. Cleary (2): But
there is no resentment in the heart. Wu: The pieces come off, but the center is
faultless.

Legge: Line two is subject to the repression of the fifth line, so he stops his
advance voluntarily -- he has the wisdom to do so because of his central place.
The strap below, when attached to the axle, made the carriage stop; he himself
acts that part.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The opposition is decisively stronger. The man should wait while
storing energy for his next move.

Wing: There is no opportunity for advancement. You are held back by forces that
are beyond your reach. Stay where you are and continue to build the resources of
your potential energy. Be content with the present situation. There should be
no conflict.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

Editor: A modern image might be an automobile up on blocks – a vehicle is
immobilized. In a strange mixture of metaphors, from the ruler's perspective (see
Legge's commentary on line five), this second line correlate is seen as a castrated
boar -- a potentially dangerous force which has been transformed into a safe one.
Usually the line simply means that no action is possible at this time.

Here I am speaking not of a power complex, or of an identification with
the will to power, but rather of the feeling of ability to control oneself and
one's actions, and of the power to choose a goal and to do what is
necessary to achieve it. This is a positive factor leading to self-discipline
and culture, and on its development civilization largely depends.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Stop striving -- nothing can be done now.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject urging his way with good
horses. It will be advantageous for him to realize the difficulty of his course, and
to be firm and correct, exercising himself daily in his charioteering and methods
of defense. Then there will be advantage in whatever direction he may advance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A good horse that follows others. Awareness of danger, with
perseverance, furthers. Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily. It
furthers one to have somewhere to go.

Blofeld: A fine steed galloping. Persistence under difficulties will win
advantage. It is best to be occupied all day long with defensive measures. It is
favorable to have a goal (or destination) in view.

Liu: Good horses compete with each other. It is of benefit to continue working
hard and to keep the chariot safe. It is of benefit to go somewhere.

Ritsema/Karcher: A fine horse, pursuing. Harvesting: drudgery, Trial.
Spoken-thus: an enclosed cart, escorting. Harvesting: possessing directed going.

Shaughnessy: A fine horse follows; beneficial for determination about
difficulty. It is called a barrier-cart [defense]. Beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): A good horse gives chase. It is beneficial to struggle for right. Daily
practicing charioteering and defense, it is beneficial to go somewhere.

Cleary (2): ... To have somewhere to go.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

Wu: Fine horses are chasing one another. It will be advantageous to remain
persevering. Daily practice in charioteering and self-defense will benefit wherever
he wants to go.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The subject of the topmost line is of the same mind with
him. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will of the one above is in agreement. Blofeld:
For this line, which tops the lower hexagram (Sic) presages the fulfillment of our
will. Ritsema/Karcher: Uniting purposes above indeed. Cleary (2): Joining
in the aims of those above. Wu: His wish is in consonance with the one above.

Legge: Line three is the last of the trigram of Creative Power and it responds to
the top line of the upper trigram of Keeping Still. As they are both dynamic the
latter does not exert his repressive force. They advance rapidly together, but the
position of the third line is perilous. By firmness and caution, however, its
subject will escape the peril, and the issue will be good. When the action of the
hexagram has reached line six, its work is done. Line six will no longer exercise
repression, but join with line three, assisting his advance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is joined by strong allies who are going in the same direction. The
obstacles begin to give way. But the dangers are not over. He must remain alert,
well prepared, and farsighted.

Wing: The path will begin to open for you, and your progress will be unhindered.
Others may join forces with you. Nevertheless, you must constantly keep your
personal goals in mind. Remain cautious.

Editor: Think of the lower trigram as a kind of throttle, and the upper trigram as
the brakes and you have an image of driving, or "charioteering." A good driver
uses both throttle and brakes as required to advance the vehicle toward its
destination. To switch metaphors, a master samurai warrior is so in tune with
the Zen of the battle that his advance and retreat (throttle and brakes) attain a
kind of poetic transcendence. "Daily exercise" means that the requirements of
the Work are dynamic and constantly changing -- what was an appropriate
response yesterday may be totally incorrect today, yet essential again tomorrow.
One must constantly stay on top of the changes taking place. Take nothing for
granted. The line tells us explicitly how hard this is to do: "It will be
advantageous for him to realize the difficulty of his course." Ritsema/Karcher
translate "horse" as: "...Symbol of spirited strength in the natural world,
counterpart of dragon..." In the context imaged here, this energy is under the
control of the will and capable of full performance. The Confucian commentary
tells us that Self and ego are in accord on this one. The overall image suggests
forces seeking equilibrium -- with will and intent the outcome can be positive.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

In all forms of strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in
everyday life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance.
Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. Exercise your willpower by staying on top of a constantly changing
situation. The warrior spirit advances the Work.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows the young bull, and yet having pieces of
wood over his horns. There will be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The headboard of a young bull. Great good fortune.

Blofeld: The headboard of a young ox -- sublime good fortune! [The symbol is a
piece of wood, not unlike a cangue, used for the same purpose as a rope and
nose-ring. The suggestion is that one who has not yet attained his full strength
benefits from being restrained.]

Liu: The headboard restrains the young bull. Great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Youthful cattle's stable. Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: The young ox's restraint; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): The horns of a young ox are very auspicious.

Cleary (2): The horn-guard of a young ox is very auspicious.

Wu: It is like putting a wooden crossbar over the horns of a young bull. There
will be great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There will be occasion for joy. Wilhelm/Baynes: It has
joy. Blofeld: Good fortune in the form of happiness. Ritsema/Karcher:
Possessing rejoicing indeed. Cleary (2): There is joy. Wu: It is a sign of joy.

Legge: The young bull doesn't have horns yet. Attaching a piece of wood to
shape their growth and prevent goring is an instance of extraordinary precaution,
and precaution is always good.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man retrains the wild force by timely preventive acts and
extraordinary precautions, like fastening a headboard on the growing horns
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

of a young bull.

Wing: That which has held you back has, in fact, aided in your growth. Instead
of squandering your resources on premature advancements, you have built up a
strong reserve of potential energy. Good fortune.

Editor: Blofeld, Shaughnessy and Cleary render "ox" instead of "bull" -- an
unfortunate word choice. (Since an ox is a castrated bull, the meaning of the line
is muddled.) The image is one of energy which grows -- i.e., matures and
accumulates. To shape this accumulation within the structure of a higher ideal or
intent (the "headboard") is to maintain control over it and prevent its
autonomous release. Psychologically, the metaphor suggests a forming template,
such as the precepts of the Work ("the words and deeds of ancient men” in the
Image), which shapes consciousness in accordance with an archetypal ideal. This
raises the issue of the difference between disciplined sublimation and repression:

In the face of a seemingly insoluble conflict, awareness and discipline are
called for. Repression is something else; it is the act of shutting our eyes
in order to avoid the suffering of discipline.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Channel your power, shape your impulses, structure your will, focus
your intent. Impose restrictions now to prevent later lack of control.

B. "As the twig is bent..."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the teeth of a castrated hog. There will be
good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The tusk of a gelded boar. Good fortune.

Blofeld: A gelded boar's tusk -- good fortune! [This is an emblem of
opportunity.]

Liu: The boar has a tusk but is gelded. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: A gelded pig's tusks. Significant.

Shaughnessy: The crying pig's teeth; auspicious.

Cleary (1): The tusks of a gelded boar are auspicious.

Wu: It is like the teeth of a castrated pig. There will be fortune.
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is occasion for congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes:
It has blessing. Blofeld: Good fortune in the form of blessings. [i.e. good fortune
apparently unconnected with our efforts or deserts.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): There is celebration. Wu: There is
something to celebrate.

Legge: A boar is a powerful and dangerous animal. Let him be castrated, and
though his tusks remain, he cares little to use them. Line five is the ruler of the
hexagram whose duty it is to repress the advance of evil. An encounter with the
strong second line would be dangerous, but the ruler has taken the early
precaution of reducing line two to the condition of a castrated boar. Not only is
there no evil, there is good fortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man dissipates the wild force by controlling its basic source.

Wing: By cutting off the roots of an uncontrolled great force, it can be restrained
and redirected. This indirect approach is much better than direct combat or
confrontation. Good fortune.

Editor: The idea here is one of sublimation. To sublimate is to "make sublime" -

    that is, to transform a lower impulse into a higher one: to refashion that which
    is coarse into that which is fine. The difference between this line and the
    previous one is that line four shows the energy externally modified, whereas here
    it is internally transformed to a higher category. The image can sometimes
    suggest the idea of foresight -- "A stitch in time saves nine."

The animal elements, instincts, and desires existed before the Divine
Spirit illuminated them and made them into man. The animal soul of
man is derived from the cosmic animal elements, and the animal
kingdom is therefore the father of the animal man. If man is like his
animal father, he resembles an animal; if he is like the Divine Spirit that
may illuminate his animal elements, he is like a god. If his reason is
absorbed by his animal instincts, it becomes animal reason; if it rises
above his animal desires, it becomes angelic.
Paracelsus

A. Sublimate your impulses so that they won't overpower you in an
unguarded moment.

B. "Nip it in the bud." A force is altered before it can cause harm.

C. Image of a transformation of energy from crude to sublime.

26 -- Controlled Power -- 26
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject as in command of the
firmament of heaven. There will be progress.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One attains the way of heaven. Success.

Blofeld: Carrying (i.e. according with) heaven's way.

Liu: One follows the way of heaven. Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore heaven's highway? Growing.

Shaughnessy: How wary is heaven; receipt.

Cleary (1): Carrying the crossroads of heaven; development. [At the end of
nurturance of the great, the achievement complete, the practice fulfilled, with a
peal of thunder the real person emerges, startling the ignorant, amazing the
mundane ... When practitioners of the Tao reach liberation and attain reality,
there is a body outside the body, beyond heaven and earth.]

Cleary (2): Carrying the crossroads of heaven is successful.

Wu: It is at the crossroads of heaven. There will be pervasiveness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The way is grandly open for movement. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Truth works in the great. Blofeld: This implies great progress along
the way of virtue. Ritsema/Karcher: Tao: the great moving indeed. Cleary
(2): The way is carried out on a grand scale. Wu: The way of heaven prevails.

Legge: The work of repression is over, and the dynamic subject of line six
now has ample scope to carry out the idea of the hexagram in the accumulation of
virtue.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man eventually removes all obstacles and attains progress and honor.

Wing: All obstacles give way. potential energy can be used to accomplish
great deeds in the world. Align yourself with the tao and you will meet with
unparalleled success.

Editor: This is the only line of the hexagram that does not depict some form of
restraint of power, implying that when the ego has learned to control its inner
26 -- Controlled Power -- 26

forces they are available for transformation by the Self. Cleary’s commentary
describes what this experience may be like: “When practitioners of the Tao reach
liberation and attain reality, there is a body outside the body, beyond heaven
and earth.” If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is number
eleven, Harmony, in which Heaven and Earth unite: ego and Self are as
portrayed in this line.

The great majority of humanity are ruled by their external
circumstances, but the superior man is he who works out his own
direction and then changes his environment, or his reaction to it,
accordingly. He is a master of his destiny.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-SEVEN --
NOURISHMENT

Other titles: The Corners of the Mouth, Providing Nourishment, The Symbol of
the Cheek and of Nourishment, Jaws, Lower Jaw, Nurturing, Swallowing,
Sagacious Counsel, Nourishing, To Feed, "Can mean money, usually as the result
of effort." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Nourishment indicates good fortune through firm correctness. Make
sure you know what you are feeding, and determine your proper diet.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Corners of the Mouth. Perseverance brings good
fortune. Pay heed to the providing of nourishment and to what a man seeks to fill
his own mouth with.

Blofeld: Nourishing. (Nourishment -- literally Jaws) [The form of this
hexagram readily brings to mind the concept of wide open jaws, but the word
nourishment must not be taken only in a literal sense; for we are concerned here
with all those things which men seek both for their own advantage and for
giving succor or assistance to others.] Righteous persistence brings good
fortune. Watch people nourishing others and observe with what manner of things
they seek to nourish themselves. [For this will teach us a lot about their
characters.]

Liu: Nourishment. Continuing leads to good fortune. Observe the providing of
nourishment and the food someone seeks for himself.

Ritsema/Karcher: Jaws, Trial: significant. Viewing Jaws. Originating-from
seeking mouth substance. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
nourishing and being nourished. It emphasizes that opening in order to take
things in as well as providing to others is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Jaws: Determination is auspicious. View the jaw; oneself
seeking the mouth's fullness.

Cleary (1): In nourishment, it is good to be correct. Observe nourishment,
and seek fulfillment for the mouth by yourself.

Cleary (2): Nourishment is good if correct. Observe nourishment, and seek
food by yourself.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Wu: Nurturing indicates that with perseverance there will be auspiciousness.
People should observe the principle of nurturing and find proper foods for
nourishment.

Hua-Ching Ni: In nourishment, one should seek the right nutrition and not be
tempted by what others enjoy.

The Image

Legge: The image of thunder under a mountain forms Nourishment. The
superior man, in accordance with this, controls his speech and regulates his
eating and drinking.

Wilhelm/Baynes: At the foot of the mountain, thunder: the image of The
Corners of the Mouth. Thus the superior man is careful in his words and
temperate in eating and drinking.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder rumbling at the foot of a mountain.
The Superior Man is thoughtful in speech and frugal in his eating and drinking.
[The lower trigram, thunder, also represents the power of quickening growth;
hence its place in a hexagram concerned with nourishment.]

Liu: Thunder rolling around the foot of the mountain is the symbol of
Nourishment. The superior man is cautious in his speech; he restrains and
regulates his eating and drinking.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below mountain possessing thunder. Jaws. A chun tzu
uses considering words to inform. [A chun tzu uses] articulating to drink and
take-in.

Cleary (1): There is thunder beneath the mountain. Superior people are careful
about what they say, and moderate in eating and drinking.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders are prudent in speech, moderate in consumption.

Wu: There is thunder below the mountain; this is Nurturing. Thus the jun zi
speaks with caution and drinks and eats with moderation.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: When the nourishing is correct, there will be good fortune.
We must examine those whom we wish to nourish, and we must also examine our
own nourishing of ourselves. Heaven and earth nourish all things. The sages
nourish men of talent and virtue in order to reach the masses. Great is the work
intended in the time of nourishing.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Legge: The character of Nourishment is the symbol of the upper jaw, but the
image of the hexagram suggests a whole mouth with undivided lines at top and
bottom, and divided lines between them. The bottom line is in the trigram of
Movement, and the top line is in the trigram of Keeping Still -- giving the image
of a mobile lower jaw and a fixed upper jaw. The divided lines represent the
mouth cavity. The hexagram denotes nourishing of body or mind, of one's self or
others, and the proper nourishment in each case must necessarily vary according
to circumstances. Thus, judgment must be exercised to determine which
nourishment is in harmony with correctness and virtue.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Nourishment asks you to examine your motives in the allocation
of your energy. Willpower creates a well- balanced apportionment.

The Superior Man controls his expression and monitors his appetites.

The lines in the lower trigram of Movement are all rendered unfavorably
to one degree or another, while the lines of the upper trigram of Keeping Still are
all generally correct. The implication is that non-action is almost always
preferable to movement. This idea is fundamental to the philosophy of the I
Ching, and in the hexagram of Nourishment the lesson is that non-action
feeds and strengthens the psyche.

All actions are the expression of psychic energy through a physical body to
create an effect in spacetime. Each effect creates consequences which usually
demand further action. It is easy to see that action which is not initiated by the
Self can only result in unexpected consequences, and that action which conforms
to the will of the Self is motivated by and directed toward a transcendent goal.
Although correct non-action generally creates no negative consequences in
spacetime, it does have nourishing consequences in the psyche as autonomous
forces are gathered, digested, assimilated and renewed in ascending
configurations of growth.

As this Path represents the structure of the [ego], the attribution of the
Mouth reminds us that the purpose of incarnation is the seeking of the
food of experience in Form for the benefit of the [Self] and the Spirit.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare the Image of Nourishment in this hexagram with those in
hexagram number five, Waiting; number forty-eight, The Well; and number
fifty, The Sacrificial Vessel.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, seems to be thus addressed: "You leave your
efficacious tortoise, and look at me till your lower jaw hangs down.” There will be
evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: You let your magic tortoise go, and look at me with the
corners of your mouth drooping. Misfortune.

Blofeld: You released your sacred tortoise and stared at me with mouth agape --
misfortune! [The shells of tortoises were used for divination. Here, the
implication seems to be that someone abandons his sacred duty in his greed
(symbolized by ‘mouth agape') to obtain what he wants from the person to
whom “me” refers. It may be that contemporaries of the authors of the I Ching
were familiar with a story to which this sentence pertains.]

Liu: If you leave your divine tortoise and look at me with mouth drooling, there
will be misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stowing-away simply the psyche tortoise. Viewing my
pendant jaws. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Dispensing with your numinous turtle, and viewing our
shortened jaw; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Abandoning your spiritual tortoise, you watch my moving jaw – this
is unfortunate.

Cleary(2): To give up your sacred tortoise and watch me greedily leads to
misfortune.

Wu: “Abandon your spiritual tortoise and watch me with your mouth watering.”
Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He thus shows himself unfit to be thought noble. Wilhelm/
Baynes: This is really not to be respected. Blofeld: Looking at me like that is
hardly to be regarded as admirable behavior. Ritsema/Karcher: Truly not the
stand to value indeed. Cleary(2): To watch me greedily is not worthy of respect.
Wu: He who watches with his mouth watering is also unworthy of respect.

Legge: The first line is dynamic and in his proper place. He might suffice for the
nourishing of himself like a tortoise, which is said to live on air. But he is drawn
out of himself by desire for the magnetic line four, his proper correlate, at whom
he looks till his jaw hangs down, or, as we say, his mouth waters. Hence the
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

auspice is bad. The symbolism takes the form of a reprimand addressed by the
fourth line to the first. As Mencius said, "He who attends his smaller self
becomes an inferior man, and he who attends to his greater self becomes a
superior man."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is envious of the prosperity of others.

Wing: You are so actively aware of the prosperity of others that you lose control
of your own destiny. This is deplorable behavior and will result in misfortune.

Editor: This line is a reprimand for an unworthy attitude. Since in China the
tortoise was associated with divination, it refers to a higher realm of perception.
The other translations render Legge's "efficacious" as "magic," "sacred," "divine,"
"psyche," and "numinous." The line tells you that you are out of touch with what
is best in you and suggests a “victim,” a self-made loser, who has repudiated his
source of power or nourishment and then begs for sympathy because he “has
nothing.” Often the line can suggest that you have misread a previous oracle: i.e.,
"I already told you, but you paid no attention.”

So it will be seen that spiritual growth is best attained by getting fully to
grips with life in the world. It is a common pathology with esoterically
inclined students that they want to find the easiest way out of it. This
accounts for many of the "muzzy mystical" societies which give such a
bad name to occultism. In a genuine occult school the student should be
rammed good and hard into the maelstrom of life; and until he can cope
efficiently with the physical plane the higher planes of experience should
be barred to him -- for his own sake as well as others.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. You've lost touch with your spiritual Self.

B. Image of a "needy” victim. Grow up!
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one looking downwards for
nourishment, which is contrary to what is proper; or seeking it from the height
above, advance towards which will lead to evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Turning to the summit for nourishment, deviating from the
path to seek nourishment from the hill. Continuing to do this brings misfortune.

Blofeld: Nourishment on the mountain peak; he abandons normal ways to seek
nourishment in the hills -- misfortune! [From ancient times, there has been a
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

large body of opinion in China that Taoists and other mystics leading the life of
a recluse are odd people who have abandoned their duties to family, state and
mankind. However, the Book of Change, revered by both Taoists and
Confucians, is not likely to be guilty of bias; indeed, in the fourth place,
“nourishment on the mountain” brings good fortune. Perhaps the implication is
that those who withdraw from ordinary life more on account of their oddity
than because of any genuine desire for spiritual guidance waste their talents
and their time.]

Liu: Seeking nourishment from the top, one strays from the path to the hill. To
set forth leads to misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Toppling jaws. Rejecting the canons, tending-toward the
hill-top. Jaws chastising: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Say upside-down jaw; threshing the warp at the northern jaw; to
be upright is inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Perverting nourishment goes against the constant. Feeding on high
ground – to go brings misfortune.

Cleary(2): Perverting nourishment brushes aside the constant. Feeding on high
ground, an expedition bodes ill. [For those above to nourish those below is the
rational constant. Here one in a higher position is recessive and weak, and
relies on strength from below for nourishment; so this “brushes aside the
constant.]

Wu: There is reversed nurturing. It violates the normal order of offering nurture
to the one above. The action is foreboding. [The second (line) has the
responsibility of offering nurture to its correlate, the fifth (line). On the
contrary, it nurtures the one below, i.e., the first (line). Hence the judgment calls
the action a misplaced reversed nurturing.]

Hua-Ching Ni: One neglects the constancy and stability which can benefit life
and seeks nourishment from the wrong source. Misfortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The evil of her advance is because her movements abandon
her proper associates. Wilhelm/Baynes: In going it loses its place among its
kind. Blofeld: The misfortune is due to his having separated himself from his
own kind. Ritsema/Karcher: Movement letting-go sorting indeed. Cleary(2):
The action loses companionship. Wu: It is out of order.

Legge: The magnetic second line, insufficient for herself, seeks nourishment first
from the dynamic first line below, which is improper, and then from the dynamic
sixth line above, which is too far removed and also not her proper correlate. In
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

either case the thing is evil because neither of the dynamic lines is her proper
associate.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not provide for his own support. He improperly takes what
he needs from below and also cravenly begs for it from above. Such unworthiness
leads to misfortune.

Wing: Although you are able to properly nourish yourself in this situation, you
rely upon inappropriate methods or persons to fulfill your needs. If this
continues, it will rob you of your independence and create an unhealthy state of
mind. Difficulties will follow.

Editor: There seems to be disagreement among the translators about which
“order of nourishment” (above or below), is appropriate. Legge’s commentary
and Siu’s paraphrase offer the most coherent interpretations. The line usually
symbolizes one who doesn't know her proper place, who tries to exceed her
authority or go beyond herself. Issues pertaining to self-righteousness, spiritual
materialism and “wannabe gurus” are sometimes addressed here. The line can
also refer to shirking one's responsibility. For example, begging the oracle for
information one can easily decide for oneself.

If a man sleeps in a damp place, his back aches and he ends up half
paralyzed, but is this true of a loach? If he lives in a tree, he is terrified
and shakes with fright, but is this true of a monkey? Of these three
creatures, then, which one knows the proper place to live?
Chuang Tzu

A. You are seeking nourishment from inappropriate sources -- get back
where you belong.

B. Seeking that which is beneath you is base; seeking that which is beyond
your grasp is futile. Don’t strive above your proper station.

C. Take responsibility for yourself.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows one acting contrary to the method of
nourishing. However firm she may be, there will be evil. For ten years let her not
take any action, for it will not be advantageous in any way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Turning away from nourishment. Perseverance brings
misfortune. Do not act thus for ten years. Nothing serves to further.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Blofeld: He is determined to relinquish nourishment -- misfortune! For ten
years he performs no useful function and there is nowhere favorable for him to
go. [Such extreme eccentricity can only end in barrenness. Those familiar with
Buddhism will recollect that the Lord Buddha abandoned nourishment on the
advice of his teachers and then came to regret this fruitless method of self-
discipline.]

Liu: One turns away from nourishment. Continuing in this way brings
misfortune: no action for ten years, no benefit or advantage. [Owing to
misconduct there is a danger of encountering disaster, misfortune, or poor
health.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Rejecting Jaws. Trial: pitfall. Ten years-revolved, no
availing-of. Without direction: Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Threshing the jaw; determination is inauspicious; for ten years
do not use it; there is no place beneficial.

Cleary (1): Going against nourishment, even with rectitude this is inauspicious.
Don’t act on this for ten years; there is no benefit.

Cleary (2): Going against nourishment is inauspicious even if there is rectitude.
Do not act on this for ten years; there is nothing to be gained. [The weak cannot
nourish themselves; if they are also not balanced correctly and dwell on the
climax of action in this state, this is going against nourishment. Even though
there is a correct correspondence with the top yang, this cannot save them, and
they wind up useless. In Buddhism, it is like the senses deranging people so that
they lose their standards.]

Wu: It violates the principle of nurturing. Even if correct it is foreboding. It
loses its usefulness for ten years. There is nothing to be gained.

Hua-Ching Ni: The wrong kind of nourishment. This kind of nourishment may
look good for ten years, but in the end has no real benefit. Misfortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her course is greatly opposed to what is right. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It is all too contrary to the right way. Blofeld: Ten years because his
ways are utterly perverse. Ritsema/Karcher: Ten years-revolved, no availing-
of. Tao, the great rebelling indeed. Cleary(2): For the way is greatly confused.
Wu: Because it has violated the principle.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place, and because she is the last
line in the trigram of Movement, that quality culminates in her. She considers
herself self-sufficient, needing no help. The issue is bad.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Anthony: Only by firmly mastering our inferiors [i.e. our attitudes, complexes,
limiting beliefs] do we nourish ourself correctly.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Instead of solid accomplishments, the man pursues pleasures and self-
gratification. He will never achieve anything so long as he is surrounded by
dissipating temptations.

Wing: You cannot be fully nourished because you are too busy looking for
nourishment in the wrong places. In doing this, you turn away from others who
might help you, and therefore you achieve nothing. This is eccentric and
dangerous behavior.

Editor: The idea here is one of ignoring or repudiating what is necessary for
growth. Compare this line with the sixth line of hexagram 24: Return, which
Wilhelm translates as: “Missing the return. Misfortune. Misfortune from within
and without. If armies are set marching in this way, one will in the end suffer a
great defeat, disastrous for the ruler of the country. For ten years it will not be
possible to attack again.” Carefully examine the situation at hand to determine
where the source of error lies. This line can sometimes refer to “attitude”
problems – depression or pessimism that you cannot throw off despite knowing
that the Work transcends such illusions.

The difficulty in realizing this permanence of the essential self is, of
course, due to the fact that a person becomes so attached to the physical
vehicle and so connected with its activities, that the divine self is seldom
contacted.
G. Barborka -- The Pearl of the Orient

A. You have just made an egregious blunder.

B. Consider yourself reprimanded for getting off the path.

C. Your assumptions in the matter at hand are totally incorrect.

D. You have an attitude problem.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows one looking downwards for the power to
nourish. (Sic.) There will be good fortune. Looking with the downward
unwavering glare of a tiger, and with her desire that impels her to spring after
spring, she will fall into no error.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Wilhelm/Baynes: Turning to the summit for provision of nourishment brings
good fortune. Spying about with sharp eyes like a tiger with insatiable craving.
No blame.

Blofeld: Nourishment on the mountain peak -- good fortune! He glares like a
tiger stalking its prey so ardent is his look -- no error! [This line, like the second
line, suggests a recluse; but in this case he is well qualified for the spiritual life
and obviously gains the fruit of his endeavor. His tigerish glance calls to mind a
Master of Zen or, rather, a Taoist sage who has reached a similar stage of
enlightenment.]

Liu: Seeking nourishment from the top of the mountain brings good fortune.
One stares like a starving tiger stalking its prey. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Toppling jaws. Significant. Tiger observing: glaring, glaring.
His appetites: pursuing, pursuing. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Upside-down jaw; auspicious. The tiger looks with eyes
downcast, his appearance is so sad; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Reverse nourishment is auspicious. The tiger watches intently, about
to give chase. No fault.

Wu: There is reversed nurture. Auspicious. Like the attentive gazing of a tiger, he
chases after his desires. There will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This shows how brilliant will be the diffusion of the power
from her superior position. Wilhelm/Baynes: The one above spreads light.
Blofeld: The good fortune is due to light shed from above. Ritsema/Karcher:
Spreading-out shining above indeed. Cleary (2): Giving out light from above.
Wu: The favors from above are illustrious.

Legge: With line four we pass into the upper trigram. She is next to the ruler's
place in line five, and bent on nourishing and training all below. Her proper
correlate is the dynamic first line, and although she is weak in herself, she looks
with intense desire to the first line for help (Sic.), and there is no error.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man in a high position recognizes the need for able helpers to pursue
his lofty aims for the good of the people. He looks for the required talent with the
searching glare of a hungry tiger.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Wing: Any desire to energetically nourish others will meet with success. You are
in a position to be supportive and influential, although you may need to enlist
help. Look for clever people to aid you. There is no mistake in this.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all show this line turning upward to a summit
or mountain peak for her source of nourishment, and the Confucian
commentaries are rendered in terms of light shining down from above. Legge's
translation and commentary are not in accordance with this, and hence
misleading. The image is one of turning upward for the inspiration to nourish
those below. It suggests an ego gaining its power from the Self in order to
correctly nourish subordinate complexes within the psyche. The fourth line
represents the minister: symbolically, the ego as facilitator of the Work in
spacetime. The image of the tiger suggests the fervor of dedication to a higher
idea.

Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall
be filled.
Matthew 5: 6

A. A higher alliance creates the strength to manage inferior forces.

B. Turn toward your inner light, then reflect it into the world.

C. The ego follows higher principles to effect changes in subordinate
entities.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows one acting contrary to what is regular and
proper; but if she abides in firmness, there will be good fortune. She should not,
however, try to cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Turning away from the path. To remain persevering brings
good fortune. One should not cross the great water.

Blofeld: Normal ways are abandoned. Righteous persistence will bring good
fortune to those who stay where they are. The great river (or sea) must not be
crossed. [In such abnormal times, it is best to stay at home.]

Liu: One strays from the path. Remaining in the correct way brings good
fortune. Don't cross the great water. [With another's help, one will...achieve his
goals.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Rejecting the canons. Residing-in Trial significant. Not
permitting wading the Great River.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

Shaughnessy: Threshing the warp; determination about dwelling is auspicious;
one may not ford the great river.

Cleary (1): Going against the constant. It is good to abide in rectitude. It will not
do to cross great rivers.

Cleary (2): Brushing aside the constant, it is good to remain upright, but it will
not do to cross a great river.

Wu: It violates normal way of doing things. Should he stay firm, there will be
good fortune. He may not cross the big river.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune from abiding in firmness is due to her
docility in following the line above. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune comes
from following the one above devotedly. Blofeld: The good fortune attainable
by such people consists in being able to obey their superiors most willingly.
Ritsema/Karcher: Residing in Trial's significance. Yielding uses adhering-to
the above indeed. Cleary (2): What is good about remaining upright is following
those above docilely. Wu: The docility of following the one above.

Legge: Line five is not equal to the requirements of her position, but with a firm
reliance on the dynamic sixth line there will be good fortune. However, she
shouldn't engage in the most difficult undertakings.

Anthony: The Sage cannot make us strong. Although we are dependent on his
guidance, we must do the work of disciplining our inferiors.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man realizes his personal deficiencies in strength and knowledge to
discharge his assigned responsibilities. He seeks and follows the advice of a
spiritual superior, who is unknown to the public. Persevering under such
guidance will bring success. But he must recognize his dependency and not
assume great undertakings alone.

Wing: Although you are aware of the need to nourish and affect others, you lack
sufficient strength to do so unaided. You must take an indirect approach and
depend upon a strong superior to accomplish the deed. Don't try it on your own.

Editor: This line can suggest that an unconventional ("improper”) action is
justifiable under the prevailing conditions. Blofeld interprets the line in terms of
correctly abandoning normal procedures; Wilhelm and Liu render images of
getting off of a "proper” path, but still retaining appropriateness. Because this
fifth line ruler seeks help from the sixth line above, the image suggests an ego
obeying the higher laws of the Self. The implication is that some form of
27 -- Nourishment -- 27

unconventional action may be valid under the prevailing circumstances as long as
one doesn't attempt too much. In other words, the expected, conventional (or
your usual) response may be inappropriate in the current situation. Meditate to
obtain intuitive guidance.

The greatness of historical personalities has never lain in their abject
submission to convention, but, on the contrary, in their deliverance from
convention. They towered up like mountain peaks above the mass that
still clung to its collective fears, its beliefs, laws, and systems, and boldly
chose their own way. To the man in the street it has always seemed
miraculous that anyone should turn aside from the beaten track with its
known destinations, and strike out on the steep and narrow path leading
into the unknown.
Jung -- The Development of Personality

A. The ego looks to the Self for guidance and takes no action which is not
so inspired, even if this means that one appears unconventional.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows him from whom comes the nourishing.
His position is perilous, but there will be good fortune. It will be advantageous to
cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The source of nourishment. Awareness of danger brings
good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water.

Blofeld: Nourishment gives rise both to trouble and good fortune. It is
favorable to cross the great river (or sea). [Our quest for the necessities of mind
and body brings mixed results.]

Liu: Seeking the source of nourishment. Danger, good fortune. It is of benefit to
cross the great water.

Ritsema/Karcher: Antecedent Jaws. Adversity significant. Harvesting:
wading the Great River.

Shaughnessy: From the jaw; danger; auspicious; beneficial to ford the great
river.

Cleary (1): The source of nourishment; dangerous, but auspicious. It is
beneficial to cross great rivers.

Cleary (2): At the source of nourishment, it is good to be diligent, etc.

Wu: He nurtures all below him. With fortitude comes auspiciousness, etc.
27 -- Nourishment -- 27
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His good fortune, notwithstanding the peril of his position,
affords great cause for congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes: It has great blessing.
Blofeld: We shall enjoy great blessings. [`Blessings' means good fortune
apparently unconnected with our merits or endeavors.] Ritsema/Karcher:
The great possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): There will be great celebration.
Wu: There will be great joy.

Legge: The topmost line is dynamic, and line five relies on him. Being
penetrated with the idea of the hexagram, he feels himself in the position of
master or tutor to all under heaven. The task is hard and the responsibility great,
but realizing these things, he will prove equal to them.

Anthony: The source of nourishment comes from the Sage to ourself and from
ourself to others. Only by nourishing ourself correctly can we fulfill our
responsibility to nourish others. We “cross the great water” when we tend to this
inner nourishment, sorting out and resolutely discarding all the thoughts
fantasies, false comforts and self-deceptions that are unworthy of our inner
dignity. In this way we get past the dangers they create.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The sage educates others. Heavy responsibilities accompany such a
position. Awareness of the situation enables the man to accept great challenges
with success to the benefit of the people.

Wing: The person in this position has a highly developed awareness of what
is required in order to properly educate, influence, and nourish others. Should he
undertake this task, conscious of all the implications of his responsibilities, he
will bring happiness to many.

Editor: The internal, eternal Self is the evolving entity of the psyche. The
rewards of its cosmic adventure are worth all the perils involved. When action
originates from the Self, one flows toward one's destiny.

The desire for this kind of inner experience and self- development arises
from a psychic urge, a spiritual hunger -- akin to the need of satisfying
the hunger of the body -- that is present in very different degrees in
different persons. It is an expression of the instinctive drive to self-
preservation on a psychic, not a biological level. Those in whom it has
been aroused are compelled to strive for the satisfaction of its demands
or endure the pangs of spiritual hunger and eventual starvation.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

27 -- Nourishment -- 27

A. The Self is the source of all sustenance within the psyche. Action in
accordance with such a connection is always appropriate, regardless of
difficulties.

B. Follow your best intuition in the matter at hand.

Great Excess, The Passing of Greatness, Great Surpassing, Great Gains,
Experience, Greater than Great, Greatness in Excess, Dominance by the Mighty,
The Passing of Greatness, Excess of the Great, Law of Karma

Judgment

Legge: Critical Mass depicts a weak beam. Under such conditions it is
advantageous to move in any direction whatever. Success is indicated.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Preponderance of the Great. The ridgepole sags to the
breaking point. It furthers one to have somewhere to go. Success.

Blofeld: Excess! The ridgepole sags. It is favorable to have some goal (or
destination) in view. Success! [A glance at the hexagram will show that it is too
heavy in the middle and too weak at the ends. A number of firm lines is
generally auspicious, but there can be too much of a good thing!]

Liu: Great Excess. The ridgepole is crooked. It benefits to go anywhere.
Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Great Exceeding, the ridgepole sagging. Harvesting;
possessing directed going. Growing. [This hexagram describes your situation in
terms of your connection to a ruling principle. It emphasizes that pushing the
guiding idea beyond ordinary limits and accepting the results is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Great Surpassing: The ridgepole bows upward; beneficial to
have someplace to go; receipt.

Cleary (1): When the great is excessive, the ridgepole bends. It is good to go
somewhere; that is developmental. [When the ridgepole snaps, the whole house
falls down. In the same way, practitioners of the Tao who promote yang too
much, who do not know when enough is enough, who can be great but cannot be
small, suffer damage to their spiritual house.]

Cleary (2): When greatness passes, the ridgepole bends. It is beneficial to
have somewhere to go, for you will succeed.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Wu: Excess of the Great indicates a beam that warps. It will be advantageous
to have undertakings. It will be pervasive.

The Image

Legge: The image of trees beneath a marsh forms Critical Mass. The superior
man, in accordance with this, fearlessly stands alone, and stays retired from the
world without regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The lake rises above the trees: the image of
Preponderance of the Great. Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,
is unconcerned, and if he has to renounce the world, he is undaunted.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a forest submerged in a great body of water.
The Superior Man, though standing alone, is free from fear; he feels no
discontent in withdrawing from the world. [This is suggested by the component
trigrams. Water is necessary for the nourishment of the trees, but too much of it
can cause serious damage.]

Liu: The lake rising over the trees symbolizes Great Excess. The superior man,
when isolated, is undisturbed. If he has to retreat from society, he feels no regret.

Ritsema/Karcher: Marsh submerging wood. Great Exceeding. A chun tzu
uses solitary establishing not to fear. (A chun tzu uses) retiring-from the age
without melancholy.

Cleary (1): Moisture destroys wood in excess. Thus superior people stand alone
without fear, and leave society without distress.

Cleary (2): Moisture destroys wood. Developed people, etc. [Only when
sustained by the power to stand alone without fear and avoid society without
distress can learning be firmly rooted and development have a proper basis;
then it is possible to refine and support the mediocre.]

Wu: Marsh covers over wood; This is Excess of the Great. Thus the jun zi
stands alone without fear and withdraws from the world without melancholy.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Excess is weakly supported at either end, with weakness in
both the lowest and topmost lines. The dynamic lines are in excess, but two of
them are in the central positions. The trigrams of Flexibility and Satisfaction
indicate that there will be advantage in moving in any direction whatever -- there
will be success. Great indeed is the work to be done during this extraordinary
time.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Legge: Extraordinary times require extraordinary skill in their management.
The figure shows two magnetic lines at top and bottom, with four dynamic lines
between them -- giving the image of a great beam unable to sustain its own
weight. Lines two and five are both dynamic and central however, and from this
and the attributes of the component trigrams a good auspice is obtained.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: A stressful situation is best managed with a comprehensive strategy.
(Or: in the chess game of life, one succeeds by planning several moves in
advance.)

The Superior Man serves The Work by going his own way, regardless of public
opinion.

Wilhelm titles this hexagram Preponderance of the Great. I prefer
R.L. Wing's paraphrase of Critical Mass as more evocative of the figure's
meaning in modern terminology.

In Critical Mass four dynamic lines lurk inside of the hexagram, weakly
contained at top and bottom by two magnetic lines. This energetic concentration
could explode in an unpredictable release of force, and hence the Judgment tells
us to move now (remember: non-action is also action) to avoid unwanted
consequences. (Often the outcome is predictable – be prepared to just walk away
if and when that is your best move.)

Legge’s translation of the Judgment is:

"...It is advantageous to move in any direction whatever."

This is a different message than Wilhelm's:

"...It furthers one to have somewhere to go."

Legge’s version implies an almost hysterical flight from danger while
Wilhelm's rendition suggests prior intention and planning. The latter
interpretation is definitely what is meant here, as confirmed by Cleary’s Buddhist
commentary:

When the transformative path is flourishing, contaminations easily
arise; it is best to set up guidelines and regulations. When meditation
work is advanced, ignorance is about to dissolve; it is best to exercise the
mind skillfully.

Coupled with Cleary’s translation of the Image as: “Developed people
stand alone without fear, avoid society without distress,” the idea is that one
should follow one's best intuition and ignore popular illusions, political
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

correctness or inner fears. (Psychologically: conventional thinking, socially
conditioned reflexes, knee-jerk responses, etc.). During a time of Critical Mass,
pay close attention to direction from the Self to preserve the Work. This is not
the time to follow the crowd. Sometimes this can mean that you are obliged to go
it alone – one of the Work’s frequent tests (Cf. line 6):

The Gulf is something that has to be leaped, and leaped alone, stripped of
all hindering burdens, in faith ... It is thus one of the crisis points of
spiritual progress because of the great temptation to turn back from the
unknown to the apparent safety of known things, and to succumb to this
temptation is to lose all the fruits of past endeavor.
G. Knight -- A Practical Guide to Kabbalistic Symbolism

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare the Judgment and Image of this hexagram with those of
hexagram number 32, Consistency.

Anthony: We must regain modesty through the effort to rid ourself of strong
elements that cause us to press forward. The strong elements may exist in
someone else, causing them to assault us with their fear, mistrust or doubt.
Strong refers to impetuous movement to resolve what is ambiguous ... We can
meet the challenge by remaining detached and letting things go through their
changes ... To be truly rich is to remain modest; to be truly powerful is to remain
reticent.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows one placing mats of the white mao grass
under things set on the ground. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To spread white rushes underneath. No blame.

Blofeld: For mats, use white rushes -- no error! [White rushes are less common
than ordinary ones and probably make more beautiful mats. The implication
may be that, if we decide to do things rather nicely, we might as well go a little
further and do them as charmingly as possible.]

Liu: To spread white rushes below leads to no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: A sacrifice availing-of white thatch grass. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: For the mat use white cogon-grass; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Spreading white reeds; no fault.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Cleary (2): Spreading a mat of white reeds, there is no blame.

Wu: Use of white mats in making offerings is blameless.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She feels the weakness of being in the lowest place, and
uses extraordinary care. Wilhelm/Baynes: The yielding is underneath.
Blofeld: The reference is derived from the position of this yielding line
below so many firm ones. [A further commentary explains that they symbolize
treating things with gentleness.] Ritsema/Karcher: Supple located below
indeed. Cleary (2): Flexibility in a low position. Wu: Because the meek is in the
low position.

The Master said: To place the things on the ground might be considered
sufficient; but when one places mats of the white grass beneath them, what
occasion for blame can there be? Such a course shows the height of carefulness.
The white grass is a trivial thing, but through the use made of it, it may become
important. One who goes forward using such careful art will not fall into any
error.

Legge: The first line is magnetic, at the bottom of both the hexagram and the
lower trigram of Humility or Flexibility. Therefore she is distinguished by
carefulness, as in the matter mentioned, and there is a good auspice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man displays considerable care in embarking upon an
important enterprise.

Wing: When embarking on an important endeavor, it is necessary to pay
particular attention to details at the beginning. The times are indeed
extraordinary, and you must be particularly careful to proceed in the right way.
Being overcautious is not a mistake.

Editor: The idea is to lay a careful foundation for any enterprise to prevent later
instability. Make careful choices now to prevent evil consequences later on.

Don't you know that the beginning is the most important part of every
work and that this is especially so with anything young and tender? For
at that stage it's most plastic, and each thing assimilates itself to the
model whose stamp anyone wishes to give it.
Plato -- The Republic

A. Begin carefully.

B. Extreme caution is indicated.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows a decayed willow producing shoots, or
an old husband in possession of his young wife; there will be advantage in every
way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A dry poplar sprouts at the root. An older man takes a
young wife. Everything furthers.

Blofeld: The withered willow tree puts forth new shoots -- an old man takes to
wife a young girl. Everything is favorable.

Liu: The withered poplar tree sprouts new shoots. The old man marries a young
wife. Everything is favorable.

Ritsema/Karcher: A withered willow giving birth-to a sprig. A venerable
husband acquiring his woman consort. Without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: The bitter poplar gives life to sprouts: The old fellow gets his
maiden consort; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): A withered willow produces sprouts; an old man gets a girl for a wife.
Altogether beneficial.

Cleary (2): ... None do not benefit.

Wu: A withered willow tree grows a young shoot. An old man takes a young wife.
Everything is advantageous. [Ancient society gave approval to this kind of
matrimony for the desire of having children in the family. Willow trees like
water and do well on the bank of marshes. It is not uncommon for a withered
old tree to have new shoots.]

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Such association is extraordinary. Wilhelm/Baynes: The
extraordinary thing is their coming together. Blofeld: He weds her because they
have been overmuch together. [From his point of view, it is in any case a matter
for satisfaction, so it is taken here to symbolize favorable circumstances. Some
commentaries suggest another implication, namely that the old man is able to
take on tasks normally difficult for the elderly.] Ritsema/Karcher: Exceeding
uses mutual associating indeed. Cleary (2): (He) has her for a companion in
spite of being older. Wu: (They) will make a harmonious couple.

Legge: Line two has no proper correlate above, hence he inclines to the magnetic
first line below him. This suggests an old husband with a young wife who will yet
have children. The action will turn out favorably.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: An extraordinary reinvigoration occurs. During unusual occasions it may be
desirable to join the lowly in order to permit a new outlook and growth.

Wing: Look to those who are modest in attitude, or are beginners themselves, to
help you in your endeavors. This way you are in the company of persons who can
understand and share the enthusiasm of your goals. Things will move smoothly
and the situation will become revitalized.

Editor: The trigram for Wood beneath the trigram for a Lake or Marsh suggests
the idea of a tree that grows near water, hence: a willow tree. Whether dry,
withered, decayed or bitter, this old tree experiences an unexpected renewal of
life. The elderly husband and young wife are a different metaphor for the same
idea, and the symbolism can sometimes refer to a union of thought and feeling.
Psychologically implicit is the idea of intellect as mentor and guide to emotional
responses: an archetypal relationship.

In such dream wanderings one frequently encounters an old man who is
accompanied by a young girl, and examples of such couples are to be
found in many mythic tales.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. A fruitful renewal.

B. Old ideas are reinvigorated by fresh insights.

C. A creative balance of knowledge and ability.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows a beam that is weak. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The ridgepole sags to the breaking point. Misfortune.

Blofeld: The ridgepole sags -- misfortune!

Liu: The ridgepole bends under pressure; misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The ridgepole buckling. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The ridgepole sags; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The ridgepole bends; misfortune.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Cleary (2): The ridgepole bending is foreboding.

Wu: The beam warps. Foreboding.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: No help can be given to the condition thus represented.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The misfortune of the sagging and breaking of the ridgepole
is due to its finding no support. Blofeld: The misfortune of being without
adequate support. Ritsema/Karcher: Not permitted to use possessing bracing
indeed. Cleary (2): There is no way to help. Wu: Because no support will help.

Legge: The third line is dynamic in a dynamic place and confident in his own
strength. But his correlate line six is magnetic. Alone, he is unequal to the
extraordinary strain. Any attempt to sustain the broken beam will have no effect
in supporting the roof.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man becomes overconfident in his limited strength. He rushes ahead in
opposition to advice from those in a position to help. This leads to the loss of
voluntary support. His burdens increase, and he proves unequal to the task.

Wing: You are inclined to force your way forward when, in fact, there are
obstacles that cannot be overcome in this way. Even worse, you cannot accept
advice from others because it is not what you wish to hear. Misfortune will
inevitably follow.

Editor: This is the weak beam referred to in the Judgment. In the metaphor of
Wing’s title of Critical Mass, the situation is about to detonate

Owing to neglect the rooftree gives way;
for want of care the house lets in the rain.
Ecclesiastes 10: 18

A. The situation is unstable.

B. You have no support in the matter at hand.

C. Your assumptions have no foundation.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows a beam curving upwards. There will be
good fortune. If the subject of the line looks for other help but that of line one,
there will be cause for regret.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Wilhelm/Baynes: The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune. If there are ulterior
motives, it is humiliating.

Blofeld: The ridgepole is upheld -- good fortune! Were it otherwise, there would
be cause for blame.

Liu: The ridgepole is strengthened; good fortune. But something else may cause
humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: The ridgepole crowning. Significant. Possessing more:
abashment.

Shaughnessy: The ridgepole bows upward; auspicious; there is harm; distress.

Cleary (1): The ridgepole is raised; good fortune. There is another shame.

Cleary (2): ... This is auspicious, but there is another shame.

Wu: The beam is held upright, and there will be good fortune. There may be
humiliation in unexpected situations.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune arises because it does not bend toward
what is below. Wilhelm/Baynes: It does not sag downward and break.
Blofeld: Good fortune in the sense that it does not fall. [This would seem to be
good fortune of a negative kind; not so much good fortune as the failure of
expected bad fortune to materialize.] Ritsema/Karcher: Not sagging,
reaching-to the below indeed. Cleary (2): It does not bend down. Wu: The
beam (is) held upright, not warping downward.

Legge: Line four is just below the fifth line ruler. His duty is to meet the
extraordinary exigency of the time. Although dynamic, he is in a magnetic place
and his strength is tempered -- he will be equal to his task. Should he seek help
from line one, that would affect him with another element of weakness, and his
action would give cause for regret.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man becomes the master of the difficult situation by refusing the
assistance of weak men. He relies on his own strength of character.

Wing: You can now find within yourself the strength and vision to achieve a
successful outcome in your endeavors. Do not rely upon people or things outside
of your Self for guidance. Dependence now on external things leads to
humiliation.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Editor: This is one of those maddening lines of which every translator renders a
subtly different version. Some aren't even internally consistent: Legge's
translation says that there will be cause for regret if the subject "looks for other
help but that of line one,” which I take to mean: "Only line one is the proper
source of assistance.” Inexplicably, his exposition then cautions against such
assistance, as does his Confucian commentary. Blofeld's version is a tautology
effectively removing serious warning from the line. The Wilhelm and Liu
translations are least confusing and imply that we are protected as long as we
suppress our lower impulses and maintain allegiance to a higher principle. In my
experience, this interpretation has been most accurate.

The patient must be alone if he is to find out what it is that supports him
when he can no longer support himself. Only this experience can give
him an indestructible foundation.
Jung -- Psychology and Alchemy

A. The Work is protected if you keep the faith.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows a decayed willow producing flowers, or an
old wife in possession of her young husband. There will be occasion neither for
blame nor for praise.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A withered poplar puts forth flowers. An older woman takes
a husband. No blame. No praise.

Blofeld: The withered willow tree puts forth blossom -- an old woman takes a
vigorous young husband; no blame, no praise! [No blame, in that there is no
prohibition against such marriages; no praise, in that they are generally
considered far more unsuitable than when the husband is much older than the
wife.]

Liu: A withered poplar blossoms. An old woman gains a young husband: No
blame, no praise.

Ritsema/Karcher: A withered willow giving-birth-to flowers. A venerable wife
acquiring her notable husband. Without fault, without praise.

Shaughnessy: The bitter poplar gives life to flowers: the old wife gets her siring
husband; there is no trouble, there is no praise.

Cleary (1): A withered willow produces flowers, and old woman gets a
young man for a husband: no blame, no praise.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Wu: A withered willow tree grows a flower. An old woman takes a young
husband. There will be neither blame nor praise.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A decayed willow produces flowers, but how can this secure
its long continuance? An old wife and a young husband is also a thing to be
ashamed of. Wilhelm/Baynes: How could this last long? It is nevertheless a
disgrace. Blofeld: How can such blossom endure for long? From another point
of view, both of them should feel ashamed. [The question of blaming or praising
such a marriage is in any case of little importance, since it can scarcely be
destined to endure for long. The second sentence of the commentary perhaps
reveals that, for once, Confucius was inclined to disagree with his beloved
mentor, the Book of Change, and to be taken aback by the words "no blame."
From the point of view of divination, lines of this sort do not always indicate
marriage; this line could mean that we shall do or have done something rather
unusual of which the results will be more or less negative.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Wherefore permitting lasting indeed? Truly permitting the demoniac indeed.
Cleary (2): How can they last? (It) can also be embarrassing. Wu: How long
can it last? (They) make an awkward couple.

Legge: Line five is dynamic and central and should be able to achieve
extraordinary merit. But he has no proper correlate below, and as line two is
inclined to line one, so is line five inclined to line six. But here the willow only
produces flowers, not shoots -- its decay will soon reappear. An old wife will have
no children. If the line is not to be condemned like line three, neither does his
action deserve praise. The shoots produced in line two will grow into a new and
vigorous tree, but here the flowers will soon decay, and the withered trunk
continue the same. For what will a young man marry an old woman? There will
be no children; it can only be from some mercenary motive.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Notwithstanding promising potentialities the man gives up his alliances
with the people below him and seeks the company only of those of higher rank.
An unstable arrangement results. Instead of greater security, there will be less.
No renewal occurs after the flower saps the tree's remaining energy.

Wing: In critical or significant times it is exhausting to cling to your ideals and
ignore the realities of your environment. These realities are the superstructure
that supports your life. If you ignore your foundations in your reach upward, you
will become unstable and accomplish nothing at all.

Editor: Notice that the original line says that there will be neither praise nor
blame. It is the Confucian commentary, written many hundreds of years later,
that attaches the idea of "shame” to this position. Following Confucius, Blofeld's
footnote also interprets the results as negative: but this is not really warranted
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

from the line itself. The image is a reasonable portrayal of an inconclusive,
fruitless or trivial situation. The condition emblemed is one of marking time:
marching in place. Psychologically interpreted, the wife can symbolize an
emotional component of the psyche: a desire or feeling; the husband would be a
mental component: perhaps discrimination. If this is the only changing line, the
new hexagram becomes number thirty-two: Consistency, with a corresponding
line that confirms the ineffectual condition.

While man is a soul in essence he may, while incarnate in flesh, forget his
real origins and indeed live out his whole existence in an animal [like] or
vegetable [like] consciousness.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree

A. Marking time, treading water -- a harmless but fruitless diversion.

B. A flare-up of an old condition. Something returns, flowers, and dies to
no particular purpose.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with extraordinary boldness
wading through a stream, till the water hides the crown of her head. There will
be evil, but no ground for blame.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One must go through the water. It goes over one's head.
Misfortune. No blame.

Blofeld: While he was fording the river, the water rose above his head --
misfortune, but he was not at fault.

Liu: One walks through the water and it goes over his head. Misfortune, no
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Exceeding wading submerges the peak. Pitfall. Without
fault.

Shaughnessy: Surpassing and fording causes the top of the head to vanish;
inauspicious; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Excess reaching the peak of destruction is unfortunate; there is no
blame on other people. [At the end of Excess of the Great, being ignorant and
acting arbitrarily, not knowing the medical substances or the firing process,
doing whatever comes to mind, going astray and not returning, the damage is
worse the higher one goes; excess reaches the peak of destruction. One calls
misfortune upon oneself – it is no fault of others. This is Excess of the Great
in the sense of being weak and entertaining illusions.]
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

Cleary (2): Going too far, passing away at the peak, there is misfortune, but no
blame. [Here are only the virtues of flexibility and uprightness, without the
ability to solve difficulties, so misfortune cannot be avoided; but one is really
not to blame. In Buddhist terms, this is when correct concentration has no
insight, winding up as a fall at the peak.]

Wu: He is drowned while crossing the river. This is foreboding, but blameless.

CONFUCIAN COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Evil follows wading with extraordinary boldness through the
stream, but the act affords no ground for blame. Wilhelm/Baynes: One should
not join blame to the misfortune of going through the water. Blofeld: This
presages a misfortune for which we cannot possibly be blamed. Ritsema/
Karcher: Not permitting fault indeed. Cleary (2): The misfortune of going too
far cannot be blamed. Wu: The ill fortune of getting drowned should not be a
cause for blame.

Legge: The sixth line pursues her daring course with an intent to rectify the
extraordinary exigency of the time and benefit all under the sky. She is unequal
to the task and sinks beneath it, but her motive justifies the judgment on her
conduct.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man pursues his objectives for the public good, regardless of the
consequences and danger. Misfortune results. But no blame is attached to his
conduct, because there are certain things more important than life itself.

Wing: The goal is worth accomplishing, although the sacrifice to attain it may
be confounding in its enormity. No blame is attached to such action, although
you should realize the extraordinary reality of what is happening.

Anthony: It is careless to wish to accomplish our task, no matter what happens.
Plunging ahead on our own is always dangerous and willful. It is best to retain
carefulness, allowing ourself to be guided. Meanwhile, having followed our
principles is without blame, even though the result may be dangerous.

Editor: Like any line in the I Ching, this one is open to more than one
interpretation. It can suggest suffering while undertaking a necessary but difficult
task, or it can portray one ignorantly “pushing the river” in pursuit of goals one
doesn’t really understand. Legge's commentary about being “unequal to the task”
is not explicit in the original line -- i.e.: failure is not necessarily a foregone
conclusion. Life's lessons are often painful -- that's just the way it is, and you are
not to blame for it. Cleary (1)’s mention of “medical substances, etc.,” refers to
Taoist alchemical procedures.
28 -- Critical Mass -- 28

29 -- Danger --29
HEXAGRAM NUMBER TWENTY-NINE –
DANGER

Other titles: The Abysmal, The Symbol of Sinking, Water, The Abyss, Gorge,
Repeating Gorge, Repeated Entrapment, Double Pitfall, Multiple Danger, Double
Water, The Deep, Dark Forces, The Perilous Pit, "May not be as bad as it sounds,
but whatever happens, remain true to yourself." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: The trigram of Danger, here repeated, shows the possession of sincerity,
through which the mind is penetrating. Action in accordance with this will be of
high value.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Abysmal repeated. If you are sincere, you have
success in your heart, and whatever you do succeeds.

Blofeld: Abyss upon abyss -- grave danger! All will be well if confidence is
maintained and a sharp hold kept upon the mind; activities so conducted will win
esteem.

Liu: Water doubled. Danger. Sincerity leads to success (peacefulness) in your
heart and mind. You will succeed in your actions. [This hexagram means
danger, misfortune, or entanglement in a difficult situation... You should be
both careful and patient; do not struggle with all of the difficulties around you.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Repeating Gorge. Possessing conformity. Holding-fast
the heart Growing. Movement possesses honor. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of a dangerous situation you cannot avoid. It emphasizes that
taking the risk without reserve, the action of Gorge, is the adequate way to
handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: venture and fall!]

Shaughnessy: Repeated Entrapment: There is a return; the appended
heart; receipt; in motion there will be elevation.

Cleary (1): In mastering pitfalls there is truthfulness; thus the mind develops.
There is excellence in practice.

Cleary (2): In multiple danger, if there is sincerity, the mind gets through
and action has value.
29 -- Danger --29

Wu: Entrapment indicates there is confidence. The heart of the matter is that
it is pervasive. Actions taken in its accord will be commendable.

The Image

Legge: The image of water flowing on continuously forms the repeated trigram
of Danger. The superior man, in accordance with this, maintains constantly the
virtue of his heart and the sincerity of his conduct, and practices the business of
instruction.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal. The
image of the Abysmal repeated. Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue
and carries on the business of teaching.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes water flowing on and on and abyss upon
abyss. [The trigram K'an is usually inauspicious; here it occurs in duplicate as
the upper and the lower trigram; thus the implication is that we are beset by
grave dangers from which, if we can escape them at all, the utmost skill and
confidence will be required to extricate ourselves.] The Superior Man acts in
accordance with the immutable virtues and spends much of his time instructing
others in the conduct of affairs.

Liu: Water flows unceasingly into the depths symbolizing Water doubled.
The superior man constantly preserves his virtue and practices his task of
education.

Ritsema/Karcher: Streams reiterating culminating. Repeating Gorge. A
chun tzu uses rules actualizing-tao to move. [A chun tzu uses] repeating to teach
affairs. [Actualize-tao, TE: realize tao in action; power, virtue; ability to
follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with
acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to
be.]

Cleary (1): Water travels, double water. Thus do superior people consistently
practice virtue and learn how to teach.

Cleary (2): Water comes repeatedly – multiple danger. Developed people
practice teaching by constant virtuous action. [This is in perfect accord with the
Tiantai Buddhist teaching of knowing how to get through an impasse, the
method of making an impasse itself into a way through; this is also the method
of skillfully using natural ills.]

Wu: Water comes time and again; this is Entrapment. Thus the jun zi practices
virtuous conduct and reviews didactics.
29 -- Danger --29
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Danger repeated shows us one defile succeeding another.
This is the nature of water -- it flows on, without accumulating its volume so as to
overflow; it pursues its way through a dangerous defile, without losing its true
nature. That the mind is penetrating is indicated by the dynamic line in the
center. Advance in accordance with this will be followed by achievement. The
dangerous height of heaven cannot be ascended; the difficult places of the earth
are mountains, rivers, hills and mounds. Kings and princes arrange, by means of
such strengths, to maintain their territories. Great indeed is the use of what is
here taught about seasons of peril.

Legge: The trigram of Danger which is doubled to form this hexagram is the
symbol of water, and means a pit, a perilous cavity or defile with water flowing
through it. The trigrams consist of a dynamic central line between two magnetic
lines. Together they symbolize danger -- how it should be encountered, its effects
on the mind, and how to escape from it.

Liang Yin says: "Water stops at the proper time, and moves at the proper
time. Is not this an emblem of the course of the superior man in dealing with
danger?”

The K'ang-hsi editors say that to exercise one's self in meeting difficulty
and peril is the way to establish and strengthen the character, and the use of such
experience is seen in all measures for self-defense.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Commitment to the Work engenders a keen discernment of
threatening situations and the factors which create them. With the ability to
recognize the dangerous elements in a situation, success is assured.

The Superior Man maintains his connection with the Self and learns from the
trials thus provided.

This is one of the first hexagrams that one learns to recognize by name and
number, and it is usually received with trepidation. Like the Death card in Tarot,
it is often interpreted as an evil omen, although a deeper understanding reveals
opportunity rather than defeat in such images.

There is danger and suffering in the Work, but probably far less of it (in
the long run) than in an ordinary unexamined life. Anguish in the service of
purpose is ultimately tolerable -- it is the incredible suffering of ignorance that is
truly tragic: all that pain and sorrow expended on worldly illusions!

The Confucian commentary provides some valuable insights concerning
the defensive use of danger by kings and princes to protect their realms. To
29 -- Danger --29

master a dangerous challenge before one can progress to a higher level of
awareness is a classical theme of initiation: without it, the candidate would be
destroyed by forces he wasn't ready to confront. (This is the purpose and
meaning behind of the "Guardian of the Threshold" archetype.) Danger is evil or
unfortunate only if one is intimidated by it -- correct behavior in accordance with
the principles of the Work will always take you to your destination. The Self will
seldom, if ever, give you a test that you cannot pass if you fully apply yourself.
When it seems otherwise, bear in mind that failure often renders better lessons
than success, or the illusion thereof.

A neurosis is by no means merely a negative thing, it is also something
positive. Only a soulless rationalism reinforced by a narrow
materialistic outlook could possibly have overlooked this fact. In reality
the neurosis contains the patient's psyche, or at least an essential part of
it; and if, as the rationalist pretends, the neurosis could be plucked from
him like a bad tooth, he would have gained nothing but would have lost
something very essential to him. That is to say, he would have lost as
much as the thinker deprived of his doubt, or the moralist deprived of his
temptation, or the brave man deprived of his fear. To lose a neurosis is
to find oneself without an object; life loses its point and hence its
meaning. This would not be a cure, it would be a regular amputation.
Jung -- Civilization in Transition

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject in the double defile, and yet
entering a cavern within it. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Repetition of the Abysmal. In the abyss one falls into a pit.
Misfortune.

Blofeld: Abyss upon abyss! In one of them, he tumbles into a cranny --
misfortune!

Liu: Water flows repeatedly. One falls into the pit of water. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repeating Gorge. Entering tending-towards the Gorge, the
recess. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Repeated entrapment; entering the trap pit; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Repeating pitfalls, one goes into a hole in a pit: bad results.

Cleary (2): Multiple danger, going into a hole in a pit, leads to misfortune.

Wu: Entrapment enters into the depths of a pit. There will be foreboding.
29 -- Danger --29
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has missed her proper way, and there will be evil.
Wilhelm/Baynes: One falls into the abyss because one has lost the way; this
brings misfortune. Blofeld: Namely the misfortune of getting lost upon the way.
Ritsema/Karcher: Letting-go tao: pitfall indeed. Cleary (2): The misfortune
of losing the way. Wu: The misfortune of losing the way.

Legge: Line one is magnetic at the bottom of the figure, and has no correlate to
help her. This renders her situation as hopeless. By her own efforts she will only
make matters worse.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is hopelessly in danger. As a consequence of allowing
himself to grow accustomed to evil, he has lost the right way. His efforts will only
embroil him more deeply.

Wing: You have become accustomed to evil influences and no longer fight them.
This could be the result of a weakness in your character. In any event, you've lost
your way. The more action you take, the farther afield you'll stray. Begin again at
another time.

Editor: There is no ambiguity here: To enter a cavern within a labyrinth, or
"double defile" is to make things hopelessly worse.

Having once strayed into the labyrinth of evils, the wretched Soul finds
no way out.
Naassene Psalm

A. You have lost your way and are surrounded by negative forces.

B. An image of confusion compounded -- you are making a bad situation
worse.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject in all the peril of the defile.
He will, however, get a little of the deliverance that he seeks.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The abyss is dangerous. One should strive to attain small
things only.

Blofeld: Danger lurks within the abyss; only in small matters can he obtain
what he desires.
29 -- Danger --29

Liu: There is danger in the abyss. One should work for small gains only.

Ritsema/Karcher: Gorge possessing venturing. Seeking, the small acquiring.

Shaughnessy: The trap has depth; in seeking there is a little gain.

Cleary (1): There is danger in a pitfall. One finds a small gain. [Dwelling in the
middle of two yins, daily in the company of petty people and not knowing to
approach people imbued with Tao, one will ultimately fall and become a fool,
just as there is danger in a pitfall.]

Cleary (2): ... One seeks a small gain.

Wu: There is danger in Entrapment. It is all right to seek small gains.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He will not yet escape from his environed position.
Wilhelm/Baynes: "One should strive to attain small things only." For the
middle has not yet been passed. Blofeld: Though he obtain these trifles, he
remains within the abyss. [Whatever small successes we may win will not have
any effect in lessening the danger that threatens.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Not-yet
issuing-forth-from the center indeed. Cleary (2): Not yet gotten out of the
middle. Wu: He has not stepped out of the center of danger.

Legge: Line two is dynamic and in the center. Although unable to escape the
danger completely, at least he doesn't involve himself more deeply in it like the
first line does, and therefore he obtains a measure of relief.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A person in danger should not try to escape at one stroke. He should first
calmly hold his own, then be satisfied with small gains, which will come by
creative adaptations.

Wing: The danger is great and cannot be surmounted with one single action.
Small, consistent efforts to stay afloat in a sea of difficulties are all that are
possible at this time.

Editor: The image portrays a tight spot -- calm awareness of the realities of the
situation enables one to prevail without panic. Go with the flow until an exit
presents itself. In psychological terms, it is possible that inner forces are being
stressed for integration -- the ego can only destroy the Work by giving them an
outlet.
29 -- Danger --29

Knowledge of good is sharpened by experience of evil in those incapable
of any sure knowledge of evil unless they have experienced it.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. Don't fight dark forces -- adapt to your situation until you can escape.

B. A dangerous though stable position -- remain calm and don't rock the
boat.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject, whether she comes or goes,
descends or ascends, confronted by a defile. All is peril to her and unrest. Her
endeavors will lead her into the cavern of the pit. There should be no action in
such a case.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Forward and backward, abyss on abyss. In danger like this,
pause at first and wait, otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss. Do not act in
this way.

Blofeld: Abyss upon abyss rears up and the danger is acute. He falls into a
cranny and there is nothing he can do to help himself.

Liu: Water flows on and on. One is in the pit of the abyss. Danger. Do not act.

Ritsema/Karcher: Coming's Gorge, the Gorge. Venturing moreover reclining.
Entering tending-towards the Gorge, the recess. No availing-of.

Shaughnessy: Bringing it so entrappedly, both steep and deep; entering the
trap pit; do not use it.

Cleary (1): Coming and going, pitfall upon pitfall, dangerous and obstructed,
going into a hole: Don’t act this way.

Wu: There is danger in coming and there is danger in going. The subject is in
danger and is stopped from exiting. He enters into the depths of a pit and nothing
useful will come out of it.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She will never in such circumstances achieve any success.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Here any effort ends up as impossible. Blofeld: This
presages our ultimate failure to accomplish anything at all. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Completing without achieving indeed. Cleary (2): In the end there is no
accomplishment. Wu: In the end nothing will be accomplished.
29 -- Danger --29

Legge: Line three is magnetic and occupies the place of a dynamic line. She is in
an evil case. She goes and comes, moves up and down, backwards and forwards,
making no advance. This can be of no use in extracting her from the danger.

Anthony: Every step leads to danger. Our attitude has brought out elements in
others which further expose us to difficulty. We should take refuge in neutrality
and disengagement until a way out shows itself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man becomes entangled in danger at every turn. He should refrain
from action, which only worsens the situation, and wait until the solution reveals
itself.

Wing: You are surrounded by danger and you do not understand it. Any action
will only make matters worse. Maintain your principles and wait for the solution
to reveal itself.

Editor: Here is an image of raw panic -- the fear of a trapped animal: a bird in a
house mindlessly battering itself against a plate-glass window. Hysteria is a
grossly futile and incompetent response to stress: a demeaning lack of self-
control. Get a grip on yourself!

Disquietude is always vanity, because it serves no good. Yes, even if
the whole world were thrown into confusion and all things in it,
disquietude on that account would be vanity.
Saint John of the Cross

A. Stop right now! Calm down and wait it out.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject at a feast, with simply a
bottle of spirits, and a subsidiary basket of rice, while the cups and bowls are only
of earthenware. She introduces her important lessons as her ruler's intelligence
admits. There will in the end be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it; earthen vessels simply
handed in through the window. There is certainly no blame in this.

Blofeld: A flagon of wine and a bamboo food-basket -- both. These objects were
handed to him through a hole in the rock. To the very end he remains free from
blame. [The terrible trouble in which we find ourselves occurs through no fault
of ours; others are able to help us to some extent -- but it looks as though their
help may serve only to prolong our agony.]
29 -- Danger --29

Liu: A jug of wine. Two bowls of food should be put into an earthen container
and passed through the window. There is no blame in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: A cup, liquor, a platter added. Availing-of a jar. Letting-in
bonds originating-from the window. Completing, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Offering wine and tureens in pairs; use earthenware. Take in the
angelica from the window; in the end there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): One jug of wine, two vessels. Use simplicity, sincerity, and openness,
and in the end there will be no fault.

Cleary (2): A jug of wine with a ceremonial vessel of grain alongside. Use a plain
cup; take in a pledge through the window. In the end there is no fault.

Wu: Using a jar of wine and a bamboo basket of food with ordinary table
earthenware, he presents himself at the window. In the end, he will be blameless.
[The judgment describes a person in a precarious position (the fourth)
presenting himself in a simple way to his ruler (the fifth). The scene may also be
viewed as a loyal minister offering his counsel to his king in time of crisis.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This describes the meeting of the dynamic and magnetic
lines. Wilhelm/Baynes: It is the boundary between firm and yielding.
Blofeld: This passage is suggested by the nature of the line, which forms a
border between yielding and firm. Ritsema/Karcher: Solid and Supple, the
border indeed. Cleary (2): The border of hard and soft. Wu: The meeting of the
strong and weak.

Legge: Line four is the magnetic minister who will get no help from her first line
correlate. She can't avert the danger herself, but she is close to the fifth line ruler
whom she cautiously enlightens with the sincerity of her simple nourishment.
Consequently, there will be no error.

Anthony: The Sage, knowing that we are in danger, voluntarily comes to our aid.
Consequently, we are enlightened by a breakthrough in our understanding.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is without a sponsor because of the lack of impressive gifts.
Ceremonial forms and expensive gifts are unnecessary, however, during periods
of great urgency. Spurred on by unostentatious sincerity, he presents his
thoughts directly to the chief. No error will result from this honest request for
mutual help during times of peril.
29 -- Danger --29

Wing: Take the simple and direct approach to solving your problems and
overcoming difficulties. Strive for clarity of mind. Do not clutter your actions with
useless pretense, since it will only confuse the situation.

Editor: This image implies that the dangerous elements in the situation are
caused by some kind of complexity -- vanity, bureaucracy, or Byzantine
intellectualism perhaps. Whatever it is, a return to basics is indicated. While
surrounded by a feast (of choices) one partakes only of simple nourishment
(options).

In order to effect a constructive and lasting change in our lives we must
strive toward a transformation of the potentially disrupting or disruptive
complexes by reaching their archetypal cores. Such a transformation
can occur only when we have gone beyond the personal dimension to the
universal. This process is sustained by guidance from the objective
psyche through dreams and fantasies.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Reduce the situation to its lowest common denominator and proceed
from there.

B. Complexity demands patience. Nourish yourself on simplicity.

C. An educational process. The image suggests patience and gradual
change.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the water of the defile not yet full, so that
it might flow away; but order will soon be brought about. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The abyss is not filled to overflowing. It is filled only to the
rim. No blame.

Blofeld: The abyss is not filled to the brim; the flowing water maintains its level
-- no error!

Liu: The water does not overflow its bounds. The waves are calm. No blame.
[People will achieve their goals smoothly and without endangering themselves.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Gorge not overfilled. Merely already evened. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The trap is not filled, but the sandbar has been flattened; there is
no trouble.

Cleary (1): The pit is not full, it has only reached level; there is no blame.
29 -- Danger --29

Cleary (2): The pit is not filled, only leveled. No blame.

Wu: Entrapment is not full. It is level and uneventful. There will be no blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The virtue indicated by the central situation is not yet
sufficiently great. Wilhelm/Baynes: The central line is not yet great. Blofeld:
This is because the line, being central to the upper trigram, indicates a level that
is not too high. [The danger threatening whoever receives a moving line for the
fifth place is relatively less serious than for many of the others whose enquiries
are answered by this unfortunate hexagram.] Ritsema/Karcher: Centering,
not-yet great indeed. Cleary (2): The center is not yet great. Wu: The center
has not manifested its greatness.

Legge: Line five is dynamic in its proper place as ruler, and on the verge of
deliverance from danger. The waters of the abyss will soon disappear and the
ground be made level and smooth.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is almost extricated, but remains in danger because of excessive
ambition. He does not learn from the water's example of rising only to the lowest
point of the rim to flow out of a ravine. He should not attempt great and
apparently unattainable things but should only try to escape danger by following
the path of least resistance.

Wing: Only struggle as much as necessary to extricate yourself from your
problems. Overly ambitious persons who attempt more than they should may
create further difficulties. It is indicated here that the danger will pass of its own
accord.

Editor: This depicts the crest of the flood, or just before the crest.
Psychologically, the water is contained, and the unconscious forces do not
overwhelm the psyche. Legge's Confucian commentary ("The virtue indicated by
the central situation is not yet sufficiently great") is not convincing in the
context of what is imaged. Blofeld's rendition suggests a more credible
interpretation: the rising waters are not great enough to overflow their banks.
This gives an image of the strong fifth line ruler as centered and able to cope with
the danger surrounding him. In other words, the cup is full, but not over-full.
The situation is dangerous, but not overwhelming. The dark forces have reached
their maximum power -- now they can only wane.

Who pent up the sea behind closed doors when it leaped tumultuous out
of the womb... when I marked the bounds it was not to cross and made it

29 -- Danger --29

fast with a bolted gate? Come thus far, I said, and no farther: here your
proud waves shall break.
Job 38: 8-11

A. Danger peaks and stabilizes. Though perilous, the situation is
contained.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject bound with cords of three
strands or two strands, and placed in the thicket of thorns. But in three years she
does not learn the course for her to pursue. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Bound with cords and ropes, shut in between thorn-hedged
prison walls: for three years one does not find the way. Misfortune.

Blofeld: Bound with black ropes and imprisoned amidst thorns, for three years
he fails to obtain what he seeks. [This situation is far from cheerful, but not as
hopeless as the situation of those who receive moving lines in the second and
third places.]

Liu: Tied with thick ropes, one is put in prison among thorn bushes. One cannot
find the way for three years. Misfortune. [If you receive this line, avoid all
entanglements, both physical and mental. Be cautious, or you will be detained.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Tying availing-of stranded ropes. Dismissing
tending-towards dense jujube-trees. Three year's-time, not acquiring. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The attachment uses braids and cords: place him in the clumped
thorn bushes, for three years not getting him; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Bound with rope, put in a briar patch, for three years one cannot find
the way out; misfortune.

Cleary (2): ... Helpless for three years – misfortune.

Wu: He is tied with black ropes and surrounded by thorny vines. He cannot set
himself free for three years. Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She misses her proper course -- there will be evil for three
years. Wilhelm/Baynes: This misfortune continues for three years. Blofeld:
The line indicates that we lose our way and suffer misfortune for three years.
Ritsema/Karcher: Pitfall: three year's-time indeed. Cleary (2): The top yin
29 -- Danger --29

loses the way, unfortunate for three years. Wu: The sixth yin violates the proper
way of doing things and the violation results in the misfortune for three years.

Legge: The case of line six is hopeless. When danger has reached its peak, there
she is -- yielding, without a proper correlate. The thicket of thorns is a metaphor
for a prison.

Anthony: Misfortune comes because we press on, taking matters into our
hands. This line warns of the failure we may expect in maintaining this attitude
and notes the obstinacy that has brought us to this impasse. The remedy is to
return to the path of perseverance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is hopelessly enmeshed in his own faults after missing the proper
course. No chances of escape are apparent.

Wing: None of your solutions or efforts have been appropriate. The way out of
danger is blocked. There will come a long time of disorder. All you may do is
wait.

Editor: On the face of it, there is little ambiguity in this line -- it depicts one who
is severely confined because of not knowing the proper course to pursue. If we
closely examine the psychological symbols of this restriction however, we see
deeper into the possible reasons for it. Chetwynd, in his Dictionary of
Symbols identifies cords or ropes with links to the inner psyche -- the umbilical
cord being the connection to the Mother, or source of our physical-emotional
being. He also points out that thorns are a common symbol of the dark side of
the Mother principle. To be bound with cords and imprisoned by thorns then, is
to be trapped in a "womb" of primitive emotional darkness, or suffocated by some
entity which does not want to evolve into conscious awareness.

The rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world and they all
follow, but not being strong enough they are carried round below the
surface, plunging, treading on one another, each striving to be first; and
there is confusion and perspiration and the extremity of effort; and many
of them are lamed or have their wings broken through the ill-driving of
the charioteers; and all of them after a fruitless toil, not having attained
to the mysteries of true being, go away, and feed upon opinion.
Plato -- Phaedrus

A. You have lost your way and are imprisoned by illusions.

B. Your limiting beliefs prevent you from furthering the Work.

Flaming Beauty, Radiance, Fire, The Net, Allegiance, The Cosmic Mean, Synergy,
Sunlight, Perception, Pertaining to Comprehension, The Light, Consciousness,
Lucidity

Judgment

Legge: The free course and success of Clarity comes from firm correctness. The
nourishment of bovine docility creates good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Clinging. Perseverance furthers. It brings success.
Care of the cow brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Flaming beauty. Righteous persistence brings reward. Success!
Rearing cows -- good fortune! [Cows are gentle creatures which require looking
after; hence this sentence means that good fortune can be gained by looking
after those in need of help.]

Liu: Fire. It is of benefit to continue. Success. To take care of the cow leads to
good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Radiance, Harvesting Trial. Growing. Accumulating
female cattle. Significant. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
expanding light, warmth and awareness. It emphasizes that joining with and
depending on what spreads this light, the action of Radiance, is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: The Net: Beneficial to determine; receipt; raising a cow is
auspicious.

Cleary(1): Fire is beneficial for correctness and development. Raising a cow
brings good fortune.

Cleary (2): Fire is beneficial if correct; then there is success, etc. [In Buddhism,
when demons cause disturbance, it is necessary to cleave to true teaching to get
rid of aberrations.]

Wu: Allegiance indicates that it will be advantageous to be persevering and
pervasion will follow. It will be auspicious to raise the cow.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

The Image

Legge: The image of brightness repeated forms Clarity. The great man, in
accordance with this, cultivates more and more his brilliant virtue, and diffuses
its brightness over the four quarters of the land.

Wilhelm/Baynes: That which is bright rises twice: the image of Fire. Thus the
great man, by perpetuating this brightness, illuminates the four quarters of the
world.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire rising in two tongues of brilliant flame.
The Superior Man, by perpetuating the brilliance of the ancients, illuminates
every quarter of the earth. [In other words, we should make ourselves as
completely dependent on the principle of righteousness as natural objects are
dependent upon nature; in this way, we are sure to be successful.]

Liu: Doubled brightness symbolizes Fire. A great man perpetuates the light and
illuminates the four corners of the universe.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness doubled arousing Radiance. Great People use
consecutive brightening to illuminate tending- towards the four sides.

Cleary (1): Light has dual function. Thus do great people illumine the four
quarters with continuing light. [The sun goes in at night and comes out in the
daytime; this pattern represents inner illumination and outer illumination, one
light having dual function...Outer illumination has to be based on inner
illumination... Illumination must reach inside and outside, so that both are
illumined and both are correct.]

Cleary (2): Illumination doubled makes fire. Great people illumine the four
quarters with continuing illumination.

Wu: Brightness doubled makes Allegiance. Thus the great man carries on the
brightness to shine the four corners of the earth.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Clarity means clinging attachment. The sun and moon
have their roots in heaven, and all the growing things have their roots in the
earth. The double brightness of the two trigrams is rooted in correctness, and all
under heaven are thereby transformed. The magnetic second line is central and
correct, indicating a free and successful course. Nourishing a passive docility will
lead to good fortune.

Legge: Clarity is the trigram of fire and light, and the sun is the source of both
of these. Its attribute is brightness, and by a natural metaphor: intelligence. But
30 -- Clarity -- 30

this trigram also means inhering or in adhering to -- being attached to. In the
hexagram we have a double brightness -- a phrase which denotes the ruler. If we
take the two central lines as emblematic of the situation, we have the magnetic
dwelling with the dynamic above and below -- a condition requiring a docile
humility and strict adherence to what is correct. Ch'eng-tzu says: "The nature of
the ox is docile, and that of the cow is much more so. The subject of the
hexagram adhering closely to what is correct must be able to act in obedience to
it, as docile as a cow, and then there will be good fortune."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Willed persistence gets results. Be receptive to your inner light, and
reflect it in your life.

The Superior Man cultivates his capacity to manifest his comprehension of the
Work in his everyday choices.

Light is a symbol of both normal consciousness and super- consciousness.
Probably every religion in the world uses it in the latter sense -- from the "Let
there be light" in the first chapter of Genesis, to The Lord of Light (Ahura
Mazda), the supreme being of Zoroastrianism. The Tibetan Book of the
Dead speaks of the "clear white light" which is the first thing encountered after
bodily death -- a phenomenon reported as the experiential perception of those
who have had near-death experiences. Light means Truth, it means Reality, and
the "double brightness" of this hexagram tells us that Clarity is manifested both
above and below.

Meditation on light is one of the most important exercises in the various
schools of Tibetan Yoga. The more these psychic and spiritual powers can
be achieved during life, the stronger is the ability to penetrate and
overcome the bardo.
D. I. Lauf, Secret Doctrines Of The Tibetan Book Of The
Dead

The Confucian commentary gives the examples of the sun and moon in the
heavens, and of growing things on the earth as emblems of Clarity. Sun and
moon are certainly luminous, but growing things are not, and when we meditate
on the reason for this strange juxtaposition we are led to the idea of the Self and
the ego. The Self is the sun, the source of illumination which causes the ego to
grow. Sun is to growing things as Self is to ego. This idea is repeated in the
relationship between the sun and the moon -- the moon is not self-luminous, it
can only reflect the light of the sun. Therefore, sun is to moon as Self is to ego.

The idea is that despite our illusions to the contrary, all of our power
originates somewhere else. When we allow the power to work through us without
interference, we become "docile" like the cow in the judgment. Clarity,
therefore, is attained through docility -- the ability to subdue and restrain the
30 -- Clarity -- 30

autonomous components of the psyche, which left to their own devices would
prefer to go around pontificating their brilliant illusions rather than quietly
reflecting the truth. It is not easy to reflect the truth, and the superior man is
counseled to constantly perfect his capacity to do so. It is only when Self and ego
come together in a fusion reaction that the energy released attains the true
"double brightness" imaged in the hexagram. The identical idea is found in the
Kabbalah:

Said Rabbi Simeon: "When the Holy One arrays himself, it is in the
ornaments from both the celestial and terrestrial worlds; from the
former with that heavenly light on high that no human being can
approach unto; from the latter with the souls of the righteous who the
more they approximate themselves to this divine light the more receptive
and filled with it do they become, so that through them it expands in all
directions and the world like a cistern or ocean is filled with it."
The Zohar

Wilhelm mentions that the hexagram "divided within and closed without,
is an image of the meshes of a net in which animals remain snared." This gives us
the image of Clarity as Comprehension -- a net which captures and encloses
insights. To receive the figure without changing lines is often a confirmation of an
idea or action -- it is saying: "You have comprehended," or "Your proposed action
is lucid, intelligent, etc."
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows one ready to move with confused steps.
But he treads at the same time reverently, and there will be no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The footprints run crisscross. If one is seriously intent, no
blame. [It is precisely at the beginning that serious concentration is important,
because the beginning holds the seed of all that is to follow.]

Blofeld: Approaching with reverent steps, he pays them his respects -- no error!
[This suggests a rather delicate situation in which we should avoid any
appearance of lacking respect for others.]

Liu: The footsteps are confused. If one is cautious, no blame. [Everyone should
watch his steps so that he doesn’t injure his feet.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Treading, polishing therefore. Respecting it. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Treading counter-wise; respect it; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): The steps are awry. If you are heedful of this, there will be no fault.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

Wu: The subject is treading cautiously. With due respect, he will be blameless.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The reverent attention directed to his confused steps is the
way by which error is avoided. Wilhelm/Baynes: Seriousness when footprints
run crisscross serves in avoiding blame. Blofeld: He walks reverently expressly
to avoid blame. Ritsema/Karcher: Using casting-out fault indeed. Cleary
(2): Be heedful when the steps are awry, to avoid fault. Wu: Having due respect
in cautious treading is to avoid being blamed.

Legge: Line one is dynamic at the bottom of the trigram of fire, the nature of
which is to ascend. He therefore will move upwards, but is in danger of doing so
coarsely and vehemently. However, since the lowest line has hardly entered into
the action of the hexagram, this makes him reverently careful of his movements
and there is no error.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is initially confused amid the bustle of life. He will
avoid error by careful attention to the central issue at stake.

Wing: When you first begin on your new path, you are bombarded by
impressions. Keep your goal in mind constantly and you can avoid confusion.
Furthermore, do not forget your position as a beginner, somewhat outside the
situation.

Editor: Wilhelm's commentary says that line one is analogous to the dawn, line
two to noon, and line three to sunset. Here at the beginning of the day, full clarity
has yet to manifest, but serious intent will compensate for your relative ignorance
of the facts at hand.

When one follows the path of individuation, when one lives one's own life,
one must take mistakes into the bargain; life would not be complete
without them. There is no guarantee -- not for a single moment -- that we
will not fall into error or stumble into deadly peril.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. When in the dark, keep the faith: trust the Work and pick your way very
carefully.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject in her place in yellow. There
will be great good fortune.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

Wilhelm/Baynes: Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: Yellow sunlight -- sublime good fortune.

Liu: The yellow light of the sun indicates great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Yellow radiance. Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Yellow net; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary(1): Yellow fire is very auspicious.

Wu: The yellow fire will bring great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Good fortune because she holds the course of the due mean.
Wilhelm/Baynes: One has found the middle way. Blofeld: The good fortune
of being able to keep to a middle path. [This is suggested by the position of the
line, which is central to the lower trigram. The middle path, the golden mean, is
praised by Taoists, Confucians and Buddhists alike. It has always been
regarded by traditionally minded Chinese as the principle upon which conduct
should be based. Extremes of any kind have no place in Chinese philosophy,
which is thus more humanistic than many of the philosophies of India and the
Middle East.] Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring centering tao indeed. Cleary (2):
Attaining the middle way. Wu: Because it is centrally situated.

Legge: Line two is magnetic and occupies the center. Yellow is one of the five
correct colors, and here symbolizes the correct course to which she adheres.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man occupies the central position of reasonableness, which results in
enduring good fortune.

Wing: A reasonable and moderate attitude will bring you the best possible luck.
Remember, indulge in no excess, no extremes of thought or action.

Editor: Yellow is a nearly universal symbol of light and clarity. Both the sun and
gold are yellow, and because it is in the middle of the trigram this line images the
concept of the golden mean. Wilhelm's commentary places this line at midday
when the sun is directly overhead, hence: full illumination. If this is the only
changing line, the new hexagram becomes number fourteen, Wealth
(Possession in Great Measure), suggesting the richness of clear insight.

I, wisdom, am mistress of discretion, the inventor of lucidity of thought.

30 -- Clarity -- 30

Good advice and sound judgment belong to me, Perception to me,
strength to me.
Proverbs 8: 12

A. The image suggests a position of balance and lucidity. Full
comprehension is implied.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject in a position like that of the
declining sun. Instead of playing on his instrument of earthenware, and singing
to it, he utters the groans of an old man of eighty. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In the light of the setting sun, men either beat the pot and
sing or loudly bewail the approach of old age. Misfortune.

Blofeld: In the light of the setting sun, young men do not beat upon their
cooking pots or sing; the old sigh piteously -- misfortune!

Liu: Under the light of the setting sun, one sings without beating the pot,
bemoaning one's old age. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sun going-down's radiance. Not drumbeating a jar
and-also singing. By-consequence great old-age's lamenting. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The net of the sun's decline; not drumming the earthenware jar
and yet singing, then the sighing of the great mourning kerchief; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The afternoon light; unless you drum on a jug and sing, there will
be the lament of old age, which is unfortunate.

Cleary (2): In the fire of the afternoon sun, you either drum on a jug and sing,
or lament as in old age. This bodes ill. [When you use insight too much without
concentration to balance it, sometimes you will be extremely joyful, drumming
and singing, and sometimes you will be extremely anxious, lamenting as in old
age. Sadness and joy disturb the song of your heart; intellectual insight cannot
sustain itself – backsliding and loss are inevitable.]

Wu: The sun is passing the meridian. If he does not play his earthen
instrument and sing, but sighs like an old man of eighty years, there will be
foreboding. [The passing of the meridian is like the passing of the prime time in
life. If one does not make the best of his life now, it will be gone forever.]
30 -- Clarity -- 30
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A position like that of the setting sun -- how can it continue
long? Wilhelm/Baynes: How can one wish to hold for long the light of the
setting sun? Blofeld: Sunset beauty -- how can it endure for long? [This
passage suggests that our present happiness or success is not destined to
endure; we must prepare for a setback.] Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore
permitting lasting indeed? Cleary (2): Afternoon sun cannot last long. Wu:
How long will the day last?

Legge: Line three is at the top of the lower trigram, whose light is now
exhausted, suggesting a sunset. He should accept his position and resign himself
to the ordinary amusements mentioned, but he groans and mourns instead. His
restless activity interferes with the lowly contentment he should cherish. The
K'ang-hsi editors say that the declining sun is an emblem of "obscuration coming
over the virtue of the mind."

Anthony: Fear and worry over the length of time required to attain recognizable
progress puts us in the wrong balance. If we can nobleheartedly accept that
things will be fulfilled when they will, we secure our fate by making possible that
it can be fulfilled. As long as the ego stands by expectantly, measuring and
weighing our progress, the dark force of doubt operates and the power of good
cannot manifest itself. Obtaining this line reminds us that adversity lasts only for
a time; through it we mould our character.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man reaches his declining years and recalls the transitoriness of life.
Instead of enjoying the ordinary pleasures while they last, he groans in
melancholy.

Wing: The best attitude to cultivate at this time in your life is a general
acceptance of fate. To totally lose yourself in the happiness of the moment is as
bad as to bemoan the passing of time. Such folly of the mind and the emotions
leads to a loss of inner freedom. Misfortune.

Editor: There is apparently more than one way to translate this line, best seen in
the contrast between Cleary’s Taoist and Buddhist versions. One implies that
frivolity is an antidote to depression, the other that both positions are extreme.
Emphasized in all translations is the contrast between joy and sorrow, singing
and groaning, youth and old age. The setting sun symbolizes the decline of
awareness, the "darkening of the light," the advance of illusion. That is: to either
mindlessly sing or to bewail one's fate is to be deluded -- one has forgotten one's
Source. Frivolity and despair are polarized attitudes, and the line tells us that
clarity wanes whenever one takes an extreme position. In another context, the
setting sun suggests the inevitability of death. Those who believe that death is
final usually respond in either of the two ways shown, and thus miss the mark.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

There is also a suggestion of the futility of trying to hold onto something that is by
nature transitory. Note the similarity between this line and line three of
Hexagram #61, Inner Truth: “He finds a comrade. Now he beats the drum,
now he stops. Now he sobs, now he sings.” Wing’s paraphrase is probably the
best.

No soul, not even our own, enters into the body completely. Soul always
remains united by its higher part to the intelligible realm. But if the part
that is in the realm of sense dominates, or rather becomes dominated and
disturbed, it keeps us unaware of what the higher part of the soul
contemplates.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. An image of gross illusion. Clarity is lost when perception is polarized.

B. Nothing lasts here below, but that's only half the story -- the least
interesting half.

C. “Gather your rosebuds while ye may.”
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows the manner of its subject's coming. How
abrupt it is, as with fire, with death, to be rejected by all!

Wilhelm/Baynes: Its coming is sudden; it flames up, dies down, is thrown
away.

Blofeld: How sudden its coming! Then with flamelike swiftness it is dead and
cast away. [Apparently we may expect some unlooked for good fortune, but of a
kind that will have passed away before we have had time to enjoy it.]

Liu: It comes abruptly; it burns up, dies, and is cast aside.

Ritsema/Karcher: Assailing thus, its coming thus. Burning thus. Dying thus.
Thrown-out thus.

Shaughnessy: As if going out, as if coming, as if confused, as if dying, as if
dismissing.

Cleary (1): The coming forth is abrupt, burning, dying, abandoned.

Wu: So abruptly it comes, like burning, like dying, like being abandoned. [The
symbolic associations paint a scene of hell. Some scholars consider this
judgment to be the most vicious of the 384 judgments of the lines in the Yi
Jing.]
30 -- Clarity -- 30
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: None can bear with him. Wilhelm/Baynes: Yet in itself it
has nothing that would cause it to be accepted. Blofeld: Its coming was sudden
and there was no place for it. Ritsema/Karcher: Without a place to tolerate
indeed. Cleary (2): There is no accommodation. [Why wait until burning out
that this is not the way to a good end?] Wu: Because it is not accommodated.

Legge: Line four's dynamic activity in a magnetic place makes him appear in this
unseemly manner -- a disaster to himself.

Anthony: We know that perseverance over a period of time is necessary to
accomplish our goals; nevertheless, or inferiors complain of how long it takes.
This causes us to doubt ourself, the great-man potential in others and the
Creative. We need to rid ourselves of our complaining inferiors, thereby
disconnect our inner gaze. In this way we overcome the ego and hold to clarity.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man forges upward too abruptly in his restlessness. Others cannot bear
his unseemly manner, and he consumes himself like the fire.

Wing: Your display of overly enthusiastic energies and endeavors will exhaust
you. Nothing will come of it all.

Editor: This is often an image of myopic enthusiasm -- perhaps a "brilliant idea”
that will come to nothing because it does not harmonize with a larger reality.
Although sometimes a warning about intemperate responses, at its most neutral
the line can refer to a temporary situation which will end as soon as it begins.
Despite Wu’s commentary about this being the most “vicious” line in the Book
of Changes, it is more often an image of an inconsequential manifestation of
some sort. [Added note 5/24/08: I concur with Wu. See paraphrase C.]

The second stage, that of emotional excitement or elation – when the
individual is carried away by an excessive enthusiasm and cherishes the
illusion of having arrived at a permanent attainment – calls for a gentle
warning that his blessed state is, of necessity, but temporary and he
should be given a description of the vicissitudes of the way ahead of him.
R. Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

A. A flash in the pan -- a sudden but temporary burst of energy.

B. “So much for that idea!"

C. “Hell also is a place to live.”
30 -- Clarity -- 30
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject as one with tears flowing in
torrents, and groaning in sorrow. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting. Good fortune.

Blofeld: His tears streamed forth as though to extinguish his piteous sighs --
good fortune! [Bitter regret serves us in good stead.]

Liu: A flood of tears, sighing, and sadness. Good fortune. [There may be
suffering and mourning, but good fortune hides in misfortune.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Issuing-forth tears like gushing. Sadness like lamenting.
Significant.

Shaughnessy: Going out with tears as if streaming and grief as if sighing;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Weeping and lamenting. Good fortune. [This is clearly knowing one
is not illumined.]

Wu: With tears flowing profusely, he sighs with sorrow. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to her occupying the place of the ruler.
Wilhelm/Baynes: [She] clings to king and prince. Blofeld: This good fortune
stems from the rulers. [For purposes of divination, we may take it that "rulers"
means anyone with authority over us.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Radiance: the
kingly prince indeed. Cleary (2): The good fortune of the fifth yin is cleaving to
rulers. [This represents concentration in balance, which can bring forth genuine
insight; therefore progress is certain. “Weeping and lamenting” refers to
abstention from complacency and presumption; this is always characteristic of
the study of sages.] Wu: The auspiciousness is due to his adherence to the king.
[When he is humble enough to pledge allegiance to the higher authority, he will
be rewarded with good fortune.]

Legge: Line five is central in the place of honor, but she is magnetic, as is her
correlate in line two. Her position between the dynamic four and six fills her with
anxiety and apprehension -- shown by her weeping and groaning. But such
demonstrations are proof of her inward adherence to humility
and correctness, so there will be good fortune.

Anthony: We attain a clear view when, in going through difficulties, we
acknowledge that adversity is necessary for growth. This change of heart
30 -- Clarity -- 30

displaces vain considerations that accompany change, such as dread at growing
older, being unattractive, or having to go through embarrassing decreases of ego.
We overcome vanity when we realize that the ego, despite its bravado, has
nothing to do with our success, and is an obstruction to progress.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man reaches the zenith of life. After experiencing certain
disappointments, he recognizes the vanity of human behavior. If he modifies his
value system and mood, good fortune will eventually be realized.

Wing: A true change of heart is occurring. Such dramatic change is sometimes
accompanied by a deep grief. Yet with this grief comes good fortune because the
change will bring better times for all concerned.

Editor: If this is the only moving line, the hexagram is changed to number
thirteen, Union of Forces, the corresponding line of which reads: "The
representative of the Union of Forces first wails and cries out, and then
laughs..." The present position thus describes the struggles and pains involved in
growth, and the "union of forces" is the product of this growth. Since this
hexagram refers to clarity and comprehension, the increase could be the creation
of new concepts or ideas. Because this is a magnetic line located between two
dynamic lines there is conveyed the idea of mediating between two extremes.
This mediation is necessarily a balancing act, as the stress of the position
indicates.

Suffering that is not understood is hard to bear, while on the other hand
it is often astounding to see how much a person can endure when he
understands the why and the wherefore. A philosophical or religious
view of the world enables him to do this, and such views prove to be, at
the very least, psychic methods of healing if not of salvation.
Jung -- The Symbolic Life

A. Growing pains are harbingers of integration.

B. The shattering of illusions is never pleasant, yet the pain is a prelude to
something better.

C. Growing pains, but still growing!
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows the king employing his subject in his
punitive expeditions. Achieving admirable merit, he breaks only the chiefs of the
rebels. Where his prisoners were not their associates, he does not punish. There
will be no error.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

Wilhelm/Baynes: The king uses him to march forth and chastise. Then it is
best to kill the leaders and take captive the followers. No blame.

Blofeld: The King went forth to set things to rights and, blessed by heaven with
victory, he destroyed the leader of the rebels; but he did not chastise the rebel
followers -- no error!

Liu: The king goes to fight. Victory. He kills the leader and captures the
followers. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Kinghood availing-of issuing-forth chastising. Possessing
excellence. Severing the head. Catching in-no-way its demons. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The king goes out on campaign; there is the joy of cutting off
heads and bagging the non-masses; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): The king hereby goes on an expedition; there is good luck, and he
crushes the leader. As the captive is not the common followers, there is no blame.

Cleary (2): The king goes on an expedition, has good luck, and overcomes the
leader, taking captives, but not because they are repugnant. No fault.

Wu: The king leads his expedition, commends those who kill the defiant
chieftains, and captures those who are against his people. There will be no blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The object is to bring the regions to a correct state.
Wilhelm/Baynes: In order to bring the country under discipline. Blofeld: To
rectify the affairs of the various states comprising his realm. [This passage
implies that we may be compelled to resort to forceful measures but that we
should avoid chastising those who have been led to do harm by others.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Using correcting the fiefdoms indeed. Cleary (2): To bring
correct order to the country. Wu: He does what is good for the country.

Legge: Line six. dynamic and at the top of the figure, has the intelligence
denoted by its trigrams in the highest degree, as well as his own proper vigor.
Because of this his achievements are great, and since his generous consideration
is equally conspicuous he falls into no error.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is employed by the ruler to conduct punitive expeditions. He kills
the ringleaders of the enemy but spares the followers. He roots out the bad but
tolerates the relatively harmless. He avoids excessive punishments.
30 -- Clarity -- 30

Wing: It is up to you to penetrate to the source of trouble in the situation and
eradicate it. Act with moderation however, in dealing with others who may have
been duped into wrong thinking. Once the major problem is out of the way, order
will reign. (Note: This line may refer to a bad habit or character weakness.)

Editor: The image here is one of analysis -- Clarity as a function of logic. The
idea is to sort out all the elements of the situation, remove the source of error but
retain the good elements. The peak of Clarity is reached when one takes action
based upon lucid differentiation between the defective (or dangerous) and the
useful.

If, as administrators of His kingdom, you have not governed justly nor
observed the law, nor behaved as God would have you behave, He will
fall on you swiftly and terribly. Ruthless judgment is reserved for the
high and mighty; the lowly will be compassionately pardoned.
Wisdom 6: 4-7

A. One differentiates between harmful and benign elements within the
situation.

B. “Don't throw out the baby with the bath water."

C. “Accent the positive, eliminate the negative.”

# 31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-ONE --
INITIATIVE (INFLUENCE)

Other titles: Influence, Wooing, Attraction, Sensation, Stimulation,
Conjoining, Feelings, Sensitivity, Sensing, Affection, Influencing to Action,
Tension, Seeking Union, Persuasion, Courting Response, Importuning

Judgment

Legge: Upon fulfillment of the conditions implied in Initiative, there will be
free course and success. Advantage depends upon firm correctness, as in
marrying a young lady. Good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Influence. Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a
maiden to wife brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Attraction. Success! Righteous persistence brings reward. Taking a
wife will result in good fortune.

Liu: Attraction. Success. To continue is of benefit. To marry a girl is good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining, Growing. Harvesting Trial. Grasping
womanhood significant. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the
influence that separated parts of an intrinsic whole have on each other. It
emphasizes that bringing these parts into contact is the adequate way to handle
the situation...]

Shaughnessy: Feelings: Receipt; beneficial to determine; to take to wife a
woman is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Sensitivity is developmental. It is beneficial to be correct. Marriage
brings good fortune.

Cleary (2): Sensing gets through, beneficial if correct. Marriage is auspicious.

Wu: Affection indicates pervasion and advantage to be persevering. There will
be good fortune to marry a young woman.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

The Image

Legge: The image of a marsh over a mountain forms Initiative. The superior
man frees his mind of preoccupation so that he is open to the influence of others.
[Lit: "Thus the superior man receives people by virtue of emptiness."]

Wilhelm/Baynes: A lake on the mountain: the image of Influence. Thus the
superior man encourages people to approach him by his willingness to receive
them.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a lake situated upon a mountain. In dealing
with men, the Superior Man shows himself to be entirely void of selfishness.

Liu: The lake on top of the mountain symbolizes Attraction. With a humble
manner the superior man receives people.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above mountain possessing marsh. Conjoining. A chun
tzu uses emptiness to acquiesce people.

Cleary (1): There is a lake on a mountain. Thus does the superior person accept
people with openness.

Cleary (2): There is a lake atop a mountain – Sensing. Developed people
accept others with openness.

Wu: There is a marsh in the mountain; this is Affection. Thus the jun zi
receives people with humility.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Initiative is here used in the sense of mutually influencing.
The magnetic trigram is above and the dynamic trigram is below -- their two
influences move, respond and unite with each other. The male is placed below the
female -- his repression is her satisfaction and brings fulfillment. Advantage
depends upon firm correctness, as in the marrying of a young lady. Heaven and
earth stimulate each other and all things attain birth. The sages stimulate the
minds of men and harmony is born. If we examine the pattern of these
influences, the nature of heaven and earth is revealed.

Legge: The lines of the hexagram all deal with moving or influencing to
movement, and the figure is an essay on the different ways of creating an
influence, and the results engendered thereby. The lower trigram of the youngest
son supports the upper trigram of the youngest daughter in happy union. This is
correct because the lower trigram (here yang) should always take the initiative.
No influence is so powerful and constant as that between husband and wife, and
where they are both young, it is especially active. Therefore, mutual influence,
correct in itself, and for correct ends is sure to be effective.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Initiative succeeds only when it originates from the Self.

The Superior Man clears his mind and remains receptive to the will of the Self.

Wilhelm's translation of the name of this hexagram is Influence, but I
have chosen Initiative to emphasize the idea of the proper source of the
influence implied in the symbolism. Webster's Third New International
Dictionary defines initiative as follows:

Initiative 1: an introductory step or movement: an act designed to
originate or set on foot, as a process or train of events. Often used in the
phrase: on one's own initiative, as in: "Don't blame me, he acted on his
own initiative."

The Judgment states that the situation can be furthered only by the firm
correctness associated with the proper contracting of a marriage. We already
know that the symbolism of marriage refers to a union of opposites within the
psyche. To understand what is meant by the proper contracting of a marriage, we
need only look at hexagram number fifty-four, Propriety (The Marrying
Maiden), to see the improper way to do it -- that is, when the woman takes the
initiative.

Far from being a sexist idea, the symbolism reveals a profound archetypal
truth. The polarity of forces in the psyche shows the ego as magnetic to the
dynamic Self. That is, the conscious ego-complex in any psyche, male or female,
is feminine, or magnetic in relation to the Self, which is masculine, or dynamic.
In the I Ching the Self is symbolized by heaven, and the ego is symbolized by
earth. This primordial relationship between the two qualities is found in many
symbol systems. Here's the Kabbalistic version:

This clearly indicates the function of polarity that prevails between the
planes of form and the planes of force; the planes of form being the
female aspect, polarized and made fertile by the influences of the planes
of force.
D. Fortune -- The Mystical Qabalah

The Hermetic tradition describes it this way:

There is this dual aspect in the mind of every person. The "I" [Self]
represents the Masculine Principle of Mental Gender -- the "Me" [ego]
represents the Female Principle.
The Kybalion
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

In the contracting of a marriage between heaven and earth (uniting the
polarities within the divided psyche), the ego must learn, usually through great
suffering, that its correct role is a magnetic one in relation to that of the Self. The
Work cannot progress until this lesson has been learned and accepted
completely. As long as the ego insists on taking dynamic initiative “as usual" in
the illusory world of appearances, the results can only be the kind of objective
world we inhabit -- one of chaos and strife. The lesson of this hexagram then, is
the realization that the only correct source of power lies with the Self, and that
the ego must yield to that source as a bride to her bridegroom. (Unfortunately,
the contemporary relationship between the sexes has become so confused that
this metaphor is seldom effective in conveying the profound truth it represents.)

The Self (the Causal Body of Theosophy) dwells beyond the restrictions of
spacetime and is pre-eminently suited for directing the Work, since it can "see
ahead” so to speak, and it knows the effects of all of the available choices. The
ego, on the other hand, dwells in spacetime and is able to take action: by its
choices it makes or breaks the Work. The ideal reciprocity between ego and Self
is a simple and logical division of labor -- the Self can see ahead but cannot take
direct action, and the ego can take direct action but cannot see ahead. For the
ego to act without direction from the Self is to grope blindly in the dark -- and the
Work clearly cannot progress under such circumstances. The superior man
therefore, "clears his mind and remains receptive to the will of the Self.”
Obviously, it takes time to learn how to do this properly; in its initial stages, that's
what the Work is all about.

The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity,
environment, etc., and manifest very little freedom. They are swayed by
the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by
their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy
of the name.
The Kybalion

The second and third sentences in the Confucian commentary elicit the
sexual symbolism in this hexagram quite clearly: "The [female] trigram is above
and the [male] trigram is below -- their two influences move, respond and unite
with each other. The male is placed below the female -- his repression is her
satisfaction and brings fulfillment.” Blofeld comments on this in a footnote:

I doubt if this should be regarded as shedding light upon the ancient
Chinese concept of the most acceptable position for intercourse; it is more
likely to mean that the girl is able to depend upon the man as a plant
depends upon the earth for its nourishment.

Symbolism works on many levels, and Blofeld's aborted insight does apply
to some of them. It is an established fact that the sentences in question
accurately describe tantric sexual techniques practiced in the Orient for
millennia. To understand the principles of the Work we must be able to see the
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

"obvious" as symbolic of an abstraction -- and vice- versa. Sexual polarity is a
very tricky and volatile symbol because we are predisposed to confine it to its
most literal meaning. The hardest part of symbolic interpretation is to know
where in the continuum a specific symbol belongs in any given situation.

Without changing lines this hexagram suggests that you examine your
impulses and motivations to act and see if they are truly in accordance with the
goals of the Work. The figure can sometimes take on the meaning of
importuning: "to press or urge with frequent or unreasonable requests or
troublesome persistence.” In other words, you might be importuning the oracle
for answers which it is of no mind to give you. It is also significant to note that
every line has a more or less negative connotation. These are all very strong
warnings to the ego to control its compulsive need to take the Initiative, to
influence the situation. Calm down -- reality is not what it appears to be. Please
allow the Self to direct the Work.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare the concepts in this hexagram with hexagram number fifty-four,
Propriety; number fifty-three, Gradual Progress; and number eleven,
Harmony. How do they all deal with the symbol of marriage as an aspect of the
Work? Compare the first three lines with hexagram number 52, Keeping Still.

Initiative is the first hexagram of Part II of the I Ching. Why do you
suppose the book was divided into two unequal sections? Why did the division
appear between the thirtieth and thirty-first hexagrams? (An even division would
be between the thirty-second and thirty-third.)

The (I Ching) was originally divided into two books. (Appendix VI)
considers the first of these as dealing with the world of nature, and the
second as dealing with that of man.

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows one moving her great toes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The influence shows itself in the big toe.

Blofeld: Sensation in the toe.

Liu: Stimulation in the big toe. [If you get this line you will plan an
undertaking, but if it is planned hastily, it will be difficult to carry out.]
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining one's big toes.

Shaughnessy: Feeling his big toe.

Cleary (1): Sensing in the big toe is inauspicious. [The big toe can move but not
walk; to feel something one can not carry out is not right sensing. This is
sensitivity that stirs the human mentality.]

Cleary (2): Sensing in the big toe.

Wu: He moves his big toes.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her mind is set on what is beyond herself. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The will is directed outward. Blofeld: This implies that the will is
fastened upon external matters. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose located outside
indeed. Cleary (2): The aspiration is outside. Wu: His affection is outward.

Legge: The first line is magnetic at the commencement of the figure. Although
the fourth line is a proper correlate, his influence will be ineffective. However
much she moves her toes, that won't enable her to walk. What is "beyond
herself" is represented by the fourth line. There is the desire to influence but no
strength and/or ability to do so.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, something is beginning to happen which is not yet apparent to
everyone.

Wing: There is something in the air. Perhaps it's the beginning of a compelling
attraction or an idea just coming to light. Whatever it is, it is of little significance,
since a great deal more must be done to make it a reality.

Editor: Although the image is simple, the concept behind it is not. Wilhelm's
commentary suggests the idea of a hidden influence, a latent force within the
situation, which has not yet become apparent. This energy is focused on what is
beyond itself -- i.e., it wants to become manifest, but as yet is not powerful
enough to do so. (There is a suggestion of impatience to take action.) At its most
neutral, the line can image a concern with something distant in time or space --
even an abstract idea. Legge's Confucian commentary is a good paraphrase.

In times of stress, physical or mental, he might astonish his friends and
even himself by the undisciplined and primitive reactions that suddenly
usurp the attitudes of the well-drilled persona. Such reactions do not
come from the conscious part of the psyche; they arise from the
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

nonpersonal part and reveal not the conscious character but the stage of
development that the nonpersonal psyche has reached.

B. An image of a restless ego -- a mind seething with "great plans,"
schemes or intentions.

C. "Don't cross your bridges until you come to them."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows one moving the calves of her legs.
There will be evil. If she abides quietly in her place, there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.
Misfortune. Tarrying brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Sensation in the legs -- misfortune! [I.e. Misfortune if we yield to the
urge to exercise our legs by going somewhere else.] Good fortune comes to those
who do not venture forth.

Liu: Stimulation in the calves of the legs. Misfortune. Stillness invites good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining one's calves. Pitfall. Residing significant.

Shaughnessy: Feeling his calf; inauspicious; to dwell is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Sensing in the calf is inauspicious. Biding is auspicious.

Cleary (2): Sensing in the calf bodes ill. To stay put bodes well.

Wu: He moves his calves. It will be foreboding. Should he stay, there will be good
fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If she abides quietly in her place and complies with the
circumstances of her condition there will be no injury. Wilhelm/Baynes: Even
though misfortune threatens, tarrying brings good fortune. One does not come to
harm through devotion. Blofeld: If we gladly accord with others, we shall come
to no harm. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding, not harming indeed. Cleary (2):
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

Because obedience does no harm. Wu: His rash move will be foreboding.
Patience will turn into good fortune, as observance will keep out humiliation.

Legge: The calves cannot move of themselves -- they follow the moving of the
feet. She is too anxious to move. However, she is magnetic and central, so if she
abides quietly in her place until she is acted upon from above, there will be good
fortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The influence of the man increases, yet it is not obvious. He is eager to act
but should wait for more favorable circumstances.

Wing: You may feel compelled to move, to take some kind of action, yet you
really don't know what you're doing. It's a little like sleepwalking. Avoid action
until you wake up to what's going on. Otherwise there is some danger of getting
into trouble.

Editor: This image of the calves of the legs might be rendered in Western idiom
as "knee-jerk responses." The meaning is analogous, if not identical.

During the years of our indiscretion, while we are driven hither and
thither by our various likes and dislikes, we serve many Masters, who
often prove veritable tyrants to us, but when we have had enough of
them, we find that there is a Master of a different stamp, who lives not by
our passions and desires, but rather by their suppression and subdual.
E. Gewurz -- The Hidden Treasures of the Ancient Qabalah

A. Control your knee-jerk responses. Do not pursue this train of thought,
line of speculation, hypothesis, etc. Wait for inspiration from the Self.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows one moving his thighs, and keeping close
hold of those whom he follows. Going forward in this way will cause regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The influence shows itself in the thighs. Holds to that which
follows it. To continue is humiliating.

Blofeld: Sensation in the thighs. He cleaves so closely to his wife (handmaiden,
etc.) that for him to continue in this manner would be shameful.

Liu: Stimulation in the thighs. If he insists on following, he will be humiliated.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining one's thighs. Holding-on-to one's following.
Going abashed.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

Shaughnessy: Feeling his calf: thigh: holding to his follower; distress.

Cleary (1): Sensing in the thighs; when persistence turns to indulgence, to go on
is shameful.

Cleary (2): Sensing in the thighs, when clinging is following, to go on brings
shame.

Wu: He moves his thighs and stays close to those he follows. He will regret
if he keeps going forward.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: "He moves his thighs" -- he still doesn't want to rest in his
place. His will is set on following others -- what he holds in his grasp is low.
Wilhelm/Baynes: For he cannot keep still. When the will is directed to things
that one's followers hold to, this is very base. Blofeld: Sensation in the thighs
also denotes restlessness; while being guided by the will of a wife (or
subordinate) involves clinging to what is inferior. Ritsema/Karcher: Truly
not abiding indeed. Purpose located-in following people. A place to hold-on-to
the below indeed. Cleary (2): Is also not staying put; the aim is in following
others; what is clung to is low. Wu: Like his predecessors, he does not want to
stay put either. His desire to follow people shows whatever he holds is low.

Legge: The attempt to move the thighs is inauspicious. The dynamic third line,
in a dynamic place, wants to run after line four, which is said here to be the seat
of the mind. He exercises his influence with an inferior purpose. "What he holds
in his grasp is low" is understood to refer to the magnetic first and second lines.
"Following" leads the mind to the lines above. "Low" is understood in the sense
of "mean."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A person should refrain from running after those he would like to influence,
yielding to the whims of his master, and acquiescing to the moods of his own
heart. Personal inhibition should constitute the basis for the enjoyment of
granted freedom.

Wing: You must gain control of yourself. Don't run this way and that on impulse
in an attempt to influence others or indulge in your many whims. You will
ultimately be humiliated by such unconsidered actions. Set up a few inhibitions
for yourself and operate within these limitations while you develop some self-
control.

Editor: Mr. Legge, a proper Victorian, did not bring out the earthy imagery of
this line to its fullest. If we were to receive this image in a dream it might take the
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

blatantly sexual form of the pelvic thrusting associated with male dogs. When
seen in this way the idea behind this line becomes clear.

Hence it is that in men the privy member is disobedient and self-willed,
like a creature that will not listen to reason, and because of frenzied
appetite bent upon carrying all before it. In women again, for the same
reason, what is called the matrix or womb, a living creature within them
with a desire for childbearing, if it be left unfruitful beyond the due
season, is vexed and aggrieved, and wandering throughout the body and
blocking the channels of the breath, by forbidding respiration brings the
sufferer to extreme distress and causes all manner of disorders; until at
last the Eros of the one and the Desire of the other bring the pair together,
pluck as it were the fruit from the tree and sow the plowland of the womb
with living creatures still unformed and too small to be seen.
Plato -- The Timaeus

A. The image suggests a mindless and compulsive urge to influence the
situation.

B. You allow yourself to be influenced by base emotions.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows that firm correctness which will lead to
good fortune, and prevent all occasion for repentance. If its subject be unsettled
in his movements, only his friends will follow his purposes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. If a
man is agitated in mind, and his thoughts go hither and thither, only those
friends on whom he fixes his conscious thoughts will follow.

Blofeld: Righteous persistence brings good fortune and regret vanishes; but
only friends and immediate followers will waste their thoughts on one who
dithers irresolutely to and fro.

Liu: To carry on reaps good fortune; remorse disappears. If his mind is not quiet
and his thoughts go back and forth, only his friends will follow his ideas.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial significant, repenting extinguished. Wavering,
wavering: going, coming. Partnering adheres-to simply pondering.

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious; regret is gone. So undecided going
and coming, a friend follows you in thought.

Cleary (1): Rectitude brings good fortune, and regret disappears. Coming and
going with an unsettled mind: companions follow your thoughts. [Thoughts that
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

“come along with companions” obscure the mind of Tao by the human
mentality.]

Cleary (2): Correctness brings good fortune, and regret disappears. Coming and
going ceaselessly, companions follow your thoughts.

Wu: From perseverance will come auspiciousness. Regret will fade away. His
mind vacillates, but his friends will be able to follow his thoughts.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There has not yet been any harm from a selfish wish to
influence, yet his power to influence is neither brilliant nor great. Wilhelm/
Baynes: In this way one does not stir up anything injurious. Thoughts going
hither and thither in agitation: by this one shows that one has as yet no clear
light. Blofeld: Persistence rewarded and the vanishing of regret both result
from our not having incited anyone to evildoing, but this irresolute conduct
scarcely indicates clarity of mind on our part. [This suggests the rather negative
good fortune of having a clear conscience; apparently we have little reason for
self- congratulation, since our rather spineless conduct alienates everyone who
is not bound to us by ties of blood or friendship.] Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet
influencing harming indeed. Not-yet the shining great indeed. Cleary (2): One
has not yet sensed danger. One is not yet great. Wu: He has not done anything
brilliant.

From the Great Treatise -- It is said in the I Ching: "Full of anxious
thoughts you go and come; only friends will follow you and think with you."
The Master said: "In all the processes taking place under heaven, what is there
of thinking? What is there of anxious scheming? They all come to the same
successful issue, though by different paths. There is one result, though there
might be a hundred anxious schemes. What is there of thinking? What is there
of anxious scheming?”

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but in a magnetic and receptive place. It is the
seat of the mind, and its subject is therefore warned to be firm and correct in
order to get a good issue. If he is wavering and uncertain, his influence won't
extend beyond his circle of friends.

Wilhelm/Baynes: This is a strong line in a weak place, hence it has a twofold
possibility. It can remain firm and, resisting the temptation to use special
influence, quietly make itself felt as one of the rulers of the hexagram, by virtue of
its character; in this case it does not stimulate anything injurious, since it is in
harmony with the right. Or it can instead yield to the influence of the six at the
beginning, to which it is related. Thereby it limits its influence; everything is
shifted onto the conscious plane, and the inner light darkens.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: No harm has yet been incurred from a selfish wish to influence. But neither
is the man's power of any great consequence. He is too indecisive and unsure of
himself to move anyone beyond his own circle of friends.

Wing: The desire to influence a specific person or situation is now enhanced. Do
not become calculating or manipulative in your efforts. Instead, take a unilateral
approach by displaying the strength of your convictions in all that you do. By
remaining consistent in all matters you will achieve your goal.

Editor: The Confucian commentary from the Great Treatise hints at the
subtle truth behind this line. When the ego has attained true tranquility, all
initiative comes directly from the Self. If the ego is "unsettled in its movements,"
only its "friends" (analogous complexes within the psyche) will respond.
Sometimes the message here is to have the discipline not to meddle with a
natural process.

As long as the heart has not attained absolute tranquility, it cannot move
itself ... If, when stimulated by external things, one moves, it is the
impulse of the being. If, when not stimulated by external things, one
moves, it is the movement of heaven ... When no idea arises, the right
ideas come ... When things are quiet and one is quite firm, and the
release of heaven suddenly moves, is this not a movement without
purpose? Action through non-action has just this meaning.
The Secret of the Golden Flower

A. Restlessness prevents unity -- calm down and unify your thinking or
focus your intent.

B. Let it be -- allow the situation to unfold.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows one moving the flesh along the spine above
the heart. There will be no occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The influence shows itself in the back of the neck. No
remorse.

Blofeld: Sensation in the fleshy covering of the spinal column -- no regret.

Liu: Stimulation in the middle of the back. No remorse. [Conflict. Perhaps one's
strong opinions ... will create discord ... One can expect difficulty in carrying out
his plans. Only small ventures will succeed.]
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining one's neck. Without repenting.

Shaughnessy: Feeling his (thigh:) spine; there is no regret.

Cleary (1): Sensing in the flesh of the back, there is no regret. [What separates
the mind of Tao from the human (ego) mind is but a hairbreadth; sensing it in
the flesh of the back means it is near the heart ...The mind that is not mind is
called the true mind ... It is open awareness unobscured ... This is sensitivity
preserving the mind of Tao without the human mentality.]

Wu: He moves his upper back muscles. There will be no regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He tries to move the flesh along the spine above the heart --
his aim is trivial. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will is directed to the ramifications.
Blofeld: This betokens inability to impose our will as yet. Ritsema/Karcher:
Purpose, the tips indeed. [Tips:, MO: growing ends, outermost twigs; last,
most distant.] Cleary (2): The aim is concluded. Wu: His affection is at the top.

Legge: The symbolism of line five refers to a part of the body behind the heart,
and is supposed to indicate an ineffective influence. The triviality of the aim
explains the ineffectiveness of the movement, but since it is free from selfish
motivations it is nothing to be repented of.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man's goals are trivial, although free from selfish motives.

Wing: Look within to determine the depth of your influence on external matters.
People with a profound inner resolve can accomplish much. Those with shallow
roots cannot exert significant external influence.

Editor: Despite the "no remorse," this is can be a less than positive line. The
influence here doesn't come from the heart, but from a region near the heart: it
isn't that the motivations are insincere, it's that they miss the mark. "Trivial"
(Legge, Siu) means "of little or no value" -- a fair synonym for "illusion." At a
deeper level, Wilhelm comments: "What takes place in the depths of one's being,
in the unconscious, can neither be called forth nor prevented by the conscious
mind. It is true that if we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot influence
the outside world.” If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram is number
62, Small Powers, with its corresponding line portraying a lack of
understanding of hidden matters. This can sometimes imply things within the
situation which are beyond the ego's immediate comprehension.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

To educate men to a faith they do not understand is certainly a well-
meant undertaking, but one runs the risk of creating an attitude that
believes everything it does not understand.
Jung -- The Symbolic Life

A. Although your motives are sincere, they are not in accordance with
reality. Sincere illusions are still illusions.

B. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." The image suggests
erroneous actions or motivations.

Alternate: Cleary’s Taoist commentary describes “the mind of Tao” able
to manifest autonomously when the ego-mind does not impede it – a very high
and unfortunately rare state of consciousness. Wing’s paraphrase captures the
dual nature of this line quite well.

C. The mind of Tao supersedes ego-mindedness. Or: The Self can manifest
when the ego doesn’t take the Initiative.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows one moving her jaws and tongue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.

Blofeld: Sensation in the jaws and the tongue.

Liu: Stimulation in the jaws and tongue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conjoining one's jawbones, cheeks, tongue.

Shaughnessy: Feeling his cheeks, jowls, and tongue.

Cleary (1): Sensing in the jaws and tongue. [When the mouth moves, the mind
moves. This is sensitivity using the human mentality, utterly lacking the mind of
Tao.]

Wu: He moves his tongue and cheeks.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She only talks with loquacious mouth. Wilhelm/Baynes:
He opens his mouth and chatters. Blofeld: This is a way of saying that we open
wide our mouths and talk too much. Ritsema/Karcher: The spouting mouth
stimulating indeed. Cleary (2): Sensing in the jaws and tongue is speaking a lot.
Wu: He likes chattering.
31 -- Initiative (Influence) -- 31

Legge: Line six is magnetic in a magnetic place at the top of the trigram of
Frivolity. Her influence by means of speech will only be that of garrulous
flattery.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man resorts to superficial ways of influencing others through nothing
but talk. The results are negligible.

Wing: Words are only words. Ideas mean little unexecuted. What are you doing?

Editor: The divided line at the top of the upper trigram is said to symbolize an
open mouth. To talk is to use words, and words are a product of the mental
realm. The image is of empty rhetoric -- perhaps a too-intellectual approach to
the situation at hand. This blather can be inner as well as outer, and the line
sometimes refers to the excesses of reason and logic which can blind us to the
truths of an expanded awareness. Often in the course of the Work we are severely
tested by choices which demand the abandonment of common sense in favor of
faith in the Self to carry us to a realm transcending reason. Such tests are
excruciating, and often we fail them because we cannot let go of our faith in logic,
words and "common sense." Compare with line five of Hexagram 52.

I gradually form the habit of listening inwardly, whenever I want to say
something, to be sure I have authority to say it. Gradually I learn to
keep my mouth shut except when I really have something to say. And I
come to recognize two beings in my self: a personal ego which is often
inclined to chatter, without control, purely for the sake of
communicating and attracting attention to my person -- and in the
background of my consciousness a higher self which restrains my
personal ego, telling it when and what it is to speak or do, and when it is
to remain silent or passive. The important thing is to pay attention and
obey the orders of this higher self. Merely to hear its commands is not
enough; everybody does that!
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

A. An image of rationalization or intellectual drivel. Your idea is without
merit.

32 -- Consistency -- 32
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-TWO --
CONSISTENCY

Other titles: Duration, The Symbol of Constancy, The Long Enduring,
Constant, Persevering, Standing Fast, Continuity, Constancy in the Midst of
Change, Holding Firm, "Get yourself into a fixed routine like the orbiting
planets." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Consistency means successful progress without error through firm
correctness. Movement in any direction is advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Duration. Success. No blame. Perseverance furthers. It
furthers one to have somewhere to go.

Blofeld: The Long Enduring. Success and freedom from error! Righteous
persistence brings reward. It is favorable to have in view some goal or
destination.

Liu: Duration. Success. No blame. It benefits to continue. Going anywhere is
advantageous.

Ritsema/Karcher: Persevering, Growing. Without fault. Harvesting Trial.
Harvesting: possessing directed going. [This hexagram describes your situation
in terms of continuity and endurance. It emphasizes that continuing on and
renewing the way you are following is the adequate way to handle the situation.
To be in accord with the time, you are told to persevere!]

Shaughnessy: Constancy: Receipt; there is no trouble; beneficial to
determine; beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): Constancy is developmental. Impeccable. It is beneficial to be
correct. It is beneficial to have a place to go.

Cleary (2): Constancy comes through without fault, beneficial insofar as it is
correct. It is beneficial to have a place to go.

Wu: Constancy indicates pervasion. There will be no blame. It also indicates
advantage of being persevering and having undertakings.
32 -- Consistency -- 32

The Image

Legge: Thunder over wind -- the image of Consistency. The superior man
stands firm and does not change his method of operation.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder and wind: the image of Duration. Thus the
superior man stands firm and does not change his direction.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder accompanied by wind. The
Superior Man stands so firmly that he cannot be uprooted.

Liu: Thunder and wind symbolize Duration. The superior man stands firm
without changing direction.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder, wind, Persevering. A Chun tzu uses
establishing, not versatility on-all-sides.

Cleary (1): Thunder and wind are perpetual. Thus does the superior person
stand without changing places.

Cleary (2): Thunder and wind are constant; so do developed people stand
without changing place.

Wu: A combination of thunder and wind forms Constancy. Thus the jun zi
establishes himself by not changing his post.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Consistency means long continuance. The dynamic
trigram of Thunder is above, and the magnetic trigram of Wind is below. Docility
and Motive Force are in sympathetic communication because their dynamic and
magnetic lines all correspond. When the motive power is spent it will begin again
-- hence movement in any direction is advantageous. The sun and moon are
consistent in their illumination, and the four sequential seasons are consistent in
their cycles of growth. The sages are consistent in their work and all under
heaven are transformed. When we examine this consistent perseverance the
natural tendencies of heaven and earth are revealed.

Legge: The subject of the hexagram is perseverance in what is right, or in
continuously acting out the law of one's being. It is seen as a sequel to the
previous hexagram, Initiative. As that figure deals with the correct relations
between husband and wife, so this figure treats of the continuous observance of
their respective duties. Initiative consists of the trigrams symbolizing the
youngest son and youngest daughter and shows how the attraction and influence
between the sexes is strongest in youth. Consistency on the other hand,
consists of the trigrams symbolizing the oldest son and oldest daughter. This
couple is more staid. The wife occupies the lower place, and their relationship is
32 -- Consistency -- 32

characterized by her submission. Given two parties, a magnetic and a dynamic in
correlation, if both consistently observe what is correct and natural (i.e., the
magnetic submissive and the dynamic firm), then good fortune and progress may
be predicted for their course.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The will to maintain the consistency of the Work assures progress in
whatever direction it may take.

The Superior Man holds fast to the principles of the Work.

Wilhelm's title for this hexagram is Duration. I feel that the word
Consistency best evokes the meaning of the figure. In an existence consisting
of continuous change the only things that have duration are the principles upon
which change is based. To adhere to these principles is to maintain consistency.
Implicit here is a consistent balance of forces. Consistency in the Work means
neither consistent action nor inaction, but an appropriate combination of the two
principles as required by changing circumstances. The Confucian commentary
alludes to this characteristic of the Work when it mentions the sun, moon and
changing seasons as examples of forces which maintain their consistency within a
context of continuous change.

Just as the moon at night reflects the light of the hidden sun, so in the
Work the ego is always magnetic in relation to the dynamic Self. A moon that
thought that it was the source of its light would be egregiously deluded, despite
superficial appearances to the contrary; so too the ego that thinks that its powers
come from anywhere but the Self.

Motives and standards of choice are not invented by the ego but are
structured by the actualization of archetypal predispositions through
personally acquired value standards.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Note that all of the lines in the hexagram are generally unfavorable except
two and five, and that when they both change places the hexagram becomes
number thirty-one, Initiative. There is a profound lesson here which is best
appreciated by meditating on the associations implied. The fact that each
hexagram is the inverse of the other should not be forgotten.
32 -- Consistency -- 32
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject deeply desirous of long
continuance. Even with firm correctness there will be evil; there will be no
advantage in any way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.
Nothing that would further.

Blofeld: To ensure his continuance, he digs a hole for himself. This sort of
determination brings misfortune, for he is unable to go anywhere.

Liu: One seeks duration too insistently; to continue this brings misfortune.
Nothing is of benefit.

Ritsema/Karcher: Diving Persevering, Trial: pitfall. Without direction:
Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Distant constancy; determination is inauspicious; there is no
place beneficial.

Cleary (1): Deep constancy; fidelity brings misfortune. No benefit.

Cleary (2): In deep constancy, fidelity brings misfortune; there is no gain.

Wu: He seeks a lasting relationship from afar. Even though he is earnest, it will
be foreboding and there is nothing to be gained.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The evil attached to the deep desire for long continuance
arises from the deep seeking of it at the commencement of things. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The misfortune arises from wanting too much immediately at the
outset. Blofeld: Misfortune caused by trying to achieve enduring results at the
very beginning. Ritsema/Karcher: Beginning seeking depth indeed. Cleary
(2): The misfortune ... is from seeking depth to start with. Wu: Because he starts
by seeking an intimate relationship.

Legge: Line one has a proper correlate in four, but between them are two
dynamic lines, and it is itself magnetic. These conditions prevent her from
receiving much help from line four. She should be quiet and not be anxious for
action. The emphasis of what is said derives from her being the first
line of the figure, at "the commencement of things."
32 -- Consistency -- 32
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset the man wants to endure. Whatever endures must be
gradually matured. There is no advantage in precipitous action.

Wing: Do not attempt to wholly and quickly embrace a method or system that is
new to you. Life-styles cannot be changed overnight. There are no shortcuts to
reform. Such things are cultivated and matured in order to bring about the
desired results.

Editor: The image depicts compulsive persistence in trying to force an issue or
in seeking a premature synthesis. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram
becomes number thirty-four, Great Power, implying that perhaps you are too
impatient for results. The Work demands change, and often we long for some
measure of stability which is inappropriate to the process taking place.
Ritsema/Karcher translate “Without direction: Harvesting” as: "No plan or
direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not
impose a direction on events." The second clause suggests that circumstances
will improve if you just don't meddle with them.

A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws.
The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.
Abraham Lincoln

A. Don't push the river. You are trying too hard to succeed. Curb your
impatience and allow the Work to go at its own pace. Let things develop
naturally.

B. A premature synthesis. You are jumping to conclusions. The principles
of the Work are your guide to action, not the superficial changes in your milieu.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows all occasion for repentance
disappearing.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse disappears.

Blofeld: Regret vanishes.

Liu: Remorse vanishes. [A stable situation is now possible.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone.
32 -- Consistency -- 32

Cleary (1): Regret disappears.

Wu: Regret disappears.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He can abide long in the due mean. Wilhelm/Baynes: It is
permanently central. Blofeld: The line implies ability to remain upon the
middle path. [I.e. To avoid extremes and cleave to the golden mean. This is
suggested by the position of the line which is central to the lower trigram.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Ability lasting, centering indeed. [The ideogram: field
divided in two equal parts. Image of hexagram 61.] Cleary (2): One can remain
balanced. Wu: (He) can remain in the central position for a long time.

Legge: Line two is dynamic, but in the place of a magnetic line. However,
because of his central position he holds fast to the due mean.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man endures by keeping his force of character within the bounds of
available power.

Wing: Apply just enough consistent force to effect the situation. Too much
energy, or too little, will create chaos. Avoid extremes in your actions.

Editor: Line two is the dynamic correlate of the magnetic fifth line, and thus
becomes the ruler of the hexagram. The meanings of both lines are derived from
this switch of positions. (Ordinarily the fifth place is the seat of the ruler.) If
both lines change, the hexagram becomes number thirty-one, Initiative, with
which the figure is intimately connected, as Legge's notes point out. This
suggests that consistency in the World of the Senses (domain of the ego) allows
the initiative to originate from the World of Thought (the domain of the Self – the
Causal Plane of Theosophy); which is to say that the ego's consistent
perseverance is essential for the transformation of the psyche. The attitude
which is often necessary to accomplish this is symbolized in the IX of Wands in
the Tarot:

This card symbolizes those qualities that cause one to defend principles
which may not be fully understood. And whether or not he understands
what he is doing in its every aspect, he will do it as best he is able.
F.D. Graves -- The Windows of Tarot

A. Your position is correct. Stand fast and preserve the Work.

B. Emanation from inner planes is facilitated by the ego’s skill in managing
the Work.
32 -- Consistency -- 32
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows one who does not continuously maintain
his virtue. There are those who will impute this to him as a disgrace. However
firm he may be, there will be ground for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He who does not give duration to his character meets with
disgrace. Persistent humiliation.

Blofeld: He is not consistently virtuous and therefore meets with disgrace. To
continue thus would be shameful.

Liu: If he does not continue to improve his character, he will be disgraced.
Continuing (not to improve) brings humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not preserving one's actualizing-tao. Maybe receiving's
embarrassing. Trial: abashment. [Actualize-tao: Ability to follow the course
traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos. Linked with acquire, TE:
acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Shaughnessy: Not making constant his virtue, he perhaps receives its disgrace;
determination is distressful.

Cleary (1): If one is not constant in virtue, one may be shamed; even if right,
one is humiliated.

Cleary (2): Not being constant in virtue may be taken as a disgrace. Even if one
is right, one is humiliated.

Wu: The subject does not persevere in principle. He may feel humiliated for his
support. Even though he does nothing wrong, he will be remorseful.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He does not continuously maintain his virtue -- nowhere
will he be borne with. Wilhelm/Baynes: He meets with no toleration.
Blofeld: Because, then, no one could endure him. [We can bear with an evil
man more easily than with one who is liable to behave so inconsistently that we
never know what to expect of him.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Without a place to
tolerate indeed. Cleary (2): There is no accommodation. Wu: Consequently, he
will not be welcome.

Legge: The third line is dynamic in a dynamic place, but has passed the center
position of the lower trigram. He is too active, and coming under the attraction
of his sixth line correlate, he is impelled to abandon his place and virtue. The
32 -- Consistency -- 32

K'ang-hsi editors' version of the commentary is: "Nowhere can he bear to
remain."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not maintain an inner consistency of character. His
vicissitudes lead to troubles from unforeseen quarters.

Wing: Your reactions and moods caused by external situations are as
unpredictable as these varying circumstances. This inconsistency within the Self
will bring your humiliation. In turn, this creates a cycle of difficulties. Try to
center yourself.

Editor: To parody Emerson: "A foolish inconsistency is the hobgoblin of
small minds."

There is nothing worse than to begin work on oneself and then leave it
and find oneself between two stools.
Gurdjieff

A. Inconstancy and vacillation threaten the Work.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows a field where there is no game.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No game in the field.

Blofeld: No game in the field.

Liu: No birds in the field. For a long time one is out of place. How can one get
birds. [If you receive this line, you should not expect success, even with
heightened efforts. Rather, be wary of losing your present position.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The fields without wildfowl.

Shaughnessy: In the fields there is no game.

Cleary(1): Fields, no game.

Wu: He hunts, but his bag is empty.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Going for long to what is not his proper place, how can he
get game? Wilhelm/Baynes: When one is forever absent from one's place, how
32 -- Consistency -- 32

can one find game? Blofeld: How can one who remains long out of place hope
to gain his quarry? [ A reference to the unsuitable position of this line. An
example of what is implied is furnished by people whose talents and interests
incline them towards a profession quite different from the one in which they are
employed; with the best will in the world, they cannot do justice to themselves.]
Ritsema/Karcher: No lasting whatever: one's situation. Quietly acquiring the
wildfowl indeed. Cleary(2): This is not the place for persistence. How can one
catch game? Wu: He has not been in the right place for a long period of time.
How can he have bagged any game?

Legge: Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place, thus suggesting the symbolism.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Perseverance alone does not assure success. No amount of stalking will lead
to game in a field that has none.

Wing: Be certain your goals are realistic. If you try to achieve things that are
unlikely, no matter how vigorously, you will still accomplish absolutely nothing.
Perhaps you should re-evaluate your desires.

Editor: There is sometimes an implication in this line that if you would just sit
still maybe the game would come to you.

The dead came back from Jerusalem, where they did not find what they
were seeking.
Jung -- VII Sermones ad Mortuos

A. You can't find what you seek where it doesn't exist.

B. Your present course of action is fruitless, or your speculation is
incorrect.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject continuously maintaining the
virtue indicated by it. In a wife this will be fortunate; in a husband, evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance.
This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.

Blofeld: Making a virtue of marital constancy is a type of persistence which
brings good fortune to women, but is harmful to men. [Here "constancy" is used
in the limited sense of devotion to husband or wife and willingness to submit
absolutely to his or her judgment.]
32 -- Consistency -- 32

Liu: Firmly instilling duration in one's character is good fortune for a woman,
but not for a man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Persevering one's actualizing-tao: Trial. Wife people:
significant. The husband, the son: pitfall. [Actualize-tao: Ability to follow the
course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos. Linked with acquire, TE:
acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to
be.]

Shaughnessy: Making constant his virtue; determination is auspicious for the
wife, inauspicious for the husband.

Cleary(1): Constancy in virtue; this righteousness is good for a woman, bad for a
man.

Cleary (2): The fidelity of constancy in virtue bodes well for a woman, bodes ill
for a man.

Wu: The subject perseveres in principle. This is auspicious for a woman, but
ominous for a man.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Such firm correctness in a wife will be fortunate -- it is
hers to the end of life to follow with an unchanged mind. The husband must
decide what is right, and lay down the rule accordingly -- for him to follow like a
wife is evil. Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune for a woman,
because she follows one man all her life. A man must hold to his duty; if he
follows the woman, the results are bad. Blofeld: A woman follows one lord for
the whole of her life, but men have to hold to their public duties. For them to
subordinate themselves to women would bring shame upon them. Ritsema/
Karcher: Adhering-to the-one and-also completing indeed. Adhering-to the
wife: pitfall indeed. Cleary (2): What bodes well in fidelity for a woman is
consistency from start to finish. For a man doing his duty, to follow a woman
bodes ill. Wu: She perseveres in playing her devoted role to the very end.
Ominous for a man, because he should judge each issue on its merit and not
follow the role of a woman.

Legge: The magnetic fifth line responds to the dynamic second, and may be
supposed to represent a wife conscious of her weakness, and docilely submissive,
which is correct. A husband, however, and a man generally, has to assert himself,
and lay down the rule of what is right. From line five it appears that what is right
will vary in different cases. The lesson of the hexagram is perseverance in what is
right in each particular case.
32 -- Consistency -- 32
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is faithful to tradition and submits meekly. These are desirable
virtues for a wife but not for a man of affairs. He should be flexible and assertive,
according to the demands of duty and the tenor of the times.

Wing: When you are seeking earthly things, apply earthly methods. When your
goals are lofty and ambitious, your methods must be inventive and daring. Learn
to apply the appropriate kind of effort to achieve the effect you desire.

Editor: What appears to be outrageous sexism is seen to be a profound truth
when interpreted symbolically. The wife is emotion, the husband reason, and the
line examines the crucial division of labor between them. Reason must be
flexible or it becomes petrified into dogma; emotion must remain firm and not
give in to impulse or it becomes uncontrolled passion. The circumstances of each
situation dictate their proper response. In the flux and flow of life, mindless
adherence to "precedent" is the strategy of shysters and dogmatists.

For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is
a flame that burns to its own destruction.
Kahlil Gibran -- The Prophet

A. Control your emotions and allow reason to make the choices. Reason
should at all times be flexible and allow itself to be guided by the requirements of
the time. Emotion, on the other hand, must always maintain a firm adherence to
the principles of moderation and restraint.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject exciting herself to long
continuance. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.

Blofeld: Prolonged violent exercise -- misfortune! [This implies violent activity
directed to wrong ends and therefore barren of result.]

Liu: Continuous agitation means misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Rousing Persevering: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Distant constancy; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Constancy of excitement is bad.

Cleary (2): Constant excitement bodes ill.
32 -- Consistency -- 32

Wu: He changes his constant course. This is foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Far will she be from achieving merit. Wilhelm/Baynes:
Restlessness as an enduring condition in a high position is wholly without merit.
Blofeld: The prolonged violent exercise signified by this line is completely void
of worthwhile results. Ritsema/Karcher: The great without achievement
indeed. Cleary (2): Constant excitement in those on top is utterly unsuccessful.
Wu: Changing his constant course at the last stage will not accomplish anything.

Legge: The principle of perseverance has run its course and the energy of the
upper trigram of Movement is exhausted. The line itself is magnetic, and her
violent efforts can only lead to evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man in a high position is perpetually excited and restless. As a result he
does not have the inner composure necessary for positive contributions. His
motive power is soon exhausted by violent efforts.

Wing: If you handle your affairs in a perpetual state of anxiety, you will soon
exhaust yourself. More could be accomplished with a calm and composed
demeanor. Make an attempt to comprehend and align yourself with what is truly
happening before you create serious problems for yourself.

Editor: Legge's interpretation of this line is inconsistent with the other
translators, depicting "foolish consistency" as the problem, whereas Wilhelm,
Blofeld and Liu all identify it as "consistent foolishness." (Ritsema/Karcher's
"literal English" could be interpreted either way.) My experience endorses the
majority opinion. The line often reminds us how anticipation is inconsistent with
centeredness. Perhaps you're trying too hard. "Be here now" -- allow the Work to
unfold as it will.

Favorinus tells how Epictetus would also say that there were two faults
far graver and fouler than any others - inability to bear, and inability to
forbear, when we neither patiently bear the blows that must be borne,
nor abstain from the things and the pleasures we ought to abstain from.
The Golden Sayings of Epictetus

A. The times call for endurance, but you are not enduring the times.
Constant fretting wears down the soul.

33 -- Retreat -- 33
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-THREE --
RETREAT

Other titles: The Symbol of Retirement, Yielding, Withdrawal, Retiring,
Wielding, Strategic Withdrawal, Inaccessibility, Disassociation from Inferior
Forces, “When an opportunity for something better comes along, do not quarrel
with an impossible situation.” -- D. F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Retreat means successful progress. Advantage comes from firm
correctness and attention to details.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Retreat. Success. In what is small, perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Yielding. Success! Persistence in small things wins advantage. [Much
of the teaching of the Book of Change is concerned with the wisdom of
restraint or withdrawal as the best way of achieving our goal under certain
circumstances; so this hexagram is not necessarily unfavorable to the wise. This
is not a time when we can hope to achieve much; but attention to small matters
will stand us in good stead later.]

Liu: Retreat. Success. To persist in small matters is of benefit.

Ritsema/Karcher: Retiring, Growing. The small: Harvesting Trial. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of conflict and consequent
seclusion. It emphasizes that withdrawing from the affairs at hand to conceal
yourself in obscurity is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the
time, you are told to: retire!]

Shaughnessy: Wielding: Receipt; little beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): Withdrawal is developmental. The small is beneficial and correct.

Cleary (2): Withdrawal is successful. Small benefit is correct.

Wu: Retreat indicates pervasion. It will be advantageous for the little men to be
persevering.
The Image

Legge: A mountain beneath the sky -- the image of Retreat. The superior man
keeps inferior men at a distance by his dignified bearing rather than hostility.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Wilhelm/Baynes: Mountain under heaven: the image of Retreat. Thus the
superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance, not angrily but with reserve.
[He does not hate him, for hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which
we are bound to the hated object.]

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes mountains beneath the sky. The Superior
Man, by keeping his distance from men of inferior character, avoids having to
display wrath and preserves his dignity. [The component trigrams, symbolizing
mountain and sky, indicate withdrawal to a solitary place when circumstances
are unfavorable.]

Liu: The mountain beneath the sky symbolizes Retreat. The superior man
keeps his distance from the inferior, not with anger, but with dignity.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below heaven possessing mountain. Retiring. A chun tzu
uses distancing Small People. A chun tzu uses not hating and-also intimidating.

Cleary (1): There are mountains under heaven, which is inaccessible. Thus do
superior people keep petty people at a distance, being stern without ill will.

Cleary (2): ... Being strict without ill will. [Petty people can be useful, so there is
no ill-will, but their pettiness cannot wield authority, so be strict. In terms of
learning to be a sage, the celestial ruler is the master, and the physical body
takes orders from it, so that the desires of the various parts of the body cannot
cause disturbance.]

Wu: There is a mountain under heaven; this is Retreat. Thus the jun zi
distances himself from the little men, not because of despising them, but because
of maintaining his own esteem. [The difference between the jun zi and the little
men is one of education and not of birth. Confucius was a teacher first and a
philosopher second, for he said: “Education is classless.” Every one of us has the
potential of becoming a sage.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is progress in Retreat. The dynamic ruler in the fifth
place receives a proper response from his correlate in line two. The action is in
accordance with the requirements of the time because what is inferior is
gradually increasing and advancing. The actions required during a Retreat are
of great significance.

Legge: Retreat is the hexagram of the sixth month when the yin influence,
represented by the two magnetic lines, has established a foothold. This suggests
the growth of inferior and unprincipled men in the state, before whose advance
superior men are obliged to retire. Yet the auspice of Retreat is not all bad. By
firm correctness the threatened evil may be arrested to some extent. Ch'eng-tzu
33 -- Retreat -- 33

says: “Below the sky is the mountain. The mountain rises up below the sky, and
its height is arrested, while the sky goes up higher and higher, till they come to
be apart from each other. In this we have an emblem of retiring and avoiding.”

Anthony: The correct time for retreat comes when others are not receptive to us,
when delicacy of feeling is lost, when we begin to be attacked by doubt, or when
our actions no longer yield progress. The person who can hold his ego in check
has many creative moments open to him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: When carried out with shrewd discernment, Retreat is a strategy
for success.

The Superior Man removes himself from disintegrating forces without calling
attention to himself. He controls his weaknesses by maintaining his serious
purpose.

With the possible exception of line two, there is very little ambiguity
in the hexagram of Retreat. Without changing lines it is a clear injunction to
remove yourself from an inferior situation, influence, emotion or way of thinking.
The figure has certain affinities with hexagram number forty- four: Temptation
which also depicts an inferior element encroaching from below.

To yield is to be preserved whole.
Lao-tse

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare hexagrams number forty-four, Temptation; number thirty-
three, Retreat; and number twelve, Divorcement; in that order. What are the
next three logical hexagrams in the sequence, and what are the implications of
the series as a whole?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows a retiring tail. The position is perilous. No
movement in any direction should be made.

Wilhelm/Baynes: At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous. One must not
undertake anything. [Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is
retreating, the lowest line represents the tail and the top line the head. In a
retreat it is advantageous to be at the front.]

Blofeld: Withdrawal to the hindermost point -- trouble! It is useless to seek any
goal or destination at such a time.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Liu: The tail in retreat. (Someone closely following.) Danger. No undertakings.

Ritsema/Karcher: Retiring tail, adversity. No availing-of possessing directed
going.

Shaughnessy: Wield the tail; danger; do not herewith have any place to go.

Cleary (1): Withdrawing the tail is dangerous; don’t go anywhere with this.

Wu: To retreat in the rear is perilous. He should not undertake it.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If no movement is made, what disaster can there be?
Wilhelm/Baynes: If one undertakes nothing while exposed to the danger of the
retreating tail, what misfortune could befall one? Blofeld: If you refrain from
moving back so far what misfortune can overtake you? Ritsema/ Karcher: Not
going wherefore calamity indeed. Cleary (2): If you do not go anywhere, what
trouble will there be? Wu: How can retreat in the rear be perilous if he does not
undertake it?

Legge: A retiring tail suggests the idea of the subject of the line hurrying away,
which would only aggravate the evil and danger of the time.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is in a perilous position at the end of the retreating
column still in contact with the enemy. No action should be undertaken under
such circumstances.

Wing: Your position in the situation is in close proximity to an adversary. It
would have been to your advantage to Retreat earlier. Do not take any action
now, as it will only invite danger.

Anthony: Our ego keeps engaged with the negative power through looking at
and examining the issue. We may be considering a compromise with the evil
element, or remain involved with desire, fear, anger, impatience or anxiety. We
must disconnect, not looking at the situation with our mind’s eye.

Editor: In vulgar English: "Your ass is exposed!" This suggests the analogy of
being threatened by a barking dog -- the surest way to be bitten is to show fear
and run. The best strategy is to remain as calm as possible, and then slowly back
off. Ritsema/Karcher's definition of "adversity" includes the idea of a malevolent
spiritual force: "pacifying or exorcizing such a spirit can have a healing effect."
33 -- Retreat -- 33

The discreet man sees danger and takes shelter, the ignorant go forward
and pay for it.
Proverbs 22:3

A. You are exposed and vulnerable. Stay calm -- do nothing rash when
exposed to threatening forces and you'll survive.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject holding her purpose as if by
a thong made from the hide of a yellow ox, which cannot be broken.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He holds him fast with yellow ox-hide. No one can tear him
loose.

Blofeld: He bound it with thongs of yellow ox-hide and no one could untie it.

Liu: If his will is strong, like yellow ox-hide, no one can dissuade him.

Ritsema/Karcher: Holding-on-to it: availing-of yellow cattle's skin.
Absolutely-nothing has mastering stimulating.

Shaughnessy: Uphold it using a yellow ox's bridle; no one will succeed in
overturning it.

Cleary (1): Use the hide of a yellow ox to fasten this; no one can loosen it.

Wu: He holds fast to his decision with the hide of a yellow cow. Nobody can
dissuade him.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her purpose is firm. Wilhelm/Baynes: This means a firm
will. Blofeld: This symbolizes a powerful will. Ritsema/Karcher: Firm
purpose indeed. Cleary (2): (This) means making the will firm. Wu: Indicates a
firm will.

Legge: "Her purpose" in line two is the purpose to withdraw. The magnetic two
responds correctly to the dynamic fifth line, and both are central. The purpose
therefore is symbolized as in the text. The yellow color of the ox is introduced
because of its being correct, and of a piece with the central place of the line.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man holds fast to the purpose of withdrawal but with due moderation.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Wing: You lack sufficient strength to make a complete withdrawal. If you can
maintain a strong desire to Retreat or align yourself with one in a position to
guide you, you can make your escape.

Anthony: Our own inferiors want, and ultimately have a right to justice. Justice
may not, however, be procured through the demands and leadership of our ego.
It will come about only through the firm leadership of our superior self, which
through perseverance and disengagement, wins the help of the hidden world.

Editor: There is a fair amount of ambiguity in this line, and the meaning can
fluctuate according to circumstances. Most translations refer to "will" or
"purpose" in either the line or its Confucian commentary -- this is a reference to
the strong ox-hide. Because the meaning of the hexagram is derived from the
symbolism of inferior forces encroaching from below (which includes this line), it
could be interpreted as a tenacious negative influence operating in the situation.
"Will" associated with an inferior entity could relate to the uncanny power of
instincts and passions within the psyche. On the other hand, the ox-hide is
yellow, and this is the color of the mean. The line is also central with a proper
correlate, so the auspice can also be positive. Wilhelm comments that it
symbolizes an inferior man who wants to change his status, and holds fast to the
superior man above him. He likens the situation to Jacob's battle with the angel
in Genesis 32:

And there was one that wrestled with him until daybreak who seeing that
he could not master him, struck him in the socket of his hip, and Jacob's
hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him. He said, "Let me go, for day
is breaking." But Jacob answered, "I will not let you go unless you bless
me." He then asked, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he replied. He said,
"Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have been
strong against God, you shall prevail against men."

A. By holding fast to a superior principle, a weak element escapes from
danger.

B. The image of an entrenched inferior power.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows one retiring but bound -- to his distress
and peril. If he were to deal with his binders as in nourishing a servant or
concubine, it would be fortunate for him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A halted retreat is nerve-wracking and dangerous. To retain
people as men-and maidservants brings good fortune.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Blofeld: Yielding under constraint results in ills and trouble, but there is good
fortune in store for those who are supporting servants and concubines.

Liu: Retreat with entanglements is dangerous and leads to illness. Take care of
women and subordinates. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Tied Retiring. Possessing afflicting adversity. Accumulating
servants, concubines, significant.

Shaughnessy: Do the wielding; there is sickness; danger; keeping servants and
consorts is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Entangled withdrawal has affliction, but it is lucky in terms of
feeding servants and concubines.

Cleary (2): Entangled in withdrawal, there is affliction and danger, but feeding
servants and concubines leads to good results.

Wu: The retreat is tied to a string. It will be ominous to have illness, but
auspicious to have maids and servants.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The peril is due to distress and exhaustion. A great affair
cannot be dealt with in this way. Wilhelm/Baynes: The danger of a halted
retreat is nerve- wracking; this brings fatigue. "To retain people as men-and
maidservants brings good fortune." True enough, but one cannot use them in
great things. Blofeld: The evils referred to here are those attendant on extreme
fatigue. Though supporting servants and concubines brings good fortune, it does
not lead to achieving anything of consequence. [Seemingly, Confucius, always
inclined to be austere, does not altogether approve of this type of good fortune.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing afflicting weariness indeed. Not permitting
Great Affairs indeed. Cleary (2): Affliction and exhaustion. Not suitable for
great works. Wu: Illness can be wasting. No big business is achievable.

Legge: Line three has no proper correlate in line six, and he allows himself to be
entangled and impeded by the first and second lines. Because he is too familiar
with them they are presumptuous and fetter his movements. He should keep
them at a distance.

Wu: The subject of this yang position feels that he is attached to the occupant of
the second (line), a yin position. This sentimental attachment, symbolized here as
the string attachment, hinders his freedom to retreat. Under these circumstances
it is all right for him to handle small matters, such as hiring domestic help, but no
big business.
33 -- Retreat -- 33
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man loses his freedom of action during retreat. The hangers-on impede
and fetter his movements. The expedient course of action is to employ them in
such a way as to retain the initiative. But he must maintain an appropriate
distance from them and not rely on expedient actions of this kind in dealing with
important matters.

Wing: You've been held back from Retreat and consequently are in the center
of a difficult situation. Inferior persons or ideals may surround you. They can be
used to insulate you from further difficulties, but you can accomplish nothing
significant while fettered by inferior elements.

Editor: The image suggests being held back by inferior or subordinate forces
within the situation. Ritsema/Karcher explain that "Possessing afflicting
adversity" can connote "a spirit that seeks revenge by inflicting suffering on the
living. Pacifying or exorcizing such a spirit can have a healing effect." (I have
received this line when exactly that meaning was implied in the query.)
Psychologically, sublimation is indicated. This is the art of making negative
energy "sublime," i.e.: positive. "Servants and concubines" sometimes symbolize
subconscious complexes: their libido can be either positive or negative,
depending upon how it is treated. Remember that the proper nourishment of
libido is not the same as indulging it.

For the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere
requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and
impede us in the search after true being; it fills us full of loves, and lusts,
and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and in fact, as
men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all. Whence come
wars, and fightings, and factions? Whence but from the body and the
lusts of the body?
Plato -- Phaedo

A. Encumbered and exhausted -- make the most of whatever advantages
you have to harmonize the situation.

B. Sublimate, placate or otherwise transform inferior forces to serve your
higher purposes.

C. "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject retiring notwithstanding his
likings. In a superior man this will lead to good fortune. An inferior man cannot
attain to this.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Wilhelm/Baynes: Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man
and downfall to the inferior man.

Blofeld: Withdrawal for good reasons -- for the Superior Man, good fortune; for
people of mean attainments, misfortune!

Liu: Voluntary retreat is good fortune for the superior man, but not for the
inferior man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Loving Retiring. A chun tzu significant. Small People
obstructing.

Shaughnessy: Good wielding; for the gentleman auspicious, for the little man
negative.

Cleary (1): A superior person who withdraws well is fortunate, an inferior
person is not.

Cleary (2): Developed people who withdraw in the right way are fortunate; petty
people are not.

Wu: To retreat from what he is fond of is easy for a Jun zi, but not so for a little
man.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A superior man retires notwithstanding his likings; an
inferior man cannot attain to this. Wilhelm/Baynes: The superior man retreats
voluntarily; this brings downfall for the inferior man. Blofeld: For when, quite
rightly, the Superior Man withdraws, lesser men are bound to suffer. Ritsema/
Karcher: A chun tzu lovingly Retiring. Small People obstructing indeed. Cleary
(2): Developed people withdraw well; petty people do not. Wu: The Jun zi uses
retreat to his advantage, but the little man doesn’t.

Legge: Line four has a proper correlate in the magnetic first line, but as four is
the first line in the upper trigram of Strength, he is free to exercise his choice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man withdraws, despite his desire to do otherwise. The superior man
can retreat in a friendly way, adjusting to the situation, and retaining his
convictions. The inferior man is unable to do this.

Wing: If you recognize the moment for Retreat, be certain that you do so with
the proper attitude -- that is, willingly. In this way you will adjust easily and
33 -- Retreat -- 33

progress in your new environment. Those who are filled with emotional turmoil
during withdrawal will suffer greatly.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, to "retire notwithstanding one's likings" is
to exercise willpower over an inferior impulse for the good of the Work. The
image suggests that you have the requisite strength to do this. It is a truism that
when positive libido is withdrawn from something, unsupported inferior forces
must wane.

The good is one thing, the pleasant another; these two, having different
objects, chain a man. It is well with him who clings to the good; he who
chooses the pleasant, misses the end.
Katha Upanishad

A. Despite your desires, abandon your proposed plan of action. To ignore
temptation strengthens the will and robs weakness of its power.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject retiring in an admirable way.
With firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: An admirably carried out withdrawal. Persistence in a righteous course
brings good fortune.

Liu: Appropriate retreat. To continue brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Excellence Retiring, Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Enjoyable wielding; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Excellent withdrawal; correctness is auspicious.

Wu: The commendable retreat is auspicious if persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to the rectitude of his purpose. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Because the will thereby reaches a correct decision. Blofeld: This
results from a withdrawal carried out as a result of rectifying our aims. [I.e.
revising them in the light of unfavorable circumstances.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Using correcting the purpose indeed.) Cleary (2): Because of right aspiration.
Wu: He needs to put his aims in the right perspective.
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Legge: The K'ang-hsi editors refer to the words of I Yin as an illustration of what
is said in line five: "The superior man will not for favor or gain continue in an
office whose work is done." He advances or withdraws according to the character
of the time. The strength and correct position of the fifth line show that he is able
to maintain himself, and as he is responded to by the magnetic second line, no
opposition would come from any of the others. Therefore, he is free to keep his
place, but since he recognizes the advance of inferior men in lines one and two,
he deems it better to withdraw from the field for a time. Thus there is successful
progress even in his retreat.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man recognizes the proper time for an admirable retirement with
necessary amenities and without disagreeableness. Firmness in the rectitude of
his purpose is necessary to guard against being misled by irrelevant issues.

Wing: Make your Retreat friendly but firm. Do not be drawn into irrelevant
discussions or considerations concerning your decisions. A persevering
withdrawal brings good fortune.

Editor: Both Legge and Blofeld use the concept of rectification in their
translations of the Confucian commentary. [Rectify: 1.a: to make or set right:
remedy. 2.a: to restore to a healthy state.] The idea is that one must pleasantly
but firmly disassociate oneself from an inferior alliance -- the only hope of
improvement lies in withdrawal from the scene.

A faultless person is one who withdraws from affairs. This must be done
with strength.
Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai

A. Withdraw to make correct – don’t make a big deal of it.

B. The integrity of the Work demands a withdrawal from an inferior
alliance.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject retiring in a noble way. It
will be advantageous in every respect.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.

Blofeld: A "sleek" withdrawal -- everything is favorable! [The Chinese
commentators suggest that this means going to live in retirement. They add that
the phrase also implies excellent health.]
33 -- Retreat -- 33

Liu: Retreat after success. Everything is favorable.

Ritsema/Karcher: Rich Retiring, without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Fattened wielding; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): Rich withdrawal is wholly beneficial.

Cleary (2): Withdrawal of the rich is beneficial to all.

Wu: Retreat at his leisure is never disadvantageous.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He who does so has no doubts about his course. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Because there is no longer any possibility of doubt. Blofeld: In this
case, there cannot be the smallest doubt. [I.e. not the smallest doubt as to the
wisdom of withdrawal.] Ritsema/Karcher: Without a place to doubt indeed.
Cleary (2): Wu: His mind is free from doubt.

Legge: Line six is dynamic, with no correlate in line three to detain him. He
vigorously and happily carries out the idea of the hexagram.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: No doubt exists as to the need for retirement. The man resigns in a gracious
manner.

Wing: You are sufficiently removed from the situation and able to Retreat
without guilt or doubt. Here you are blessed with great good fortune. You will
find rewarding success in your endeavors.

Editor: The image suggests that you already know what to do in the situation at
hand -- remove yourself without further ado.

It is because [the Sage] does not contend that no one in the world can
contend against him.
Lao-Tse

A. You can remove yourself from the situation at hand with a clear
conscience.

B. Do not hesitate to abandon an inferior idea immediately.

C. Image of a high-minded or spiritually motivated withdrawal.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-FOUR --
GREAT POWER

Other titles: The Power of the Great, The Symbol of Great Vigor, Persons of
Great Authority, Great Strength, Great Invigorating, Great Maturity,
Accumulated Force, The Strength of the Mighty, Righteous Power, Excessive
Force

Judgment

Legge: Great Power necessitates firm correctness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: The Power of the Great. Persistence in a righteous course brings
reward. [This hexagram with a solid group of firm lines topped by a small
number of yielding lines obviously signifies strength -- in this case the power to
succeed in spite of difficulties. Much of what follows concerns goats -- a symbol
presumably suggested by the form of the hexagram, namely a solid body
distinguished by a pair of horns -- the yielding lines at the top.]

Liu: Great Power. It is of benefit to continue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Great Invigorating, Harvesting Trial. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of the invigorating power of a central creative
idea. It emphasizes that animating everything around you through this guiding
motivation is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you
are told to invigorate through the great!]

Shaughnessy: Great Maturity: Beneficial to determine.

Cleary(1): Great power is beneficial when correct.

Wu: Great Strength indicates that it is advantageous to be persevering.

The Image

Legge: The image of thunder over heaven forms the hexagram of Great
Power. The superior man, in accordance with this, does not take one step that is
not in accordance with propriety.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder in heaven above: The image of The Power of the
Great. Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths that do not accord
with established order.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder in the sky. The Superior Man never
takes a step involving impropriety. [Note: The combination of trigrams
meaning thunder and sky suggests something of the awe-inspiring quality of
the truly great.]

Liu: Thunder in the sky above symbolizes Great Power. The superior man's
conduct does not oppose the rules.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder located above heaven. Great Invigorating. A
chun tzu uses no codes whatever, nowhere treading.

Cleary (1): Thunder is up in the sky, with great power. Thus do superior
people refrain from what is improper.

Cleary (2): ... Developed people do not do what is improper.

Wu: There is thunder above heaven; this is Great Strength. Thus the jun zi
does not practice what is not proper.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Great Power we see that which is great becoming
strong. The trigram of Strength directs the trigram of Movement, and hence the
whole is expressive of vigor. But that which is great necessitates firm correctness.
The attributes of heaven and earth are displayed when firmness and correctness
attain their ideal state.

Legge: Because the dynamic lines predominate in Great Power, the figure
suggests a state in which there is an abundance of strength and vigor. Is strength
alone enough for the conduct of affairs? Of course not! Strength must always be
subordinated to the idea of right, and exerted only in harmony with it.

The lower trigram symbolizes Strength, the upper symbolizes Movement.
In the Confucian commentary, "that which is great” denotes the group of four
dynamic lines which strikes us on looking at the figure, and also the superior men
in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. That the attributes
of heaven and earth are displayed means that the power of men should be a
reflection of the great power which we see impartially working in nature.

Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image: "Thunder rolling in the sky and making all
things shake is the symbol of Great Power." In relating its application to man,
he quotes a beautiful saying of antiquity: "The strong man is he who overcomes
himself."
34 -- Great Power -- 34
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Control yourself.

The Superior Man does nothing that is not in accordance with the principles of
the Work.

Wilhelm and Blofeld translate this hexagram as The Power of the
Great., but I prefer Liu's rendition of Great Power, because it has a more
neutral connotation. The Power of the Great suggests the might of kings and
emperors, and implies "superior" power wielded at one's own discretion. It is too
easy to misinterpret this hexagram as a clear injunction to take unilateral action.
Such is seldom the case -- the hexagram depicts a charge of latent energy which
must be properly managed.

The figure is usually compared with the image of a ram or goat -- the four
lower dynamic lines being the body, and the two upper magnetic lines
representing the horns. Since this hexagram is the preceding figure of Retreat
turned upside down, one can imagine the two together as a person retreating
across a pasture pursued by a charging beast. The ram/goat is mentioned in four
of the six lines of the hexagram. This is certainly Great Power, but in such a
crude form it cannot be truthfully called The Power of the Great.

Truly Great Power, as the Judgment tells us, is derived from our will to
restrain our emotions, instincts and appetites. Note that lines two and four are
the most positively forceful lines in the hexagram and that both imply restraint of
power as the proper way to attain one's goals. Without changing lines, the
hexagram sometimes refers to provocations in which one is "legitimately”
tempted to a self-righteous display of "power.” Remember that other people's
ego-trips are none of your concern: the superior man does not respond to them
with other than dignified reserve. Regard it as a test and be joyful if you pass it!

Everything found in later literature seems to indicate that these
meditative schools required a strong discipline and faithful adherence to
a strict regimen. The schools were extremely demanding, and were open
only to those willing to devote themselves totally. Before even being
admitted to one of these ancient meditative schools, a person had to be
not only spiritually advanced but in complete control of all his emotions
and feelings. Beyond that, the disciplines of the Torah and
commandments were central to these schools, and these disciplines
required a degree of self-mastery to which not everyone could aspire.
Aryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation

34 -- Great Power -- 34
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject manifesting his strength in his
toes. But advance will lead to evil -- most certainly.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Power in the toes. Continuing brings misfortune. This is
certainly true.

Blofeld: Power in the toes. [I.e. power of a rather low or limited kind.] To
advance now would bring misfortune.

Liu: Power in the toes. Actions lead to misfortune. This is true.

Ritsema/Karcher: Invigorating tending-towards the feet. Chastising: pitfall,
possessing conformity.

Shaughnessy: Mature in the foot; to be upright is inauspicious; there is a
return.

Cleary (1): With power in the feet, it is inauspicious to go forth on an expedition

    there is truth in this.

Cleary (2): With power in the feet, an expedition bodes ill, having certainty.

Wu: Having strength in the toes indicates foreboding to proceed, confidence
notwithstanding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This will certainly lead to exhaustion. Wilhelm/Baynes:
This certainly leads to failure. Blofeld: The confidence symbolized by power in
the toes is soon exhausted. Ritsema/Karcher: One's conforming exhausted
indeed. Cleary (2): With power in the feet, that certainty comes to an impasse.
Wu: Confidence has been misplaced.

Legge: This line is dynamic, in its correct place, and is the first line of the lower
trigram of Strength in the hexagram of Great Power. The essence of the
hexagram might seem to be concentrated in it and hence we see it symbolized by
"strength in the toes," or "advancing." But such action is
too bold to be undertaken by one in the lowest place, and in addition there is no
proper correlate in line four. From exhaustion will follow distress and other evils.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man in a lowly situation possesses great energy. Seeking
advancement through force, however, will bring misfortune.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Wing: Even though you have the strength, proceeding with your plan would be a
mistake. You must not force this issue because you are not in a position to do so
successfully.

Editor: Compare this line with the definition of compulsion:

Compulsion: 1a. an act of compelling: a driving by force, power,
pressure, or necessity. 2. an irresistible impulse to perform an irrational
act.

The power is in the toes, the lowest part of the body, and the very bottom
of the hexagram. This suggests a compulsive, unconscious drive, or an ill-
considered impulse to act. If it is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes
number thirty-two, Consistency, Duration or Standing Fast, which is the
implied proper response here. In its most neutral interpretation, this line images
a strong urge or impetus to take action.

"Men are only apparently drawn from in front; in reality they are
pushed from behind;" they think they are led on by what they see, when
in truth they are driven on by what they feel, -- by instincts of whose
operation they are half the time unconscious.
W. Durant -- (Quoting Schopenhauer) The Story of Philosophy

A. An inner force seeks expression. Quell your impulse to act.

B. "Don't jump to conclusions."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows that with firm correctness there will be
good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings good fortune.

Liu: Persistence brings good fortune. It (the second line) is in the center (the
middle way).

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Rectitude is auspicious.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Cleary (2): Correctness is auspicious.

Wu: Perseverance will bring auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Because he is in the center and exemplifies the due mean.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Because it is in the central place. Blofeld: This is indicated
by the line's central position in the lower trigram. Ritsema/ Karcher: Using
centering indeed. Cleary (2): Because of balance. Wu: Because the second line
is central.

Legge: The strength of line two is tempered by his being in a magnetic place
which is also in the center. With firm correctness there will be good fortune. The
central position and the due moral mean in line two are illustrative of the maxim:
"The strong man is he who overcomes himself."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The way begins to open for growth and progress. Exuberant self-confidence
needs to be tempered by continued inner equilibrium in the use of power.

Wing: Moderation now is the key to lasting success. Do not allow yourself to
become overconfident because you meet with such little resistance in your efforts.
Use your power carefully.

Editor: The symbolism of the line, and Legge's commentary point out the fact
that willpower is the cornerstone of the Work.

A man is, above all, his will. As is his will in this life, so does he become
when he departs from it. Therefore should his will be fixed on attaining
Brahman.
Chandogya Upanishad

A. Willpower succeeds.

B. "Don't give up the ship."
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows, in the case of an inferior man, one
using all his strength; and in the case of a superior man, one whose rule is not to
do so. Even with firm correctness the position would be perilous. The exercise of
strength in it might be compared to the case of a ram butting against a fence, and
getting his horns entangled.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Wilhelm/Baynes: The inferior man works through power. The superior man
does not act thus. To continue is dangerous. A goat butts against a hedge and
gets its horns entangled.

Blofeld: Inferior men use their power where (under the circumstances
prevailing) the Superior Man refrains from using his. Persistence now would
bring serious consequences, as when a goat butts against a hedge and gets its
horns entangled.

Liu: The inferior man uses his power, while the superior man does not. The goat
butts against a hedge, entangling his horns. To continue is dangerous.

Ritsema/Karcher: Small People avail-of Invigorating. A chun tzu avails-of
absence. Trial: adversity. The he goat butts a hedge. Ruining his horns.

Shaughnessy: The little man uses maturity, the gentleman uses loss;
determination is dangerous. A ram butts a fence, and weakens its horns.

Cleary (1): For inferior people the use is powerful, but for superior people the
use is nil. It is dangerous to persist in this, goat, etc.

Cleary (2): Petty people use power; superior people use nothingness, chaste in
danger, goat, etc.

Wu: A little man deploys strength indiscreetly; a jun zi doe not do so. There is
peril ahead, goat, etc.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The inferior man uses all his strength; in the case of the
superior man it is his rule not to do so. Wilhelm/Baynes: The inferior man
uses his power. This the superior man does not do. Blofeld: This means that
inferior men use their power and the Superior Man is likely to be tricked.
Ritsema/Karcher: Small People avail-of Invigorating. A chun tzu: absence
indeed. Cleary (2): Petty people use power; superior people disappear. Wu: A
little man deploys strength indiscreetly, but a jun zi does not.

Legge: Line three is dynamic, and in his proper place at the top of the trigram of
Strength. An inferior man so placed will use all of his strength to the utmost. Not
so the superior man. For him the position is beyond the safe middle, and he will
be cautious not to injure himself like the ram by exerting all of his strength.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The situation becomes entangled and perilous. The inferior man in power
applies full force and gets himself irretrievably enmeshed. He is like a goat
34 -- Great Power -- 34

butting against a hedge and getting its horns entangled. The superior man
renounces empty display of force and retains the secure middle position.

Wing: Only inferior people boast of their power or demonstrate it ostentatiously.
This creates many unnecessary entanglements and, ultimately, danger. Do not
persist in this. Concealed power, at this time, has the greatest effect.

Editor: The image suggests the difference between forcing an issue and allowing
it to develop naturally.

"Good fortune, evil fortune, occasion for repentance, and reason for
regret all arise from activity." Alas! Good fortune is only one out of four.
Should we not be careful about activity?
Chou Tun-I

A. Forcing the issue only ends in impasse.

B. "Don't push the river."

C. Relax! Contrived effort spoils the Work.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows a case in which firm correctness leads to
good fortune, and occasion for repentance disappears. We see the fence opened
without the horns being entangled. The strength is like the wheel spokes of a
large wagon.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears.
The hedge opens; there is no entanglement. Power depends upon the axle of a big
cart.

Blofeld: Righteous persistence brings good fortune and regret vanishes. The
hedge falls apart and he is no longer entangled. There is great power in the cart
axle. [A powerful axle indicates that the time is favorable for an advance
towards our goal.]

Liu: Persistence brings good fortune and remorse vanishes. The hedge opens
and entanglements vanish. Powerful is the axle of the big cart. [Note: Activity
will follow a long quiet period, bringing good fortune for the individual.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant. Repenting extinguished. The hedge
broken-up, not ruined. Invigorating tending-towards the Great: a cart's axle-
straps.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious; regret is gone. The fence block is
not weakened, but is matured by the great cart's axle-strut.

Cleary (1): Correctness is good; regret vanishes. The fence opened up, one does
not get stuck; power is in the axle of a large vehicle.

Cleary (2): Being correct leads to good results; regret vanishes. Fences opened
up, one does not get exhausted, etc.

Wu: With perseverance, there is good fortune and no regret. The fence has been
removed and the horns unharmed. The wooden pieces holding the axle
underneath the carriage are strong.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He still advances. Wilhelm/Baynes: It can go upward.
Blofeld: Once the hedge has fallen apart, he can get up and go forward.
Ritsema/Karcher: The hedge broken-up, not ruined. Honoring going indeed.
Cleary (2): It is valuable to go. Wu: The conditions are favorable to proceed.

Legge: Line four is still dynamic, but in the place of a magnetic line. This
explains the cautions with which the symbolism commences. Going forward thus
cautiously, his strength will produce the good effects described.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man removes all obstacles through quiet perseverance. Unseen power
can move heavy loads.

Wing: When you can work toward your aim and make progress without a great
show of power, you create a striking effect. Obstacles give way and your inner
strength persists. Good fortune.

Editor: The image suggests that slowly but surely, one step at a time, one
removes the obstacles to progress. Power thus accumulated can go anywhere.

The image of the thirty spokes converging toward the empty space of the
hub is often used to symbolize the virtue of the ruler who attracts all
creatures to his service, the virtue of Sovereign Unity that brings order to
the multiplicity of things around it.
M. Kaltenmark -- Lao Tzu and Taoism

A. Take it slow and the way becomes clear.

B. Willpower removes the obstacles to advancement.

C. Image of a careful, methodical advance.
34 -- Great Power -- 34
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows one who loses her ram-like strength
in the ease of her position. There will be no occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Loses the goat with ease. No remorse. [The place is strong,
it is in fact the place of the prince, but the nature of the line is yielding, hence the
outer place does not correspond with the inner nature. Therefore the line easily
rids itself of its obstinate disposition.]

Blofeld: He sacrifices a goat too lightly -- no regret! [I.e. he resorts too easily to
force, which is not advisable.]

Liu: He carelessly loses the goat. No remorse. [One is not able to achieve one's
plans; no benefit.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Losing the goat, tending-toward versatility. Without
repenting. [Versatility, I: sudden and unpredictable change; mental mobility
and openness; easy and light, not difficult and heavy; occurs in name of the I
Ching.]

Shaughnessy: Losing sheep at Yi; there is no regret.

Cleary (1): Losing the goat in ease, let there be no regret. [Even if people can’t
be vigorous, it would be fortunate if they opened their minds with flexible
receptivity and borrowed knowledge from others to break through their own
obstructions.]

Cleary (2): Losing the ram in ease, etc. [When one is flexible and balanced,
there is no attitude of rambunctious strength, so there is no regret.]

Wu: A sheep is lost in the field, etc.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She loses her ram and hardly perceives it -- she is not in her
proper place. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because the place is not the appropriate one.
Blofeld: This is indicated by the line's unsuitable position. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Situation not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): “The position is not appropriate”
means that one is as though master of the world but does not have anything to do
with it. Wu: Because the position is not proper.

Legge: Line five is magnetic in a central place and will therefore refrain from
exerting her strength. Although the hexagram does not forbid the use of
strength, it does concern itself with how strength should be properly controlled
and directed. All that is said about her is that she will give no occasion for
34 -- Great Power -- 34

repentance. Being "out of place" only means that the position properly requires a
dynamic line.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man has lost his alertness and strength because of the ease of his
position.

Wing: You should now let go of an opinionated or stubborn attitude. It is no
longer necessary to prove anything. The situation will progress with ease;
therefore you do not need to use excessive force.

Anthony: We may give up pacts with ourself which require people to do certain
things before we will be receptive to them. We need to allow ourself to be led, not
setting up structured ideas of how things must happen. We should give up anger
and feelings of retribution. Punishment must not be an end in itself.

Editor: None of the translations of this line convey exactly the same message in
English. When that happens, beware: the statement can have a maddeningly
koan-like range of meanings. In the positive sense, because line five occupies the
central place there is the possibility that one understands the Mean and knows
when to refrain from action: one "loses the goat (impetus to act) with ease."
Alternately, the Blofeld, Liu and Ritsema/Karcher versions depict power which is
misused or wasted. As a weak line in a strong place in a hexagram of strength
and action, this can also refer to an impotent force with little power to affect the
situation at hand. Since "no remorse" is involved, apparently no harm accrues.

Strength may be good or it may be evil. The same is true of weakness.
The ideal is the Mean.
Chou Tun-I

A. You can easily discard your compulsion to act.

B. An inferior force is eliminated from the situation.

C. Moderation prevents an excessive response.

D. When you are truly centered in the Work, aggressive action should be
unnecessary.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows one who may be compared to the ram
butting against the fence, and unable either to retreat, or to advance as he would
fain do. There will be no advantage in any respect, but if he realizes the difficulty
of his position, there will be good fortune.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Wilhelm/Baynes: A goat butts against a hedge. It cannot go backward, it
cannot go forward. Nothing serves to further. If one notes the difficulty, this
brings good fortune.

Blofeld: A goat butts against a hedge and can move neither backward nor
forward; it can get nowhere. Yet at this time, difficulty presages good fortune. ["It
can get nowhere" is a rendering of a phrase which, taken symbolically, means
that this is not a time to advance towards our goal or destination. The
implication of the last two sentences is that the shame we feel at finding
ourselves prisoners of circumstances will drive us to make an effort powerful
enough to release us.]

Liu: A goat butts against the hedge. It cannot advance or retreat; nothing
furthers. If one continues to work through the difficulty, there is good fortune. [If
you get this line, cease all arrogant behavior, otherwise it will cause you
trouble.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The he goat butts a hedge. Not enabling withdrawing, not
enabling releasing. Without direction: Harvesting. Drudgery by-consequence
significant. [Without direction: Harvesting: WU YU Li: no plan or
direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not
impose a direction on events.]

Shaughnessy: A ram butts a fence, is not able to retreat and is not able to
follow; there is no place beneficial; difficult but then auspicious.

Cleary (1): The ram running into a fence cannot retreat, cannot go ahead; there
is no benefit. Struggle will produce good results.

Cleary (2): ... Work hard and there will be good results.

Wu: A ram butts into a fence. He cannot go forward or back away. There is
nothing to gain. Endurance will bring good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The impasse is owing to his want of care. If he realizes his
difficulty his error will not be prolonged. Wilhelm/Baynes: "it cannot go
backward, it cannot go forward." This does not bring luck. The mistake is not
lasting. Blofeld: Inability to retire or advance is hardly conducive to good
fortune; but our very difficulties will generate it; the ignoble circumstances in
which we find ourselves will not endure for long. Ritsema/ Karcher: Not
ruminating indeed. Fault not long-living indeed. Cleary (2): Inability to retreat
or go ahead is due to carelessness. Work hard and there will be good results
because error will not increase. Wu: The situation is not good. The debacle will
not last.
34 -- Great Power -- 34

Legge: Line six, at the top of the trigram of Movement in the hexagram of Great
Power, may be expected to be dynamic in the exertion of strength. Because of
his passivity, the result is as described. If he stops pushing his cause and reflects
upon his weak position, good fortune will result.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man goes too far and reaches a deadlock with neither the capability to
advance nor the opportunity to retreat. If he recognizes his weakness and is not
obstinate, he will not compound the error.

Wing: You have gone so far in the pursuit of your desires that you are at an
impasse. Everything you try to do just complicates the situation even further.
Seeing the difficulty of this will eventually force you to compose yourself. The
entire affair can then be resolved.

Editor: The image suggests an impasse which can only be surmounted by
waiting patiently for its natural resolution. The second clause suggests that
circumstances will improve if you just don't meddle with them. Ritsema/
Karcher’s: "In order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a
direction on events" is usually the best choice whenever it is received in a line.

The path out of the dilemma can only be found by waiting and
consciously holding on to both sides of the conflict, by making the utmost
effort to keep both sides in fullest possible awareness without repressing
them or falling into a state of identification. This means nothing less
than that the conflict with all its excruciating implications must be
endured consciously; we cannot seek to terminate it forcibly by taking
sides, by enforcing a premature decision. Symbolically this amounts to a
crucifixion; by our consent, our acceptance of this suffering, we are
nailed to the cross of the opposing drives. We keep the apparent evil in
full sight and continue to wait for a way that allows us to express its
energy in constructive rather than destructive ways, though this may
seem impossible at the moment, both in terms of morality and of existing
reality.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Accept an impasse and learn its lesson.

B. “In order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction

HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-FIVE --
ADVANCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

Other titles: Progress, Prospering, The Symbol of Forwardness, To Advance,
Advancement, Making Headway, Getting the Idea, “Comes the Dawn”

Judgment

Legge: In Advance of Consciousness we see a prince who secures the
tranquility of the people presented on that account with numerous horses by the
king, and three times in a day received at interviews.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Progress. The powerful prince is honored with horses in
large numbers. In a single day he is granted audience three times.

Blofeld: Progress. The richly endowed prince receives royal favors in the form
of numerous steeds and is granted audience three times in a single day. [This
passage indicates great merit richly rewarded.]

Liu: The Marquis K'ang (rich, powerful, healthy) is bestowed with many
horses by the king, who receives him three times in a single day.

Ritsema/Karcher: Prospering, the calm feudatory avails-of bestowing
horses to multiply the multitudes. Day-time sun three-times reflected. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of thriving in the full light of the
sun. It emphasizes that contributing to this increase by helping things to
flourish is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: The Lord of Kang is herewith awarded horses in luxuriant
number, during daylight thrice connecting.

Cleary (1): Advancing, a securely established lord presents many horses, and
grants audience three times a day.

Cleary (2): Advancing, a securely established lord is presented with, etc.

Wu: Advancement indicates that the prince who has secured peace and
prosperity of the state is conferred with many fine horses. The king grants him an
audience three times in one day.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

The Image

Legge: The image of the earth and that of the bright sun coming forth above it
form Advance of Consciousness. The superior man, in accordance with this,
gives himself to make more brilliant his bright virtue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The sun rises over the earth: the image of Progress. Thus
the superior man himself brightens his bright virtue.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire blazing from the earth. The Superior
Man reflects in his person the glory of heaven's virtue.

Liu: The sun rising above the earth is the symbol of Progress. Thus the
superior man brightens his character.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness issuing-forth above earth. Prospering. A chun
tzu uses originating enlightening to brighten actualizing-tao. [Actualize-tao:
...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos...
Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Light emerges over the earth, advancing. Thus do superior people
by themselves illumine the quality of enlightenment.

Cleary (2): Light emerges over the ground, advancing. Developed people
illumine the quality of enlightenment by themselves.

Wu: Brightness rises above the earth; this is Advancement. Thus the jun zi
keeps his bright virtue shining.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Advance of Consciousness we have the bright sun
appearing above the earth; the symbol of Docile Submission cleaving to that of
the Great Brightness; and the magnetic line advanced and moving above: all
these things give us the idea of a prince who secures the tranquility of the people.

Legge: The subject of the Judgment is a feudal prince whose services to his
country have made him acceptable to his king. The King's favor has been shown
to him by gifts and personal attentions. The symbolism of the lines indicates the
situations encountered by the prince. The written character for this hexagram
means "to advance," a quality it shares with hexagrams number forty-six,
Pushing Upward, and number fifty-three, Gradual Progress. In the
present case the sun ascending from the earth to the meridian readily suggests
the idea of advancing.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

Hu Ping-wen (Yuan dynasty) says: "Of the strong things there is none so
strong as Heaven, and hence the superior man patterns himself on its strength.
Of bright things there is none so bright as the sun, and he patterns himself on its
brightness."

Anthony: This hexagram concerns self-development which yields progress in
our external life situation. If we are not making progress, we should review our
attitude. Some widely accepted ideas may be decadent from the viewpoint of the
Sage, hence obstruct progress. [Anthony’s “Sage” is conceptually identical to the
“Self. -- Ed.]

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: When the autonomous manifestations of our inner drives are
channeled, their energy becomes the ego's own. (Psychologically interpreted: Ego
and Self are in accord.)

The Superior Man focuses his awareness on perfecting the Work. (Sometimes
this can take the meaning of: "Wise up!")

The trigram of Clarity in progression over that of Docility gives the
formula for an Advance of Consciousness. The submission of the ego to the
restrictions of the Work, and the consequent tranquil subjugation of one's
restless drives, appetites and impulses, eventually results in a focused flow of
energy from within. (After years of effort, this is sometimes felt physically as a
radiating sensation emanating from the chest, or heart region.) To receive this
figure without changing lines does not necessarily mean that one has reached this
phase of the Work, but it suggests progress in that direction. The traditional
name for this hexagram is, in fact: Progress.

The king presenting horses to the prince in reward for pacifying the
kingdom is analogous to the Self rewarding the ego for controlling the
autonomous forces within the psyche. This is a quintessentially shamanic
discipline: the "horses" symbolize tamed drives and emotions. Such
circumstances indicate an Advance of Consciousness or progression toward
the goal of "en-light-enment" or psychic integration, symbolized by the sun
traversing the earth.

That state of life dynamism in which consciousness realizes itself as a
split and separated personality that yearns and strives toward union
with its unknown and unknowable partner, the Self, Jung has called the
individuation process. It is a conscious striving for becoming what one
"is" or rather "is meant to be."
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

The last sentence of the above quotation is exactly analogous to the
Ritsema/Karcher translation of the Image of this hexagram, wherein the superior
man (chun tzu) "uses originating enlightening to brighten actualizing-tao."

"Actualizing-tao" is the "ability to follow the course traced by the
ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which
makes a being become what it is meant to be."

Psychologically interpreted then, this hexagram addresses various themes
encountered during the progress of the individuation process, which is nothing if
not an Advance of Consciousness.

The key phrase in Legge's Judgment is "tranquility of the people." It is
relatively easy to sublimate one's drives, yet still feel resentful about it -- indeed,
that is the form that the process normally takes at the beginning of the Work. Our
inner forces are like children or animals who must learn to accept the restrictions
of discipline. Once they have accepted it and have ceased to resent it (i.e. once
they have become "tranquil"), they are ready to be useful to the Self's intentions.

For example: an untrained dog will instinctively chase and kill sheep
if it gets the chance to do so; on the other hand, a properly trained dog will herd
and control a flock of sheep even in its master's absence. Anyone who has
observed a trained sheep dog in action knows what amazing feats they
accomplish with great joy in the performance. They are "tranquil" in their role,
and will even protect the sheep from untrained dogs that would kill them. When
our instincts have learned how to tranquilly accept discipline they are ready to
assist us in the higher levels of the Work. Until that time, the Work consists
largely of "dog training." The analogy is apt, because just as an untrained dog is
never as happy in its willfulness as a well-trained dog is in its purposefulness, so
undisciplined permissiveness cannot compare with the joys of controlled power
and focused intent.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows one wishing to advance, and at the same
time kept back. Let her be firm and correct, and there will be good fortune. If
trust be not reposed in her, let her maintain a large and generous mind, and there
will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Progressing, but turned back. Perseverance brings good
fortune. If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm. No mistake.

Blofeld: Where progress seems likely to be cut short, righteous persistence
brings good fortune. To respond to lack of confidence with liberality entails no
error.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

Liu: When progress meets obstruction, persistence brings good fortune. If one
lacks the trust of others, one should remain benevolent. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Prospering thus, arresting thus. Trial: significant. Absence:
conforming. Enriching, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Aquatically, deeply; determination is auspicious; regret is gone.
Returning to the bath; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Advancing impeded, rectitude is good. Lacking confidence, become
fulfilled, and there will be no fault.

Cleary (2): Advancing, impeded, it bodes well to be correct. If there is no
trust, be easygoing, and there will be no blame.

Wu: It is like advancing and it is like turning back. Perseverance will bring good
fortune. People may not have confidence in him; if he can take it easy, he will
have no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: All alone she pursues the correct course. She has not yet
received an official charge. Wilhelm/Baynes: Solitary, she walks in the right.
Composure is not a mistake. One has not yet received the command. Blofeld:
Progress likely to be cut short refers to a single-handed attempt to do what is
right. Such liberality entails no blame where commands from the ruler have not
yet been received. [For purposes of divination, it can be taken to mean that we
can safely be generous even to people inclined to mistrust us, until those whom
we obey have given us a clear ruling in the matter.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Solitary moving correcting indeed. Enriching, without fault. Not-yet acquiescing-
in fate indeed. Cleary(2): One carries out what is right alone. Being easygoing,
without blame, is not accepting fate. Wu: He is right to advance alone. For he
has not received an official appointment.

Legge: Line one is magnetic and in the dynamic lowest position of Advance of
Consciousness. Her correlate fourth line is incorrectly dynamic in a magnetic
position. This indicates small and obstructed beginnings, but by her firm
correctness she pursues the way to good fortune. Though the ruler does not yet
have confidence in her, this only spurs her on to try harder to succeed.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man's desire to advance has not met with official
confidence. He should maintain a calm and generous attitude.

Wing: You are restrained from advancing because others lack confidence in you.
Do not try to force the situation and do not become angry. Remain calm and
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

behave with generosity and warmth. Put your attention into perfecting your work
and you will avoid regretful errors.

Editor: Psychologically, this line suggests a blockage somewhere within the
psyche, possibly due to your ignorance or misunderstanding of what the Work
requires now. If this is the only changing line, the figure created is hexagram 21,
Discrimination, with a corresponding line symbolizing an even greater
restriction. This implies the need to make some clarifying distinctions in the
matter at hand. Sort out your options and the way should become clear. "A large
and generous mind" is an open and receptive mind uninfluenced by limiting
beliefs; it is the opposite of "narrow-mindedness."

Every advance, every conceptual achievement of mankind, has been
connected with an advance of self-awareness: man differentiated
himself from the object and faced Nature as something distinct from her.
Any reorientation of psychological attitude will have to follow the same
road.
Jung -- The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche

A. Though some progress has been made, enlightenment in the matter at
hand has yet to be won. Relax, and keep plugging away -- sooner or later comes
the dawn.

B. Widen your horizons and the way becomes clear.

C. When held back or when mistrust prevails, maintain your objectivity,
don’t fret about it, and do what's right regardless.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject with the appearance of
advancing, and yet of being sorrowful. If she can be firm and correct, there will be
good fortune. She will receive great blessing from her grandmother. [Compare
this line and its situation with line two of Hexagram 62. – Ed.]

Wilhelm/Baynes: Progressing, but in sorrow. Perseverance brings good
fortune. Then one obtains great happiness from one's ancestress.

Blofeld: Where progress is being made sorrowfully, righteous persistence
brings good fortune. A little happiness is received, thanks to the Queen Mother.

Liu: When progress comes with sadness, persistence brings good fortune.
He receives good fortune from the Queen Mother.

Ritsema/Karcher: Prospering thus, apprehensive thus. Trial: significant.
Acquiescing-in closely-woven chain-mail: blessing. Tending-towards one's
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

kingly mother.

Shaughnessy: Aquatically, gloomily; determination is auspicious. Receiving
this strong good fortune from his royal mother.

Cleary (1): Advancing, grieving, rectitude is good; this great blessing is received
from the grandmother.

Wu: It is like advancing and it is like having concerns. Perseverance will bring
good fortune. He will receive a big fortune from his grandmother.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She will receive this great blessing because she is in the
central place and the correct position for her. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because of the
central and correct position. Blofeld: Happiness is implied by the position of
this line which is central to the lower trigram. Ritsema/Karcher: Using
centering correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Because of balance and rectitude. Wu:
“He will receive a big fortune,” because he is central and correct.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, as is her correlate line five; therefore she has to
mourn in obscurity. But her position is central and correct and she maintains the
momentum until eventual success is achieved. The Symbolism says she receives it
from her grandmother, and readers will be startled by the
extraordinary statement as I was when I first read it. Literally the text says "the
king's mother," but "king's father" and "king's mother" are well-known Chinese
appellations for "grandfather" and "grandmother." This is the view given on the
passage by Ch'eng-tzu, Chu Hsi and the K'ang-hsi editors. They all agree that the
name points us to line five, the correlate of two, and the ruler of the hexagram.
Line five is the sovereign who at length acknowledges the worth of the feudal
ruler, and gives her the great blessing. I am not sure that "motherly king" would
not be the best and fairest translation of the phrase. Canon McClatchie renders it
as "Imperial Mother" -- that is, the wife of Imperial Heaven (Juno) who occupies
the "throne" of the diagram, viz. the fifth line, which is soft and therefore
feminine. She is the Great Ancestress of the human race.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man appears to be advancing but is grieving because he is prevented
from making contacts with men in authority. His perseverance in adhering to
correct principles will be rewarded by blessings from the mild ruler.

Wing: Your Progress is not as fulfilling as it might be because you are
prevented from experiencing significant communication with someone in
authority. Yet, unexpected good fortune will come to you if you persevere in your
efforts and remain virtuous in your principles.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

Editor: There is puzzlement about the symbolism of the "grandmother" even
among the Chinese commentaries on this line. Our hypothesis is that, although
the symbolism emerging from the objective psyche takes different forms in
different cultures, it always describes the same general archetypes. We are
justified therefore in comparing this line with an analogous concept from the
Kabbalah: the sphere of awareness called Binah. Binah corresponds to the
Chinese notion of the primordial Yin -- the essence of the Feminine. Canon
McClatchie's association of "Juno, the wife of Imperial Heaven," to this line
could as well apply to Binah. In the Kabbalah, Binah is closely associated with
sorrow -- identical with "Our Lady of Sorrows" in Catholic Christian symbolism.
What is being conveyed in this line then, is the growth potential inherent in
adversity. Kabbalists may note similarities here with the symbolism of the 17th
Path of the Tree of Life.

Grief is a purgative and strongly disruptive force, and when the essential
work of breaking down adhesions and dispersing poisons has been done
by it, it gives place to a deep lassitude and feeling of emptiness which can
act as a purified basis for new growth. People are so made that they will
not or cannot realize a thing fully unless they are hit in the most vital
part in some deep emotional sense. And so only by sorrow, and by going
from sorrow to sorrow can an individual's evolution proceed. The man
who cannot or will not feel sorrow or face it in others cannot proceed at
all.
G. Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. A trail of tears leads to understanding.

B. Through adversity we acquire strength.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject trusted by all around her. All
occasion for repentance will disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: All are in accord. Remorse disappears.

Blofeld: All are in accord -- regret vanishes!

Liu: When the majority assents, remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Crowds, sincerity, repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: The masses are real; regret is gone.

Cleary(1): The group concurs; regret vanishes.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

Wu: There is consensus among many people. No regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Their common aim is to move upwards and act. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Because there is a will to go upward. Blofeld: This implies unanimous
determination to press upwards. Ritsema/Karcher: Moving above indeed.
Cleary(2): The aim is upward progress. Wu: A desire to advance.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place, but the first and second lines
share her desire to advance. They are all united by a common trust and aim,
hence the good auspice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man moves forward with the trust and support of all around him.

Wing: Your Progress is dependent upon the company and encouragement of
others. The benefits of this common trust will remove any cause for remorse.

Editor: This can be seen as a positive image of forces seeking synthesis.
Psychologically, the line suggests an inner unity of some kind -- thoughts and
feelings are in harmony and predisposed toward transformation.

No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's
consent.
Abraham Lincoln

A. The image suggests a cooperative advance.

B. You're on the right track.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject with the appearance of
advancing, but like a marmot. However firm and correct he may be, the position
is one of peril.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Progress like a hamster. Perseverance brings danger. [In
times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places to amass great
possessions. But such conduct shuns the light. And since times of progress are
also always times in which dubious procedures are inevitably brought to light,
perseverance in such action always leads to danger.]

Blofeld: Squirrel-like progress -- persistence would have serious consequences.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

Liu: When progress is like a hamster, to continue brings danger.

Ritsema/Karcher: Prospering, thus bushy-tailed rodents. Trial: adversity.
[Trial, CHEN: test by ordeal; inquiry by divination and its result... Adversity,
LI: danger; threatening, malevolent demon...]

Shaughnessy: Aquatically the mole cricket; determination is dangerous.

Cleary(1): Advancing like a squirrel, even if correct it is dangerous.

Cleary(2): Advancing like a squirrel is dangerous even if determined.

Wu: He makes advance like a giant rat. Even with correctness, he is in peril.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His place is not that appropriate for him. Wilhelm/
Baynes: A hamster gets into danger through perseverance; the place is not
appropriate. Blofeld: Because the position of this line is unsuitable.
Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): Because the
position is not appropriate. Wu: The giant rat is in peril despite making no error,
because his position is improper.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but in a magnetic place and not central. It suggests
the idea of a marmot or rat, stealthily advancing. Nothing could be more opposed
to the idea of the feudal lord in the hexagram.

Anthony: The ego is on hand at every situation, searching for glory, comfort and
a reason to exist, or finding cause for our abandoning the path. We must
constantly be on guard against its burrowing and amassing of possessions for
itself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man advances like a marmot. But such machinations are always
uncovered.

Wing: Progress is coming about through questionable means or inferior
persons. Although it is possible to advance this way, the truth will nevertheless
come to light. This is all very risky and you may find yourself in a dangerous
position.

Editor: Wilhelm adds the insight that rodents are nocturnal animals, and
because line four has just entered the upper trigram of Clarity and Light, it is
exposed and vulnerable. Blofeld suggests one who tries to progress too quickly
and thereby exposes himself to danger. The image is that of a mouse scurrying
along a wall, trying to reach the safety of its hole before the cat can pounce. This
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

is "progress" of a sort, but hardly something to be desired. The line is often
received as a warning about restlessness and anxiety. Such impatience to advance
leads to Splitting Apart, which is the hexagram created if this is the only
changing line. Sometimes this can be a warning about the malicious intentions of
others.

All human error is impatience, a premature renunciation of method, a
delusive pinning down of a delusion.
Franz Kafka

A. Impatience or anxiety have placed you in jeopardy.

B. Dark forces push into the light -- unconscious elements enter awareness
and threaten the Work.

C. The line can sometimes refer to compulsive speculation.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows how all occasion for repentance
disappears from its subject. But let her not concern herself about whether she
shall fail or succeed. To advance will be fortunate, and in every way
advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse disappears. Take not gain and loss to heart.
Undertakings bring good fortune. Everything serves to further.

Blofeld: Regret vanishes. Care not for loss or gain. To seek some goal or
destination now would bring good fortune; everything is favorable.

Liu: Remorse vanishes. One should not mind gain or loss. To act brings good
fortune and benefit in everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished. Letting-go, acquiring, no cares.
Going significant, without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone. The arrow is gotten; do not pity; going is
auspicious; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): Regret vanishes. Loss or gain, don’t worry. It is good to go:
everything will benefit.

Cleary (2): ... Don’t worry about loss of gains, etc.

Wu: There will be no regret. He is not concerned with either gains or losses.
To advance is auspicious. Nothing is disadvantageous.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her movement in advance will afford ground for
congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes: Undertaking brings blessing. Blofeld: If,
without regard for loss or gain, we just press forward, our actions will be blessed.
Ritsema/Karcher: Going possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): If you go,
there will be joy. Wu: To advance has much to celebrate.

Legge: In line five the ruler of the hexagram and her intelligent sovereign meet
happily. She holds on her right course, indifferent as to results, but things are so
ordered that she is, and will continue to be, crowned with success.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man occupies an influential position with the intelligent sovereign. He
remains gentle and reserved in his dealings. Let him not reproach himself for not
obtaining all possible gains or regretfully take failures to heart. His beneficent
influence will eventually be crowned with success.

Wing: It is wise now to act with gentleness, reserve, and moderation regardless
of the fact that you are in a position of great influence. Do not think about the
gains you might make or the possible setbacks that could befall you. Continue in
righteous Progress and you will be blessed by good fortune.

Editor: The magnetic, yielding ruler suggests an ego yielding to the demands of
the Work -- accepting what comes rather than trying to influence the situation
through ego-centric conceptions of progress. There is a definite suggestion here
of influences operating outside of awareness.

Through hearing, understanding, and wisdom, one should so
comprehend the nature of all things as not to fall into the error of
regarding matter and phenomena as real.
"Precepts of the Gurus," Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines

A. Action is taken for its own sake to effect an unknown purpose. Progress
isn't dependent upon external appearances.

B. Profit and loss are illusions -- bear your burden with a smile.

C. "Don't worry, be happy!" Everything is proceeding according to plan.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows one advancing his horns. But he only
uses them to punish the rebellious people in his own city. The position is perilous,
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35

but there will be good fortune. Yet, however firm and correct he may be, there
will be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Making progress with the horns is permissible only for the
purpose of punishing one's own city. To be conscious of danger brings good
fortune. No blame. Perseverance brings humiliation.

Blofeld: He advances as with lowered horns, intent solely upon subduing the
cities of his enemies. Whether his affairs go awry or prosper, he is not in error,
but for him to persist thus would involve him in ignominy

Liu: Progressing to the horns. It is only in order to chastise his own city.
Awareness of danger brings fortune and no blame. To continue brings
humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Prospering: one's horns. Holding-fast avails-of subjugating
the capital. Adversity significant, without fault. Trial: abashment.

Shaughnessy: Aquatic his horns; it is only to be used to attack the city; danger;
auspicious; there is no trouble; determination is distressful.

Cleary (1): Advancing the horns; this requires conquering one’s domain.
There is danger, but it bodes well, so there will be no blame. But even though
correct it is humiliating.

Cleary (2): ... Hard work leads to good results, without blame; but even though
correct, one is humiliated. [Since one was unable to govern oneself early on, and
only now has been capable of self-mastery, even though it is correct, it is still
humiliating.]

Wu: He advances with his horns to quell disturbances of his town. Although he
makes a risky move, he is not in error. His insistence is nevertheless regrettable.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His course of procedure is not yet brilliant. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The way is not yet in the light. Blofeld: Solely to subdue the cities? The
way is not yet clear! Ritsema/Karcher: Tao not-yet shining indeed. Cleary
(2): The way is not yet illumined. Wu: His administration is not beyond
reproach. [If he had done things right, there would have been no disturbances.]

Legge: Line six is dynamic, and suggests the idea of its subject relentlessly
pushing his advance with both firm correctness and exceptional force. The horns
are an emblem of threatening strength, and though he uses them only against the
rebels in his own state, the fact that a prince should have any occasion to use
force is regrettable. This aggressiveness exceeds King Wen's concept of firm
correctness for a ruler, and therefore his light is not yet that of the full-orbed sun.
35 -- Advance of Consciousness -- 35
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man uses force in punishing the rebellious people of his own city. This
is permissible. Continuation of the offensive, especially against strangers,
however, will bring occasion for regret.

Wing: Take aggressive and offensive measures only when you seek to discipline
yourself. Such severe precautions will help you to avoid regretful errors. Do not,
however, make the mistake of using the same force on others or you will suffer
the humiliation of alienation and failure.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the City symbolizes the psyche, and the
rebels symbolize any undisciplined emotions, drives, desires, appetites, thoughts,
etc. The Judgment specifically mentions the importance of gaining the
tranquility of the people; here they are obviously not tranquil, so the idea of the
hexagram has not been accomplished. Although force is required to stabilize the
situation, martial law can hardly be regarded as anything but a temporary
expedient: however necessary it may be at times, it is still humiliating for a ruler
(ego) to have to resort to it. The line often refers to backsliding on some issue.

The possibility of choice and relationship depends fundamentally upon
getting out of this state of identity. As long as this unconscious identity
with a drive or impulse persists there is no possibility of choice, for we act
like helpless puppets and we never know what strings have pulled us.
There is no possibility for any personal conscious relatedness because
neither of two people who are identical with their impulses knows what is
moving him or what, if anything, this has to do with the other person.
Separation from the original state of identity is fundamental for any
psychological development and for personal differentiation.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Control yourself. Discipline must be applied to the restless aspects
within your own psyche. Do nothing to try to influence others.

sounds, may just mean being restricted or restricting yourself." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Under the conditions of Clouded Perception be aware of the difficulty
of your position and maintain firm correctness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Darkening of the Light. In adversity it furthers one to be
persevering.

Blofeld: Darkening of the Light. Righteous persistence in the face of
difficulty brings reward.

Liu: Darkening of the Light. It benefits one to carry on through hard times.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness Hiding, Harvesting: drudgery, Trial. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of intelligence hidden or harmed. It
emphasizes that deliberately concealing your light by entering what is beneath
you is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told
to: hide your brightness!]

Shaughnessy: Calling pheasant: Beneficial to determine about difficulty.

Cleary (1): In concealment of illumination, it is beneficial to be upright in
difficulty.

Cleary (2): When illumination is damaged, it is beneficial to be upright in
difficulty.

Wu: Light Obliterated indicates that it is advantageous to be persevering in
time of danger.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

The Image

Legge: The sun enters the earth -- the image of Clouded Perception. The
superior man manages his subordinates and shows his intelligence by keeping it
hidden.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The light has sunk into the earth: the image of Darkening
of the Light. Thus does the superior man live with the great mass: He veils his
light, yet still shines.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes light hidden within the earth. In governing
the people, the Superior Man, though taking care to conceal his light,
nevertheless shines.

Liu: The sun sinking under the earth symbolizes the Darkening of the Light.
In approaching the people the superior man veils his brightness, yet still has
glory.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness entering earth center. Brightness Hiding. A
chun tzu uses supervising the crowds to avail-of darkening and-also Brightening.

Cleary (1): Light enters into the earth, illumination is concealed. Thus do
Superior people deal with the masses, acting unobtrusively while in fact
illuminated. [When practitioners of the Tao are among the masses, if they use
their illumination too much, they will startle the ignorant and amaze the
worldly, easily bringing on abuse and slander.]

Cleary (2): Illumination goes underground, in concealment of
illumination. In dealing with the masses, true leaders act unobtrusively while
in fact being illuminated. [What sages learn is to become daily more illumined
unbeknownst to others.]

Wu: The light enters the earth; this is Light Obliterated. Thus the jun zi uses
the spirit of dimness in place of brightness to administer affairs of the
populace. [By “dimming” his internal strength, he would make people feel that
he is one of them.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The image of Brightness entering into the midst of the earth
suggests clarity that has been wounded or obscured. The lower trigram shows
Clarity, the upper Docility. King Wen had both of these qualities, yet he was
involved in great difficulties. The individual concerned should obscure his
brightness. Thus was Count Chi able to correctly maintain his mind and intent
amidst the difficulties of his situation.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Legge: This hexagram shows an able officer going forth in the service of his
country, notwithstanding the occupancy of the throne by a weak and
unsympathetic ruler. Hence the name Clouded Perception or Intelligence
Wounded -- that is, injured and oppressed. The lesson of the figure is to show
how such an officer will conduct himself and maintain his purpose.

King Wen was not of the line of Shang. Though opposed and persecuted
by its sovereign, he could pursue his own course, till his line came in the end to
supersede the other. It could not be so with the Count of Chi, who was a member
of the House of Shang. He could do nothing that would help on its downfall.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Recognize a difficult situation and use your willpower to cope with
its restrictions.

The Superior Man manages the situation by subduing his need to speculate,
meddle, or call attention to himself. (Alternate: When in the presence of
arrogance, the wise man plays the fool.)

The thirty-fifth hexagram shows the trigram of Clarity progressing over
the earth -- an image of advancing awareness. The thirty-sixth hexagram is the
inverse of this -- it shows the trigram of Clarity swallowed up by the earth. If the
image of Advance of Consciousness symbolizes noon, when the sun is at the
midheaven, then Clouded Perception symbolizes midnight, when the sun is at
the Imum Coeli, or undersky. It is a time of maximum darkness, maximum
ignorance; a time when the dark forces of the unconscious are at their strongest.
We are reminded of the Dark Night of the Soul, an inescapable and inevitable
phase of the Work:

When, at length, they have practiced themselves for some time in the
journey of virtue, persevering in meditation and prayer, wherein, with
the suavity and relish they have found, they have become detached from
worldly things, and acquired some spiritual strength in God, so as to be
able to curb the creature appetites and in some small degree suffer for
God some slight load and dryness, without turning back at the crucial
moment; when, to their thinking, they are proceeding in these spiritual
exercises to their entire satisfaction and delight; and when the Sun of
Divine favors seems to them to shine most radiantly upon them, God
darkens all this light, and shuts the door and fountain of the sweet
spiritual water, which they were wont to drink in God as often and as
long as they chose ... and thus, he leaves them in darkness so profound
that they know not whither to direct the sense of the imagination and
speculations of the mind.
St. John of the Cross

36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

The Dark Night of the Soul is the universal experience of everyone who
follows the way beyond the tried and true paths of the spiritual dilettante. It is an
archetypal filter for determining the survival of the fittest in psychic evolution.
For those who have entered this phase of the Work, it is good to remember that
no one is given a test that they can't pass if they sincerely want to.

The situation in line five of this hexagram means little to one who is
unacquainted with Chinese history. In its essence, the story of Count Chi
concerns a superior man who was imprisoned by an evil emperor. The only way
that he could survive this dark time was to feign insanity. Thus the message in
the Image counsels us to show our intelligence by concealing it. There is a wide
range of applications for this rule, and perhaps Lao Tse gives us the best
paraphrase of the idea in his famous aphorism: He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.

In terms of the Work this can mean that one must firmly understand that
there are some things which cannot be shared with just anyone. Inner work is
very fragile until it has had time to crystallize, and to expose its truths to the
harsh light of unsophisticated intellect is to risk severe damage
to the process of individuation.

One must not tell people of things they cannot grasp. There are mysteries
that cannot be shared with everybody ... Some things can be told to no
one and a secret told to a wrong person is destructive and even
irresponsible.
M.L. Von Franz -- The Feminine in Fairytales

This hexagram can symbolize many situations, but sometimes it is a
suggestion that you are ignorant or "in the dark" about the true state of affairs
now prevailing.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject with clouded perception, flying,
but with drooping wings. When the superior man is about his business he may go
for three days without eating. Wherever he goes, the people there may speak
derisively of him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Darkening of the light during flight. He lowers his wings.
The superior man does not eat for three days on his wanderings. But he has
somewhere to go. The host has occasion to gossip about him.

Blofeld: Failure of the light during his progress through the sky caused him to
lower his wings. When busy with affairs, the Superior Man may go without food
for three days on end, so intent is he on reaching his goal; but his lord will have
something to say about this.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Liu: The darkened light flies and droops its wings. The superior man fasts for
three days during his wanderings. His host speaks of him with derision. He leaves
to go someplace.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness Hiding tending-towards flying. Drooping one's
wings. A chun tzu tending-towards moving: three days not taking in. Possessing
directed going. A lord: people possessing words.

Shaughnessy: The calling pheasant in flight, drops its left wing: the gentleman
on the move, for three days does not eat; there is someplace to go; the ruler has
words.

Cleary (1): Concealing illumination in flight, letting the wings hang down; a
superior man on a journey not eating for three days has a place to go. The
master is criticized.

Cleary (2): Illumination concealed in flight, etc ... The ruler has something to
say.

Wu: It is like a bird in flight with its wings drooping. If the jun zi takes a journey,
he may go without food for three days and his host will have words about his
undertakings.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In such a case he feels it right not to eat. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It is the obligation of the superior man to refrain from eating during his
wanderings. Blofeld: It is the duty of the Superior Man to go without food for
three days if his activities require this of him. Ritsema/Karcher: A chun tzu
tending-towards moving: righteously not taking-in indeed. Cleary (2): It is right
that they do not eat. [This is like a just person fleeing a vicious tyrant ... such is
the speed of travel that they do not have the leisure to eat for three days.] Wu:
For righteousness sake, he refuses to eat.]

Legge: Line one is dynamic, and in its right place. He should be going forward,
but the general signification of the hexagram supposes him to be wounded. The
wound, received at the commencement of the action, is but slight. It suggests a
bird hurt so that it must droop its wings. The subject then appears directly as the
superior man. He understands that he must desist from the struggle for a time,
and is so rapt in the thought that he can fast for three days and not think of it.
When he does withdraw, opposition may follow him, but he holds to his own
purpose. The commentary says that he does not purposely fast, but when he has
nothing to eat he doesn't complain. He thinks it right that it should be so in this
case.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man encounters hostility and derision in his attempt to
soar above all obstacles. He does not compromise but perseveres in his thinking
and remains true to his principles. People do not understand him.

Wing: An attempt to rise above the obstacles in your environment will be
met with hostility. If you decide to serve your personal drives and compromise
the needs of society, you will be misunderstood and censured. Such is the
difficulty of the position.

Editor: Flying: Air is the realm of thought. To fly is to move in the realm of
ideas: to think, speculate, reason. Drooping wings: Wounded in the realm of
thought: impaired thinking, inferior conceptualization, crippled by faulty ideas or
incomplete information, “clipped wings.” He does not eat: he doesn't jump to
conclusions, but reasons it out to the end. Three days: A period of completion.
("The Chinese say that numbers begin at one and are made perfect at three." --
Gaskell, Dictionary of Scriptures and Myths.) People speak derisively:
Subordinate elements within the psyche (emotions, etc.) clamor for resolution,
easy answers, etc. Psychologically, this combination of symbols points to a
confused situation which demands careful differentiation. Though answers may
not be forthcoming immediately, be patient and you will get what you seek. The
line can also refer to painfully following one's path regardless of consequences.
(Compare with symbolism of fourth line correlate.)

In a word: the first work of the hero is to retreat from the world scene of
secondary effects to those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties
really reside, and there to clarify the difficulties, eradicate them in his
own case (i.e., give battle to the nursery demons of his local culture) and
break through to the undistorted direct experience and assimilation of
what C.G. Jung has called "the archetypal images." This is the process
known to Hindu and Buddhist philosophy as viveka, "discrimination."
Joseph Campbell -- The Hero with a Thousand Faces

A. Your thinking is confused and requires a new point of view. Don't jump
to easy conclusions. Even though you are anxious to resolve the issue, you are
obliged to reason it through to the end.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject with clouded perception and
wounded in the left thigh. She saves herself by the strength of a swift horse, and
is fortunate.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh. He
gives aid with the strength of a horse. Good fortune. [Here the Lord of
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Light is in a subordinate place and is wounded by the Lord of Darkness. But
the injury is not fatal; it is only a hindrance. Rescue is still possible.]

Blofeld: Though injured in the left thigh, he made use of a horse in relieving
distress -- good fortune!

Liu: The darkened light injures his left thigh, but he is saved by a strong horse.
Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness Hiding. Hiding tending-towards the left thigh.
Availing-of a rescuing horse, invigorating significant.

Shaughnessy: The calling pheasant is wounded in the left thigh; herewith hold
aloft the horse's vitality; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Concealment of illumination. Getting hurt in the left leg calls for
rescue; if the horse is strong, it bodes well.

Wu: His left thigh is wounded. There will be good fortune if a strong horse is
used to save him.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her good fortune is due to the proper fashion of her acting
according to her circumstances. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune comes
from [the line's] devotion to the rule. Blofeld: This good fortune results from
compliance with laws and regulations. [The implication would seem to be that,
when charged with emergency duties, we must persist in carrying them out at
all costs.] Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding used by-consequence indeed. [By-
consequence (-of), TSE: very strong connection, reason, cause, result; rule,
law, pattern, standard...] Cleary (2): The luck of the second yin is in model
obedience. Wu: Abiding by the principle.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, but in her proper and central place, giving us the
idea of an officer, obedient to duty and the right. Her wound in the left thigh may
impede her movements, but it does not disable her. She finds the means to save
herself and maintain her good purpose. The "proper fashion of acting" is
suggested by the magnetic line being the central place.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is injured but is not disabled. He recovers and pursues his good
purpose with the strength of a horse.

Wing: Rather than disabling you, a recent injury that you have sustained on your
path will serve to inspire you toward affirmative and vigorous action in the
direction of the general good.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Editor: The thigh is a walking muscle, giving us the power to move or act. The
left is a universal symbol of the unconscious psyche and its functions. The left
thigh, then, is an image of unconscious motive power, or natural motivation. To
be "wounded in the left thigh" suggests an impeded natural response, as opposed
to a conscious, willed response. (When associated with the idea of Clouded
Perception, this may refer to a failure of insight or intuition.) A horse
represents energy in general; here it may be psychic energy relating to perception
-- "horse- sense," if you will. One is reminded of the centaur Chiron, the
“wounded healer” of Greek myth, who was also wounded in the thigh. In
astrology, Chiron symbolizes unhealable wounds, and although it may be
stretching the symbolism here, dealing with such wounds is a natural part of the
Work: they may be unhealable, but they must be dealt with nonetheless. In the
words of an old Blues lyric: “I may get better, but I won’t get well.” Sometimes
receiving this line is a hint that if you were in touch with your inner processes you
wouldn't have needed to ask the question.

Fusion, inner unity, is obtained by means of "friction," by the struggle
between "yes" and "no" in man. If a man lives without inner struggle, if
everything happens to him without opposition, if he goes wherever he is
drawn or wherever the wind blows, he will remain such as he is. But if a
struggle begins in him, and particularly if there is a definite line in this
struggle, then, gradually, permanent traits begin to form themselves, he
begins to "crystallize."
Gurdjieff

A. Crippled by ignorance, but saved by instinct -- let horse-sense be your
guide.

B. A lack of awareness has crippled your ability to respond, but the
impetus of your innate sense of what is correct will carry you through.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject in the condition of clouded
perception, hunting in the south, and taking the great chief of the darkness. He
should not be eager to make all correct at once.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south. Their
great leader is captured. One must not expect perseverance too soon.

Blofeld: Wounded while on a military expedition in the south, he still managed
to capture the rebel leader. Persistence amounting to madness should be avoided.

Liu: The southern expedition of the darkened light captures the leader. Act
without rushing. Continue.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness Hiding tending-towards the South, hounding.
Acquiring its great, the head. Not permitting affliction. Trial.

Shaughnessy: The calling pheasant is wounded in the southern hunt, getting its
great head; it is not permissible to determine about illness.

Cleary (1): Illumination concealed, going south hunting, catching the big chief;
hasty correction won’t do.

Wu: A royal hunt in the southern country bags the head of the chieftains. It is
correct to go without haste.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: With the aim represented by hunting in the south a great
achievement is accomplished. Wilhelm/Baynes: The purpose of the hunt in
the south has great success. Blofeld: His willingness to undertake the expedition
to the south symbolizes determination to achieve great results. Ritsema/
Karcher: The South: hounding's purpose. Thereupon acquiring the great
indeed. Cleary (2): A big catch. Wu: The goal is to make big gains.

Legge: Line three, dynamic in a dynamic place, is the topmost line of the lower
trigram of Clarity. He responds to his proper correlate in line six, emblemed in
this hexagram as the seat of the weak tyrant. The solar light is found in the south,
to which we turn when we look at the sun at noon, and hence the subject of this
line is seen as a hunter successfully pursuing his quarry. Although successful he
should not be overeager to put all things right at once.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man encounters the chief of disorder and captures him. Despite swift
victory, he is not overly eager to put all things in order in one fell swoop. Only
gradualness is effective in correcting the long-standing evils.

Wing: You come face to face with the perpetrator of wrong thinking.
Circumstances are such that you can effortlessly seize control of the situation.
Proceed carefully. It is dangerous to attempt to abolish an old and ingrained
pattern all at once.

Editor: The south is where the light is found, and to hunt there is to seek
enlightenment in the matter at hand. To take the "great chief of the darkness" is
to apprehend the source of the problem. To "not be eager to make all correct at
once" can be a caution about imposing intellectual reasoning on emotional forces.
(Line 18-2 is similar in this respect.) In its most neutral interpretation, the line
suggests the comprehension of a problem.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Filling the conscious mind with ideal conceptions is a characteristic of
Western theosophy, but not the confrontation with the shadow and the
world of darkness. One does not become enlightened by imagining
figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.
Jung -- Alchemical Studies

A. To understand a problem is easier than to correct it. Don't expect
instant success.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject just entered into the left
side of the belly of the dark land. But she is able to carry out the mind appropriate
to the condition of clouded perception, quitting the gate and
courtyard of the lord of darkness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He penetrates the left side of the belly. One gets at the very
heart of the darkening of the light, and leaves the gate and courtyard.

Blofeld: It is as though he had penetrated someone's left side and perceived a
darkened heart as clearly as if that heart had been abstracted from its dwelling
place. [The Chinese text for this line is so far from clear as to suggest that it is
corrupt. My interpretation must be regarded as no more than an intelligent
guess. The actual text runs something like this: "Into left side, obtain light-
darkened heart -- or heart of the light-darkening -- outside the gates and
courtyards (of home)." Fortunately, the commentary on this line explains the
general meaning, so the matter is not of great importance.]

Liu: He penetrates the left belly (an inner place) and wins the heart (confidence)
of the darkened light. Then he gets the chance to fly away from the courtyard.

Ritsema/Karcher: Entering tending-towards the left belly. Catching
Brightness Hiding's heart. Tending-towards issuing- forth-from the gate
chambers.

Shaughnessy: The calling pheasant is wounded in the left belly: Bagging the
calling pheasant's heart, in going out of the gate and courtyard.

Cleary (1): Entering the left belly, finding the mind in which illumination is
concealed, one leaves the house.

Cleary (2): ... Finding the heart of illumination in concealment and going out of
the house.

Wu: He enters the left side of the trunk to get at the heart of Light Obliterated.
He leaves his house.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Having just entered into the left side of the belly of the dark
land, she is still able to carry out the idea in her mind. Wilhelm/Baynes: That
is, he finds out the inmost sentiment of the heart. Blofeld: This is a way of
saying that he saw clearly into the other's heart. Ritsema/Karcher: Entering
tending-towards the left belly. Catching the heart, intention indeed. Cleary (2):
Entering the left belly is finding the heart’s intent. Wu: For the purpose of
learning the intention. [“The left side of the trunk” suggests a darkened area,
referring euphemistically to the court of the tyrant king.]

Legge: Line four is magnetic, but in her proper place. She escapes from her
dangerous position with little damage. The "idea in her mind" is the idea of
withdrawing from the position and escaping.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is in close proximity to the leader of the evil forces. Knowing the
latter's secret thoughts, he recognizes that there is no hope for improvement. He
therefore leaves the scene before the disastrous storm.

Wing: You are in a fine position to perceive the present situation with clarity. If
it appears hopeless and doomed, as it well might, now is a good time to exit.

Editor: Left side: Universal symbol of the unconscious. Belly of the dark land:
The center of the unconscious, the source of ignorance, evil, etc. Carry out the
mind appropriate to the condition of clouded perception: i.e., the Judgment and
Image of the hexagram. Quitting the gate and courtyard of the lord of darkness:
Once you see the source of the problem, avoid it henceforth. This line is the
proper correlate of line one, which describes a difficult inquiry. In some
circumstances, the two lines might be thought of as a question and its answer.

The unconscious parts of the psyche are actually, as the term implies,
unknown -- a fact not infrequently overlooked, for it is hard for anyone
to believe that factors of which he knows nothing are functioning
autonomously within his own psyche. Even when their presence has been
demonstrated conclusively, it is often hard for the individual to admit
their existence even to himself.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. "Resist not evil" -- avoid it.

B. Clarify your ignorance by getting to the heart of the matter and then act
accordingly.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

C. You have comprehended an unpleasant truth which demands an
obvious and appropriate response.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows how the Count of Chi fulfilled the
condition indicated by clouded perception. It will be advantageous to be firm and
correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi. Perseverance
furthers.

Blofeld: Prince Chi suffered injury, but his persistence along a righteous course
was rewarded.

Liu: The darkened light of Prince Chi. Continuance benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: The winnowing son's Brightness Hiding. Harvesting Trial.

Shaughnessy: Jizi's calling pheasant; beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): Concealment of illumination in a basket is beneficial if correct.

Cleary (2): The concealment of illumination on the part of a just scion of an evil
ruling house is beneficial and upright.

Wu: The way the Viscount of Qi handled the situation of Light Obliterated is
advantageous only through perseverance.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His brightness could not be quite extinguished. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The perseverance of Prince Chi shows that the light cannot be
extinguished. Blofeld: His was a light which can never be extinguished.
Ritsema/Karcher: Brightness not permitted to pause indeed. Cleary (2): His
understanding cannot be suppressed. [This represents being outwardly flexible
while inwardly strong, remaining balanced in the middle, appearing to be
ignorant while actually being illuminated.] Wu: The perseverance of the
Viscount of Qi made it impossible to obliterate the light.

Legge: Line five should be the place of the ruler, but in this hexagram line six
takes that position. The officer here, in the center of the upper trigram, just
below the sovereign, is modeled on the Count of Chi, an historical personage.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man recalls the manner in which Prince Chi preserved his convictions
by feigning insanity when trapped in the court of the tyrant Chou Hsin. In coping
with danger during times of darkness, he exhibits an invincibility of spirit,
coupled with unusual caution.

Wing: You are in an obvious and important role in this situation, yet you are not
in accord with it. You are not in a position to struggle against elements that run
contrary to your principles. Conceal your ideals and acquiesce outwardly to the
powers that be. You will ultimately be rewarded.

Editor: Count Chi "hid his light" by feigning insanity to deceive the tyrant
holding him captive. Basically, the idea is that you are "imprisoned" by the
situation at hand and powerless to do anything but adapt to it. If you don't
surrender your integrity you can persevere through a dark and difficult time. As
so often in fifth lines, the image is an echo of the ideas in the Judgment and/or
Image of the hexagram as a whole. This particular predicament reminds us of the
Biblical story of David:

David ... became very frightened of Achish the king of Gath. When their
eyes were on him he played the madman and, when they held him,
feigned lunacy. He would drum on the doors of the gate and let his spittle
run down his beard. Achish said to his servants, "You can see this man is
mad. Why bring him to me? Have I not enough madmen without your
bringing me this one to weary me with his antics?"
I Samuel 21: 13--15:

A. In the presence of arrogance, the wise man plays the fool. (Now is the
time to hide your light.)

B. The Dark Night of the Soul.

C. Clarity in the matter at hand is concealed for now.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the case where there is no light, but only
obscurity. Its subject had at first ascended to the top of the sky; her future shall
be to go into the earth.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Not light but darkness. First he climbed up to heaven, then
he plunged into the depths of the earth.

Blofeld: Nothing to lighten the darkness! Having once climbed to heaven, he
later descended into the earth.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Liu: Not light, but shadows. First he ascended to the sky, and later plunged into
the earth.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not Brightening, darkening. Initially mounting tending-
towards heaven. Afterwards entering tending-towards earth.

Shaughnessy: Not bright or dark: initially it rises into the heavens, afterwards
it enters into the ground.

Cleary (1): The darkness of non-understanding; first ascending to heaven, then
descending into the earth.

Cleary (2): In the darkness of ignorance, first ascending to heaven, later going
underground.

Wu: Knowing not how to use the spirit of dimness, he first ascends to heaven
and then falls into the depths of the earth.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She might have enlightened the four quarters of the
kingdom. She has failed to fulfill the model of a ruler. Wilhelm/Baynes:
Thus he might have been able to illuminate the lands of all the four quarters of
the earth. Because he had lost the rule. Blofeld: He illumined the four quarters
of the empire; his descent into the earth means that he transgressed divine law.
Ritsema/Karcher: Illuminating the four cities indeed. Letting-go by
consequence indeed. Cleary (2): First ascending to heaven is lighting up the
nations; later going underground is losing guidance. Wu: “He first ascends to
heaven” when his brightness shines at the four corners of the kingdom, “and then
falls into the depths of the earth” when he violates the code of conduct.

Legge: Line six shows the fate of the ruler, who opposes the officer who would
do her good and intelligent service. Instead of becoming as the sun, enlightening
all from the height of the sky, she is as the sun hidden below the earth.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: There is only darkness. The ruler opposes officers capable of good and
intelligent service. He does not shower blessings upon his people but ignores his
duties and responsibilities for increasing the common good.

Wing: The current trend is coming to an end. The bad times are consuming
themselves and will become but a memory. Those who once struggled to control
the situation will fall back into obscurity.
36 -- Clouded Perception -- 36

Editor: This line is the Lord of Darkness oppressing the entire hexagram.
Psychologically interpreted, the ego has not seen the light. Because this line
changes the hexagram to number twenty-two, Persona, there is a hint that some
sort of egocentric vanity may be involved.

Hence it is that they shun the light of heaven, and cast themselves down
into their own light; a light which is like the light from glowing coals,
and in some places like that from burning sulphur. But even this light is
turned into thick darkness, when any particle of light from heaven flows
in there.
Swedenborg -- Heaven and Hell

A. You had clarity, then you lost it.

B. An image of the source of darkness, ignorance or negativity in the
situation at hand.

C. A negative element about to be eliminated.

37 -- The Family -- 37
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-SEVEN –
FAMILY

Other titles: Family Life, Clan, Home, Linkage, Dwelling People, The Psyche,
"May indicate a situation where the family can and should help." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: For the regulation of The Family, what is most advantageous is that the
wife be firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers.

Blofeld: The Family. Women's persistence brings reward.

Liu: The Family. A woman's perseverance benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dwelling People. Harvesting: woman Trial. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of living and working with others in
a common space. It emphasizes that caring for your relation with those who
share this space and for the space itself is the adequate way to handle it. To be in
accord with the time, you are told to: dwell with people!]

Shaughnessy: Family members: Beneficial for the maiden to determine.

Cleary (1): For people in the home it is beneficial that the woman be chaste.
[In the human body, the vitality, spirit, soul, psyche, and intent all belong to yin
and all take orders from the human mentality ... When you refine away the
human mind, the mind of tao spontaneously becomes manifest.]

Wu: The Family indicates that it is advantageous for a woman to be
persevering. [This is a hexagram with its emphasis on women. Both constituent
trigrams are feminine ... Hence those who endeavor to be firm and correct will
have advantages.]

The Image

Legge: Wind rising out of fire -- the image of The Family. The superior man
speaks the truth and is consistent in his behavior.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wind comes forth from fire: The image of The Family.
Thus the superior man has substance in his words and duration in his way of life.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind rising from fire. The Superior Man's
speech is full of substance and he behaves with constancy.

Liu: The wind coming out of the fire symbolizes The Family. The speech of the
superior man should have substance, and his conduct be enduring.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wind originating-from fire issuing-forth. Dwelling
People. A chun tzu uses words to possess beings and-also movement to possess
perseverance.

Cleary (1): Wind emerges from fire, members of a family. Thus is there
factuality in the speech of superior people, consistency in their deeds.

Cleary (2): ... Developed people are factual in speech, consistent in action.

Wu: Wind comes forth from fire; this is The Family. Thus the jun zi speaks
with facts and acts with perseverance.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Family the wife is in her correct place in the lower
trigram, and the husband in his correct place in the upper. That spouses occupy
their correct positions shows the correct relationship between heaven and earth.
The parents rule the family: let the father indeed be father, and the son son; let
the elder brother be indeed elder brother, and the younger brother younger; let
the husband indeed be husband, and the wife wife -- then the family will be in its
correct state. Bring the family to that state, and all under heaven will be
established.

Legge: The written Chinese character for Family simply means "a household,"
or "the members of a family." The lesson of the hexagram is the regulation of the
family, effected by the cooperation of the husband and wife in their several
spheres, and only needing it to become universal to secure the good order of the
kingdom. The important place accorded to the wife is seen in the short sentence
in the Judgment -- that she be firm and correct, and do her part well is essential
for the family's proper regulation.

The wife is represented by line two and the husband is her proper correlate
in line five. The relationship between heaven and earth is analogous to the
relationship between husband and wife.

The second sentence of the Confucian commentary, more closely rendered,
would be: "That in the family there is an authoritative ruler is a way of naming
father and mother." This means that the assertion of authority in a family should
be a correct balance of force and gentleness.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Anthony: The Family symbolizes correct relationships between people – the
family unit, the spiritual family (the Sage and the student), and human groups
generally. When these most basic relationships are correct, the world is made
correct through the force of inner truth, through cultivation of the feminine
component of our nature, and through persevering in a virtually menial position
(from our ego’s viewpoint) so that our work can come to fruition. All this means
to forgo striving and self-assertion, and to allow ourself to be led, while
persevering in gentleness and devotion to our path.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: For the correct regulation of the psyche, what is most important is
that the ego must be firm and correct.

The Superior Man lives his allegiance to the ideals of the Work.

Applying the Hermetic Axiom: "as above, so below," the relationships
within a family are analogous to the relationships within a city-state, or a
kingdom, and vice- versa:

Society centuries before the time of Confucius had been organized on the
basis of family. In the early days of the Chou dynasty fiefs had been
allotted to the feudal lords in a system of planned colonization. These
feudal lords, linked to one another and to the royal house by marriage
ties, took their families, retainers, peasants, artisans and soldiers to form
self-sufficient colonies based on an agricultural economy and governed
from well-fortified walled cities. These large family groupings of the
nobility were preserved only so long as the relationships of parents to
children, brothers to brothers, and masters to servants were effectively
controlled.
D.H. Smith -- Confucius

If the ideal city is like a family, then the analogy also holds for an
individual -- here the comparison goes directly from city to psyche:

Have we any greater evil for a city than what splits it and makes it many
instead of one? Or a greater good than what binds it together and makes
it one? ... Then is that city best governed which is most like a single
human being?
Plato -- The Republic

Psychologically interpreted, the hexagram of The Family symbolizes the
psyche, and the Confucian commentary tells us that when its inner components
all assume their proper roles and functions, then the Work will come into
fruition. ("All under heaven will be established.") The identical idea has been
stated in Gnostic thought:
37 -- The Family -- 37

Jesus said to them: "When you make eyes in the place of an eye, and a
hand in the place of a hand, and a foot in the place of a foot, and an
image in the place of an image, then shall you enter the Kingdom.
The Gnostic Gospel According to Thomas

The husband is the analogue of heaven or the Self, and the wife is the
analogue of earth or the ego. When the ego assumes its correct role as the
magnetic servant of the Work, then inner transformations can take place. I have
paraphrased the Judgment in terms of the necessity of the ego to follow the
dictates of the Work, but one could alternately phrase it in terms of keeping
emotional responses under control. For the wife to be "firm and correct" is to
ensure that emotions, drives and appetites are not allowed to make decisions --
they are servants, not masters. This is the essence of the Work, and arguably the
most reiterated idea in the I Ching.

The patient should be encouraged to use his mind, through observation
and discrimination, to bring clearly into his awareness the irrational
aspect of his drives and emotions, and also the possible drawbacks and
harmfulness to himself and others of their uncontrolled manifestation ...
To act on the spur of an impulse, a drive or an intense emotion can very
often produce undesirable effects which one afterwards regrets ...
Therefore, he should learn – by repeated experiment and effort – to
“insert” between impulse and action a stage of reflection, of mental
consideration of a situation, and of critical analysis of his impulse, trying
to realize its origin, its source.
R. Assagioli – Psychosynthesis

The thirty-seventh hexagram teaches us that the way to manage the
emotions is no different than the proper management of a Family. No wise
parent can teach a child self-discipline by adopting the child's point of view:
permissiveness, either with our children or our own primitive drives and
passions, is a sure formula for disintegration. The Work demands that the ego
hold the line on this issue -- indeed, it is the ego's only legitimate function.

We are dominated by everything with which our [ego] becomes
identified. We can dominate and control everything from which we
disidentify ourselves.
R. Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject establishing restrictive
regulations in his household. Occasion for repentance will disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Firm seclusion within the family. Remorse disappears.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Blofeld: The family dwelling stands within an enclosure -- regret vanishes.

Liu: He sets up a rule for his family. Remorse disappears. [People can expect
success in their plans.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Enclosing: possessing Dwelling. Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: The gate has a family; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): Guarding the home, regret vanishes.

Wu: A family lives by the principle. There will be no regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He establishes rules before any change has taken place in
their wills. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will has not yet changed. Blofeld: The first
part of this passage symbolizes determination which has never swerved.
Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose not-yet transformed indeed. Cleary (2): The aim
does not change. Wu: The goal has not been changed.

Legge: Line one is dynamic in a dynamic place. It suggests the necessity of strict
rule in governing the family. Regulations must be established, and their
observance strictly insisted on.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man establishes firm rules of order and relationships in
the household. Overindulgence of a young child leads to the difficult task of
breaking the child's will later on.

Wing: At the very beginning of relationships or endeavors, you establish firm
roles and well-defined systems, then all will go well. Even occasions that might
give rise to arguments will pass without remorse.

Editor: A house symbolizes the whole psyche, so a household is all of the entities
which make it up -- thoughts, feelings, appetites, passions, etc. The idea here is
that one must maintain consistency and order in the situation at hand, and not
allow any deviation from that order. Implied is the injunction not to indulge in
inappropriate expressions of emotion. The line can sometimes mean that you
have everything you need to succeed within you: you don't have to seek outside
for what you already possess.

Therefore when the light circulates, the energies of the whole body
appear before its throne, as, when a holy king has established the capital
and has laid down the fundamental rules of order, all the states approach

37 -- The Family -- 37

with tribute; or as, when the master is quiet and calm, men- servants and
maids obey his orders of their own accord, and each does his work.
The Secret of the Golden Flower

A. Put your house in order. Maintain discipline, define your parameters,
and organize your priorities.

B. Restrict and control the expression of autonomous forces within the
psyche. Do not deviate from established order.

C. You already have everything you require to attain your goals.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject taking nothing on herself,
but in her central place attending to the preparation of the food. Through her
firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: She should not follow her whims. She must attend within to
the food. Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: This is a time when nothing can be brought to completion; however,
within the household, righteous persistence brings good fortune.

Liu: Her duties are to keep the household and prepare the food; she should not
pursue her fancies. Persistence leads to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without direction, releasing. Locating the center, feeding.
Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: There is no place to follow, in the middle of the food;
determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Not concentrating on anything, being chaste in the kitchen is
auspicious.

Cleary (2): Not concentrating on anything but household duties, it bodes well to
be chaste.

Wu: There is nothing suitable to do outside of the family. There will be
good fortune to prepare meals inside.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is due to the docility of its subject
operating with humility. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune depends upon
37 -- The Family -- 37

devotion and gentleness. Blofeld: Namely, good fortune arising from
compliance and gentleness. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding uses Ground indeed.
Cleary (2): What bodes well is docile obedience. Wu: The good fortune comes
from the subject’s modesty.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, in the proper and central place in the lower
trigram. It fitly represents the wife, and describes her special sphere and duty.
She should be unassuming in regard to all beyond her sphere, always being firm
and correct. Docility is suggested by the magnetic line. The humility comes from
the upper trigram, whose attribute is Pliant Flexibility

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The good fortune of the family lies primarily in the unassuming role of the
wife, who looks after the welfare of the family and food for the sacrifice. Similarly,
in governmental affairs the state of public welfare depends primarily upon the
unassuming civil servant who confines himself to the duties at hand.

Wing: Don't succumb to impulses now. Seek nothing by force. Restrain such
actions that are not part of the business at hand. Good fortune comes when the
immediate needs of The Family are met.

Editor: The image is a clear picture of a magnetic element remaining in its
proper place. That is, the "female" components -- emotions, feelings, etc., must
remain within the psyche to nourish its growth, evolution and eventual
transformation. An inappropriate expression of emotion invariably spells
disaster for the Work. Since the polarity of the ego is always magnetic in relation
to the dynamic Self, the line can also refer to keeping the ego in its proper sphere
of influence.

Our emotions are probably untrustworthy when it comes to providing us
with a basis for action. Fear and aggression, for instance, were useful
during thousands of years of prehistory when our ancestors had to
battle for survival against savage and cunning enemies. But today,
these same emotions, when unrecognized and unchecked, lead to such
dangerous acts as the relentless stockpiling of nuclear arms, or the
unnecessary expansion of territorial borders.
R.M. Restak -- The Brain: The Last Frontier

A. Tend to your proper business -- do not step outside your sphere of duty.

B. Control your emotional responses to nourish the evolution and
integration of psychic processes.
37 -- The Family -- 37
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject treating the members of the
household with stern severity. There will be occasion for repentance, there will
be peril, but there will also be good fortune. If the wife and children were to be
smirking and chattering, in the end there would be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When tempers flare up in the family, too great a severity
brings remorse. Good fortune nonetheless. When women and children dally and
laugh, it leads in the end to humiliation.

Blofeld: When members of the family speak sharply to one another, the mutual
regret and the serious situation which follow may lead to good fortune; but if the
women and children take to tittering, misfortune is assured. [An occasional
scolding may not do much harm, but constant mockery of parents or husband
will cause irreparable damage to family accord. The former, if followed by
regret and by the threat of an unwanted quarrel or separation, may bring
people to their senses and make them mutually more considerate than hitherto.]

Liu: If the members of the family are severe toward each other, there will be
seriousness but good fortune. When women and children are silly, there will be
regret in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dwelling People, scolding, scolding: Repenting, adversity
significant. The wife, the son, giggling, giggling: Completing abashed.

Shaughnessy: The family members so excited; regret; danger; auspicious. The
wife and children are so introspective; in the end distress.

Cleary (1): People in the home are strict. Conscientious sternness bodes well. If
the women and children are too frivolous, it will end in humiliation.

Wu: Family members complain about stern discipline. Though regrettable and
disturbing, it is auspicious. When women and children are frivolous, there is
cause for humiliation.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Stern severity means that there has been no great failure in
the regulation of the family. When wife and children are smirking and
chattering, the proper economy of the family has been lost. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
"When tempers flare..." nothing is as yet lost. "When woman and child dally,"
the discipline of the house is lost. Blofeld: Because sharp words do not cause
much harm, but the tittering of women and children leads to the destruction of
good order within the family. Ritsema/ Karcher: Not-yet letting-go indeed.
The wife, the son, giggling, giggling: Letting-go Dwelling articulating indeed.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Cleary (2): It is not a mistake for the people in the home to be strict. When the
women and children are frivolous, the order of a household is lost. Wu: The
principle is not abandoned. Proper conduct is violated.

Legge: Line three is dynamic in a dynamic place. If the place were central, the
energy would be tempered, but he is at the top of the trigram, and may be
expected to exceed in severity. But severity is not a bad thing in regulating a
family -- it is better than laxity and indulgence.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A proper balance must be struck between indulgence and severity. However,
severity, despite occasional mistakes, is preferable to a lack of discipline.

Wing: A moderate path to establishing order in the situation must be found.
A balance should be struck between careless indulgence and severe discipline.
When in doubt, however, it is far better to be overly severe than to allow the
situation to become lost in the chaos of indulgence.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the first line shows the establishment of
rules within the psyche, and the third line shows their enforcement. The wife
symbolizes the Eros function: the feelings, desires, appetites and drives; and the
children represent the proliferation of new psychic "entities" which are created in
the normal day to day intercourse of thought and feeling. The image pertains to
maintaining a balance between two extremes -- severity and permissiveness. If
one must err, it is better to be too severe than too lax. The Greeks were fully
aware that Eros is a "mighty daemon":

When Sophocles speaks of Eros as a power that "warps to wrong the
righteous mind, for its destruction," we should not dismiss this as
"personification": behind it lies the old Homeric feeling that these things
are not truly within man's conscious control; they are endowed with a
life and energy of their own, and so can force a man, as it were from the
outside, into conduct foreign to him.
E.R. Dodds -- The Greeks and the Irrational

In terms of the Work, of course, these forces are not only some degree within our
control, but it is the ego’s specific duty to control them as much as possible. That
is what this line is all about.

A. Get a grip on yourself -- control your emotional responses.

B. Impose restrictions and order. Define hierarchy.
37 -- The Family -- 37
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject enriching the family. There
will be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: She is the treasure of the house. Great good fortune.

Blofeld: A well-to-do household -- great good fortune!

Liu: One makes the family prosperous. Great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Affluence Dwelling, the great significant.

Shaughnessy: A wealthy family; greatly auspicious.

Cleary (1): A rich home is very fortunate.

Wu: This is a wealthy family with great auspiciousness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to her docility and because she is in her correct
place. Wilhelm/Baynes: For she is devoted and in her place. Blofeld: This
good fortune is indicated by the position of the line which symbolizes cheerful
acceptance. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding located-in the situation indeed.
Cleary (2): Docilely occupying its position. Wu: Because its position is well
taken.

Legge: Line four is magnetic and in her proper place. The wife is again
suggested to us, and despite her confinement to the internal affairs of the
household, she can do much to enrich the family. Yu Yen (Yuan Dynasty)
observes that the riches of a family are not to be sought in its wealth, but in the
affection and harmony of its members. Where these prevail the family is not
likely to be poor, and whatever it has will be well preserved.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The woman of the family balances the income and expenditures, enriching
the well-being and peace of the family. The faithful steward performs the same
service for public welfare.

Wing: Attention to details pertaining to the economy of the situation brings
good-fortune. Any attempts to further the well-being of others in a modest and
humble way will be successful.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Editor: This line restates the message of the Judgment. Psychologically
speaking, it re-affirms the idea that emotional energy under control and in its
proper place is a great source of personal power. This is an image of the ideal role
of the ego in relation to the Work.

Control of the emotions is a very important element of self-control in
general. Often the concept of self-control conjures up the image of an
emotionless, dry, rigid way of life. If a person is in complete control of
his emotions, however, he can call forth any emotion he desires and is
free to enhance it as he wills. Rather than be controlled by emotions such
as love, yearning, or awe, he can control them. One can evoke these
emotions and blend them together, painting every aspect of life with a
rich palette of feelings. Control of the emotions can thus lead a person to
experience a richer blend of feelings in his daily life than the average
person generally experiences.
Aryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation

A. Our emotions must serve us, not rule us.

B. The whole is enriched by the rectitude of one of its parts.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the influence of the king extending to his
family. There need be no anxiety -- there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: As a king he approaches his family. Fear not. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The King draws near to his family (i.e. the nation) -- no cause for
worry; good fortune!

Liu: The King extends his love to the family (country) without worry. Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The king imagines possessing a Dwelling. Beings: care
significant.

Shaughnessy: The king approaches his family; do not pity; going is auspicious.

Cleary (1): The king comes to have a home; no worry – it is fortunate.

Cleary (2): The king has a great home. Do not worry; it is auspicious.

Wu: The king succeeds in making the nation like a family. It is auspicious,
without worries.
37 -- The Family -- 37
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The relationship between them is that of mutual love.
Wilhelm/Baynes: They associate with one another in love. Blofeld: This
means that the ruler and his people meet together with love in their hearts. [This
may be interpreted to mean that we enjoy the affection of our superiors or
bestow affection on our juniors and those in our charge.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Mingling mutual affection indeed. Cleary (2): With communication and mutual
love. Wu: Because the people love and respect one another.

Legge: The subject of the dynamic fifth line appears as the king. This may be the
husband spoken of as also a king, or the real king whose merit is revealed first in
his family. The central place here tempers the display of strength and power. The
mention of "mutual love" is unusual in Chinese writings, and must be considered
remarkable here. "The husband," says Ch'eng-tzu, "loves his helpmate in the
house; the wife loves him who is the pattern for the family."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The father is not feared by the family. Like a richly endowed king, he
governs through mutual affection and tempers the display of his powers.

Wing: A magnanimous and loving relationship exists between the leader and
his followers. There is no reason to fear openness in these kinds of relationships.
Good fortune comes through a beneficial influence.

Editor: This line can be problematic and is occasionally received under less than
lucid circumstances. The "influence of the king" can be interpreted
psychologically as the action of the Self in the inner dimensions and hence a
reassurance that things are going as they should, even if they don't appear that
way to our limited viewpoint in Spacetime.

God is bound to act, to pour Himself into thee as soon as He shall find
thee ready.
Meister Eckhart

A. A superior element influences subordinate elements for the overall
benefit of the whole.

B. Relax, don't worry -- "Someone up there likes you."

C. Proper influence comes from affectionate regard, not tyranny.

D. Nourish your inner harmony -- attend to your legitimate needs.
37 -- The Family -- 37
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject possessed of sincerity and
arrayed in majesty. In the end there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His work commands respect. In the end good fortune
comes.

Blofeld: His sincerity (and/or confidence) is such as to make him appear awe-
inspiring -- good fortune in the end!

Liu: Sincerity and dignity bring good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, impressing thus. Completing
significant.

Shaughnessy: There is a return stooped-like; in the end auspicious.

Cleary (1): There is trustworthiness, dignified; it turns out well.

Cleary (2): There is truthfulness, which is impressive. The end is auspicious.

Wu: He is confident in his dignity and will have good fortune in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is the result of the recovery of the true character.
Wilhelm/Baynes: This indicates that one makes demands first of all upon
oneself. Blofeld: He will enjoy good fortune because he subjects himself
frequently to self-examination. Ritsema/Karcher: Reversing individuality's
designating indeed. Cleary (2): What is auspicious about his impressiveness is
that it calls for personal transformation. Wu: He often examines his own
conduct.

Legge: Line six is also dynamic, and being in a magnetic place, he might
degenerate into stern severity. But he is sincere and complete in himself. His
majesty is not artificial: his character is remolded and perfected, hence his action
will only lead to good fortune. The words of Mencius are aptly quoted in
illustration of the lesson: "If a man himself does not walk in the right path, it will
not be walked in even by his wife and children."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: It is the father's character which eventually determines order and unity in
the family. He should be sincere and majestic.
37 -- The Family -- 37

Wing: Your character and its development will be enhanced. Your sense of
responsibility toward yourself and others brings good fortune and success. You
will be recognized and respected for your insights and virtuous works.

Editor: The concept rendered as "sincerity" in English is extremely important in
Chinese thought, with connotations which transcend our ordinary definition of
the word. Wing-Tsit Chan defines it: "This word means not only sincerity in the
narrow sense, but also honesty, absence of fault, seriousness, being true to one's
true self, being true to the nature of being, actuality, realness." The line can
imply a compliment for good work, saying, in effect, that your attitude is in
accordance with that which promotes integration and harmony in the family of
the psyche.

When the Way of Heaven [or principle] and the nature of man [or
desires] function separately, there cannot be sincerity. When there is a
difference between the knowledge obtained by following the Way of
Heaven and that obtained by following the nature of man, there cannot
be perfect enlightenment. What is meant by enlightenment resulting
from sincerity is that in which there is no distinction between the Way of
Heaven as being great and the nature of man as being small.
Chang Tsai -- Enlightenment Resulting from Sincerity

A. Your heart and mind are in the right place.

B. The Self attains its purpose.

C. Self-discipline is the parent of self-respect.

38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-EIGHT –
MUTUAL ALIENATION

Other titles: Opposition, The Symbol of Strangeness and Disunion, The
Estranged, Opposites, Polarizing, Alienation, Distant From, Perversion,
Disharmony, Separated, Contradiction, Estrangement, Incongruity

Judgment

Legge: Despite Mutual Alienation there will be success in small matters.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Opposition. in small matters, good fortune.

Blofeld: The Estranged -- good fortune in small matters.

Liu: Opposition. In small things, good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Polarizing, Small Affairs significant. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of things that are connected but should not
join. It emphasizes that putting things in opposition while acknowledging their
essential link is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Perversion: Little affairs are auspicious.

Cleary (1): Disharmony. A small matter will turn out all right.

Cleary (2): Opposition, Etc.

Wu: Incongruity indicates auspiciousness for doing small things.

The Image

Legge: The image of fire over a marsh forms Mutual Alienation. The superior
man, in accordance with this, accepts the diversities which make up the whole.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Above fire; below the lake: the image of Opposition. Thus
amid all fellowship the superior man retains his individuality.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire above and a marshy lake below. The
Superior Man achieves difference through unity.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Liu: Fire above the lake symbolizes Opposition. Living with the people, the
superior man distinguishes among them.

Ritsema/Karcher: Fire above, marsh below. Polarizing. A chun tzu uses
concording and-also dividing. [Cf. Solve et Coagula—Ed.]

Cleary (1): Above is fire, below is a lake, disparate. Thus are superior people
the same yet different.

Cleary (2): Above is fire, below is a lake – opposite. Developed people, etc.

Wu: Fire above and marsh below form Incongruity. Thus the Jun zi take
separate paths, but arrive at the same goal.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Mutual Alienation we see fire ascending and water
descending. We see two sisters living together whose wills move in opposite
directions. However, the lower trigram of Cheerfulness is attached to the upper
trigram of Clarity, and the magnetic fifth line is responded to by the dynamic
second line; these are signs that there can still be good fortune in small matters.
Heaven and earth are separate and apart, but the work which they do is the same.
Male and female are separate and apart, but with a common will they seek the
same object. There is a diversity between the myriad classes of beings, but there
is an analogy between their several operations. Great indeed are the phenomena
and the results of this condition of disunion and separation.

Legge: Mutual Alienation shows a condition in which disunion and mistrust
prevail. The hexagram teaches how this state of affairs may be overcome in small
matters and the way prepared for the cure of the whole system. The
commentators suggest that the condition symbolized here is a necessary sequel to
the regulation of the family in the preceding hexagram.

The K'ang-hsi editors observe that in many hexagrams we have two daughters
dwelling together, but that only in this and number forty-nine is attention called
to it. The reason is that in these two diagrams the sisters are the second and third
daughters, while in the others one of them is the eldest, whose place and
superiority are fixed, so that between her and either of the others there can be no
division or collision. The lesson in the Confucian commentary is not unity in
diversity, but union with diversity.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: In resolving disputes, begin with their least controversial aspects.

The Superior Man respects alternative points of view.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Turn the hexagram of Family upside-down and you get the hexagram of
Mutual Alienation. The opposite of family unity is estrangement, which
combined with the idea of polarity, suggests the kind of energetic "pushing away"
one feels when two horseshoe magnets are matched to the same poles. Despite
this opposition however, every line deals positively with the situation -- there is
not one image in the hexagram that doesn't intimate an eventual resolution.

The thirty-eighth hexagram lays even more emphasis than usual on the
relationships (polarities) existing between its correlate lines. This suggests that
inner connections outrank any superficial estrangement. The Mutual
Alienation then, is not a permanent condition -- it represents more of a
challenge than a disaster. All polarity is potential energy to accomplish useful
work, and in this hexagram the polarities are more than usually available for this
purpose. This doesn't mean that the work here is necessarily easy, just that it
offers a major opportunity for growth.

A crisis develops when some pressure or event creates a state of
uncomfortable disequilibrium which fails to respond to usual defenses
and coping mechanisms. It involves danger with both a considerable
risk for worsening and opportunity for growth (with enhancement of
insight, mastery, and self-esteem) ... The patient should be educated to
understand his situation and helped to see that painful episodes may
prove to be part of a constructive process, and are not proof of a dire
outcome.
R.P. Kluft -- Hypnotherapeutic Crisis Intervention in
Multiple Personality

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows that to its subject occasion for repentance
will disappear. He has lost his horses, but let him not seek for them -- they will
return of themselves. Should he meet with bad men, he will not err in
communicating with them.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse disappears. If you lose your horse, do not run after
it; it will come back of its own accord. When you see evil people, guard yourself
against mistakes.

Blofeld: Regret vanishes! Do not follow the straying horse, for it will return of its
own accord. Though he allows evil men to visit him, he remains without error.

Liu: Remorse vanishes. If one loses a horse, one should not look for it; it will
return by itself. Even if one sees evil men, no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished. Losing the horse, no pursuit,
originating-from returning. Visualizing hateful people. Without fault.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone; Losing a horse, do not pursue; it will of itself
return. Seeing an ugly man; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Regret disappears: When you lose the horse, don’t chase it – it will
return on its own. Seeing an evil person, there is no blame.

Cleary (2): Regret vanishes. Having lost the horse, do not chase after it – it will
come back by itself. Seeing evil people, there is no blame. [Whenever thoughts of
gain and loss become serious, or the idea of good and bad is too defined, then
what is the same will be differentiated, and what is different cannot be made the
same. Only when we follow firm and upright celestial virtue do gain and loss
disappear, good and bad merge. Then even if we are
in a time of oppositions, we can be free of regret.]

Wu: There will be no regret. He need not look for a lost horse, as it will come
back by itself. If he meets with a disagreeable man, there will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He communicates with the bad men to avoid the evil of their
condemnation. Wilhelm/Baynes: When you see evil people, avoid mistakes.
Blofeld: That is to say, his very purpose in receiving them is to avoid error. [We
must expect to encounter unlikable people whom it would be impolitic or
dangerous to ignore.] Ritsema/Karcher: Using casting-out fault indeed.
Cleary (2): Seeing evil people, one avoids blame. Wu: He meets with a
disagreeable man to avoid getting into troubles.

Legge: The first line is dynamic in a dynamic place, but his correlate in line four
is also dynamic, so disappointment and repentance are likely to ensue. However,
through the good services of line four the first line won't have to repent. His
condition may be symbolized by a traveler’s loss of his horses, which return to
him of themselves.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man slips into avoidable mistakes during times of
opposition. When members of his own fold are estranged, he should not run after
them; he should let them come back of their own accord. On the other hand,
those who do not belong to this group but force their evil presence into the
company must be endured. This silences their slanderous tongues; they will
withdraw of their own accord.

Wing: There is an estrangement present between elements that naturally belong
together. Do not try to reunify the situation with force. Allow things to return to a
state of accord naturally, as they will. Do not worry about it. Things will work
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

themselves out. If something inferior is being forced upon you, a cold shoulder
will work wonders.

Editor: Psychologically, to lose one's horses is to lose one's power, or to have
emotion "run away with itself." The image suggests a temporary loss which one
need not worry about. To "communicate with bad men" means to consciously
monitor your negative feelings -- to be aware of resentments, fears, hostility, or
whatever the situation has called forth, without acting on them. In other words,
maintain your will in the face of unstable impulses. The unusual beneficial
correlation between two dynamic lines in one and four recalls a similar
configuration in hexagram number fifty-five.

Analytic experience has shown that there seems to be a general law
which decides between psychic health and psychopathology. The balance
is tipped by the ego's strength, capacity and willingness to unbar the
doors and windows to the unconscious and to receive the stranger; that
is, to confront and channel the inner world of images and affects while,
at the same time, retaining its own grasp upon external reality.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. A temporary conflict will soon resolve itself. Endure the inferior
elements in the situation without polarizing them to action.

B. For the moment your emotions have run away with you. Confront a
harmful or severely limiting attitude or belief.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject happening to meet with his
ruler in a bye-passage. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One meets his lord in a narrow street. No blame.

Blofeld: He encountered his lord in a narrow lane -- no error!

Liu: One meets his superior in an alley. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Meeting a lord, tending-towards the street. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Meeting the ruler in an alley; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Meeting the master in an alley, there is no blame. [When yin and
yang have gotten out of harmony, aberrant energy is strong and true sane
energy is weak – the mind of Tao is not easy to meet. However, if firmness is
applied with flexibility, advancing by way of a small path, using the human
mind to produce the mind of Tao, this is like “meeting the master in an alley.”
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

The formerly blameworthy can then be blameless. This is setting disharmony
right when it is in full force.]

Cleary (2): Meeting the ruler, etc.

Wu: He meets his master in a lane. There will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He has not deviated for this meeting from the proper course.
Wilhelm/Baynes: If one meets his lord in a narrow street, one has not lost his
way. Blofeld: He was not in error for he had not strayed from his path.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet letting-go tao indeed. Cleary (2): Does not deviate
from the right way. Wu: He has not gone beyond the bounds.

Legge: The fifth-line correlate of the second line is magnetic and the two might
meet openly if it weren't for the separation and disunion of the time. A casual, as
it were a stolen interview, as in a bye-lane or passage, will be useful however, and
may lead to better understanding.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Misunderstanding prevents people who share an inner affinity from meeting
together in the normal way. A casual meeting between the man and his master
under informal circumstances proves useful.

Wing: An unexpected or accidental encounter with an important idea or person
will benefit you. There is a natural attraction at work here, although a direct
approach would have been inconceivable or impossible.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): (Man)...accepts his karma, his fate,
which from within the situation has been given him and which he affirms. The
image of the narrow street indicates that this is not a simple transaction. A
counterpart is, for example, found in the Bible, when a prophet receives his
calling. Prophets are such men who have met their masters in narrow streets.
How the prophet Jeremiah rages and complains! All his life he reproaches God
for having burdened him with too heavy a load, but nonetheless accepts his
destiny and completes the task.

Editor: The image is one of a meeting (union) between high and low in a tight
place, or under restricted circumstances. This "narrow passage," pinched
circumstances, or rough-going, could refer to the discipline of the Work. An
ego/Self connection is implied.

The aim of the ordinary man is to live his life avoiding all difficulties,
discomforts and unpleasantness within the bounds of his conscience. The
esoteric student should be a man with a very demanding conscience and

38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

so his life is more difficult. This does not mean that he goes about seeking
for or making difficulties for himself, but he meets all obstacles as a
challenge, and the greater the obstacle the greater the opportunity it is
for him to overcome the weaker aspects of his nature.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. Truth or duty is encountered in a tight spot or limited situation.

B. Restricted circumstances evoke their own dynamics for growth. Stress
is a great teacher.

C. "A tough row to hoe." A difficult (fated) co-incidence of some kind.
Line-3

Legge: In the third line, magnetic, we see one whose carriage is dragged back,
while the oxen in it are pushed back, and she is herself subjected to the shaving of
her head and the cutting off of her nose. There is no good beginning, but there
will be a good end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One sees the wagon dragged back, the oxen halted, a man's
hair and nose cut off. Not a good beginning, but a good end.

Blofeld: He watched them dragging at his axle and striking his oxen. As for
himself, his topknot and nose were sliced off -- not much of a beginning, but
there was an end to his troubles. [This is a frighteningly inauspicious line. We
must expect severe trouble; the only comfort we can take is the knowledge that
it will not be permanent.]

Liu: When the ox stopped, the cart moved back. He sees a man whose hair
and nose have been cut off. Misfortune in the beginning, good fortune later.

Ritsema/Karcher: Visualizing the cart pulled-back. One's cattle hampered.
One's person stricken, moreover nose-cut. Without initially possessing
completion.

Shaughnessy: Seeing the cart with one horn upturned, its cow dragging, its
man branded on the forehead and with his nose cut off; there is no beginning,
there is an end.

Cleary (1): One sees the vehicle dragged back, the ox halted; the person’s hair
and nose are cut off. There is no beginning, but there is an end.

Cleary (2): Having the vehicle dragged back, the ox halted, the person is
punished by heaven. There is no beginning, but there is an end.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Wu: He sees a cart pulled back, its ox led away, and its carter’s forehead tattooed
and his nose cut off. He has a bad beginning that ends well.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The carriage is drawn back because of the inappropriateness
of the line's position. The good end arises from her meeting with the strong
topmost line. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the right one. This happens
through meeting one that is firm. Blofeld: The first part of this passage is
indicated by the unsuitable position of the line. That, despite this poor beginning,
there is an end to his troubles -- or ours -- can be deduced from this line's
meeting with a firm one immediately above it. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not
appropriate indeed. Meeting a solid indeed. Cleary (2): Out of place. Having
firmness. Wu: His place is out of order. He engages in strength.

Legge: Line three is magnetic where it ought to be dynamic. Her correlate line
six is dynamic, and the relation between them might be correct if the magnetic
three wasn't sandwiched between the dynamic second and fourth lines. Because
it is a time of disunion, these two check and repulse her. At the same time, line
six inflicts upon three the punishments mentioned. It is thus bad for three at
first, but in the end it will go well with her, and this will be due to the strength of
the sixth line. What is right and good is destined to triumph over what is wrong
and bad. Disorder shall eventually give place to order, and disunion to union.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Things look completely hopeless. The man is opposed and dishonored. But
if he clings to what he believes to be right, the ending will be good.

Wing: Difficulties will pile on difficulties and you will be opposed at every turn.
Although this is a bad beginning, there is a possibility of a good ending. Cling to
what you know is right or align yourself with a strong helper and the matter will
end well.

Wilhelm (from Lectures on the I Ching): A complete change is taking place.
This, however, is connected with utmost difficulty... This is the time of battles.
Often, just after receiving the call, one makes no progress. And even if one
succeeds for a short time, obstructions soon develop. One's own person is seen as
weak among so many strong persons, and the movement, which is still governed
by opposition that must be overcome, has at every step internal as well as
external obstructions.

Editor: This is a very difficult line. Carriage: Vehicle, forward motion, ability to
advance. Oxen: Castrated bulls used as draft animals: an image of inexorable
power or motive force. Hair: Energy, power, (Samson lost his strength when his
hair was cut off.) Nose: Subtle discrimination, intuition. The line is an image of
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

(usually undeserved) interference that impedes development. Sometimes it can
be a reminder that humiliation and impotence in the service of the Work do not
last forever.

The news from France is very bad, and I grieve for the gallant French
people who have fallen into this terrible misfortune. We shall defend our
island, and, with the British Empire around us, we shall fight on
unconquerable until the curse of Hitler is lifted from the brows of men.
We are sure that in the end all will be well.
Winston Churchill, June 17, 1940

A. It seems all but impossible to succeed now. However, if you keep the faith, the
prognosis is for victory.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject solitary amidst the prevailing
disunion. But he meets with the good man represented by the first line, and they
blend their sincere desires together. The position is one of peril, but there will be
no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Isolated through opposition, one meets a like-minded man
with whom one can associate in good faith. Despite the danger, no blame.

Blofeld: After suffering estrangement and loneliness, she met an admirable
husband and mutual confidence grew between them -- unpleasantness, but no
error! [For those to whom the literal interpretation does not apply, the last six
words of the commentary are all that matter.]

Liu: Isolated owing to opposition, he meets a strong man and they associate
sincerely. Even though there is danger, no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Polarizing alone. Meeting Spring, husbanding. Mingling
conforming.

Shaughnessy: Perverse solitude; meeting the prime fellow and interacting
returning; danger; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Disharmony in solitude; meeting good people, associate sincerely,
and though it be trying, there will be no fault.

Cleary (2): The solitude of opposition. Meeting good people, associate sincerely,
work hard, and there will be no blame.

Wu: He is isolated because of incongruity. He meets with a man of strength.
With mutual trust, there will be no error despite difficult situations.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Their common aim is carried into effect. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The will effects its purpose. Blofeld: What is said about mutual
confidence and freedom from error indicates the fulfillment of what is willed.
Ritsema/Karcher: Adversity, without fault. Mingling conforming, without
fault. Purpose moving indeed. Cleary (2): Associate sincerely, and there will be
no blame, for the aim will be carried out. Wu: With mutual trust there will be no
error, because his wishes prevail.

Legge: Line four has no proper correlate, and might seem to be solitary. But, as
we saw on line one, in this hexagram, correlates of the same class help each other.
Hence lines four and one meet together and work with good will and success.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man finds a like-minded person among the opposition. They blend
their honest desires and achieve a common goal.

Wing: In the midst of opposition and isolation you will find someone with whom
you have an inner affinity. A mutual trust can now develop and dangers can be
overcome together. This cooperation can lead to significant accomplishments.

Editor: The image is one of an alliance with a kindred spirit during troubled
times. Wilhelm and Blofeld render the Confucian commentary in terms of
willpower achieving its goal. Psychologically, the image of this line suggests a
strong connection between ego and Self during a period of general psychic
polarization.

Man's free will arises from the fact that he feels the life in himself as his
own, and that God leaves him so to feel in order that conjunction may be
effected -- which is not possible unless it be reciprocal, and it becomes
reciprocal when man acts from freedom altogether as from himself.
Swedenborg -- True Christian Religion

A. Forces in opposition create estrangement and isolation. Association
with a strong unifying force creates conditions for resolving the conflict. Despite
estrangement and disunion, one has an ally.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows that to its subject occasion for repentance
will disappear. With her relative and minister she unites closely and readily as if
she were biting through a piece of skin. When she goes forward with this help,
what error can there be?
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse disappears. The companion bites his way through
the wrappings. If one goes to him, how could it be a mistake?

Blofeld: Regret vanishes! The head of the clan bites through the flesh (or meat).
What is there to prevent him proceeding (with his plans)? [This just means that
all will go well with our plans. The head of the clan is our mind; the flesh is the
difficulty we shall succeed in overcoming.]

Liu: Remorse vanishes. The member of the clan bites the skin. Going. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished. Your ancestor gnawing flesh.
Going wherefore faulty?

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone. Climbing up the ancestral temple and biting
flesh; in going what trouble is there?

Cleary (1): Regret vanishes; the ally bites through the skin. What fault is there
in joy?

Cleary (2): Regret vanishes. With the ally in close cooperation, what is wrong
with proceeding?

Wu: There will be no regret. His association with his relative is close like biting
into a piece of skin. If he chooses to proceed, what error can there be?

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her going forward will afford ground for congratulation.
Wilhelm/Baynes: If one goes to him, it brings blessing. Blofeld: To proceed
with current plans will result in blessings. [I.e. unexpected good fortune.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Going possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): With the ally
in close cooperation, to proceed will result in celebration. Wu: This means to
proceed is to have celebration.

Legge: The place of five is dynamic, but the line itself is magnetic, so that there
might arise occasion for repentance. But the dynamic second line is a proper
correlate. Because five is in the ruler's place, line two is seen as a relative of the
same surname and head of some branch of the royal house. It is as easy for five,
so supported, to deal with the disunion of the time as to bite through a piece of
skin.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The true nature of the companion is revealed by looking beneath the
surface. The man joins with him to deal effectively with the disunion.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

Wing: Because of a general atmosphere of Contradiction and opposition you
may fail to recognize someone who can sincerely help you. This person may
reveal himself in spite of the mistrust that clouds your perspective. Working
together on current plans will now bring good fortune.

Editor: Biting: Differentiation, discernment, "cutting through the red tape," etc.
(cf., Hexagram number twenty-one: Differentiation.) Skin: The outer layer,
protective surface, facade, persona, superficial appearances, etc. To bite through
the skin is to get to the meat of the matter. Relative and minister: An allied
power, the Self. (Ritsema/Karcher mention the "ancestor," and Shaughnessy, the
"ancestral temple" -- further clues that we are dealing with inner powers: i.e., the
Self.)

The God of the Macrocosm and the God of the Microcosm act upon each
other, and both are essentially one, for there is only one God and one law
and one Nature, through which wisdom becomes manifest.
Paracelsus -- De Fundamento Sapientiae

A. Cut through surface appearances to reach a deeper level of
understanding.

B. Image of an ego/Self connection. Proceed with your plans.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject solitary amidst the prevailing
disunion. In the subject of the third line, he seems to see a pig bearing on its back
a load of mud, or fancies there is a carriage full of ghosts. He first bends his bow
against her, and afterwards unbends it, for he discovers that she is not an
assailant to injure, but a near relative. Going forward, he shall meet with the
genial rain, and there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Isolated through opposition, one sees one's companion as
a pig covered with dirt, as a wagon full of devils. First one draws a bow against
him, then one lays the bow aside. He is not a robber; he will woo at the right
time. As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.

Blofeld: Wandering estranged and lonely, he saw a boar covered with mud and
a wagon loaded with demons. First he stretched his bow, but then put it aside. It
is not an obstacle but a matter of betrothal which causes delay or hesitation. If
rain is encountered during the conduct of affairs, good fortune will ensue. [The
first two sentences imply that we shall meet with unpleasant and frightening
things; that, at first, we shall think to fend them off, but then decide to let them
be. The sentence about betrothal means only that there will be some delay or
hesitation for very good reasons. The last sentence may or may not mean
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38

exactly what it says. If we decide that it is not to be taken literally, then we must
take it to mean that a slight setback on the way is a good omen.]

Liu: Isolated due to opposition, one sees a dirty pig by the roadside, and many
devils in a cart. First he draws his bow against him, then he puts it down. He is
not a robber, he will propose marriage. If he meets the rainfall, there will be good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Polarizing alone. Visualizing pigs bearing mire. Carrying
souls, the-one chariot. Beforehand stretching's bow. Afterwards stimulating's
bow. In-no-way outlawry, matrimonial allying. Going meeting rain, by-
consequence significant.

Shaughnessy: Perverse solitude; seeing a pig with mud on its back and one cart
carrying ghosts; the first drawn bow is later released into the jar; it is not robbers
who in the evening have intercourse; going and meeting rain then it will be
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Disharmony results in isolation; see a pig covered with mire, a
wagon carrying devils. First you draw the bow, later you put the bow down. It is
not an enemy but a partner. Going on, it is fortunate if you encounter rain.

Cleary (2): ... Encountering rain, then there is good fortune.

Wu: He is isolated because of incongruity. He sees a pig hoarding mud on its
back and a cart loaded with ghosts. At first he draws his bow, but soon after
laying it down, he realizes what he sees is not a transgressor, but a suitor. It will
be auspicious if he goes ahead and encounters rain.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune of the rain symbolizes the passing away of
all doubts. Wilhelm/Baynes: All doubts disappear. Blofeld: The last
sentence implies the dispersal of all doubt. [Coupling this commentary with
what is said about rain, we may suppose that, if rain (or an unexpected
setback) occurs, then we shall no longer have any reason to doubt the successful
outcome of our plans.] Ritsema/Karcher: The flock doubt extinguished
indeed. Cleary (2): Doubts disappear. Wu: The dissolution of all doubts.

Legge: Line six is a magnetic place, yet this line is dynamic -- what can he do?
He looks at the magnetic three, his proper correlate, with the mistrustful eye of
disunion. The third line appears no better than a filthy pig, no more real than an
impossible carriage-load of ghosts. He bends his bow, then unbends it when he
discovers that three is his friend, as did one in four, and five in two. He acts with
good luck, comparable to the falling rain which results from the happy union of
the yang and yin in nature.
38 -- Mutual Alienation -- 38
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man misjudges his friend unfairly because of misunderstandings. But
he realizes his mistake and relieves the tension.

Wing: Misunderstandings and mistrust have caused you to lose all perspective.
You see your true friends as enemies and become defensive. You will, however,
see your mistakes, and the tensions will be relieved. Just when Contradictions
are at their worst they begin to ebb. Good fortune.

Editor: The image is quite clear -- through misperception one initially rejects
something valuable which appears to be either repugnant or fantastic.
Psychologically, this suggests the idea of projection -- the assignment of our own
unconscious material to external phenomena. To "go forward to meet the rain”
is to make the proper connection -- to unite with the truth. In the I Ching rain
always means the union between heaven and earth, above and below, Self and
ego, thought and feeling, etc. The supreme union is a holy marriage, as described
in hexagram number eleven. Here it simply refers to making a connection --
getting the message.

These psychic elements lying behind the ego in the individual's
unconscious are projected, that is, they are reflected or mirrored
externally, in persons and things and situations which therefore acquire
for him a significance and power of attraction borrowed from the
unknown aspects of his own psyche.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. What you perceive as evil circumstances will in time reveal themselves
as fortunate.

B. Disparate elements in the psyche are about to come together. You
perceive disunion where none exists.

39 -- Impasse -- 39
HEXAGRAM NUMBER THIRTY-NINE –
IMPASSE

Other titles: Obstruction, The Symbol of Difficulty, Arresting Movement,
Trouble, Obstacles, Barrier, Halt, Halting, Limping, Afoot, “Sit Tight—Don’t
move” "One is surrounded by an underwater reef and should wait for
assistance." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: During an Impasse advantage is found in the southwest, disadvantage
in the northeast. See the great man. Firm correctness brings good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Obstruction. The southwest furthers. The northeast does
not further. It furthers one to see the great man. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: Trouble. The west and the south are favorable, but not the east and
north. [That is to say, if we try to forward our plans by proceeding in either of
those directions, we shall get bogged down or lost. It could also mean that we
should be driven to unvirtuous conduct.] It is advisable to see a great man. [We
should seek advice from someone of lofty moral stature and profound wisdom.]
Persistence in a righteous course brings good fortune.

Liu: Obstruction. The southwest is of benefit. The northeast -- no benefit. It
benefits one to visit a great man. To continue brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Limping, Harvesting: Western South. Not Harvesting:
Eastern North. Harvesting: visualizing Great People. Trial: significant. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of being weak, afflicted or
hampered. It emphasizes that going ahead even though haltingly is the
adequate way to handle it. (Sic) To be in accord with the time, you are told to:
limp!]

Shaughnessy: Afoot: Beneficial to the southwest, not beneficial to the
northeast; beneficial to see the great man; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): When halted, the southwest is beneficial, not the northeast. It is
profitable to see a great person; innocence is auspicious.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Cleary (2): When in trouble, it is beneficial to go southwest; it is not
beneficial to go northeast. It is beneficial to see a great person. Correctness leads
to good results.

Wu: Difficulty indicates that it will be advantageous in the southwest, but not
so in the northeast. There will be advantage to meet with the great man.
Auspiciousness will come with perseverance.

Hua-Ching Ni: The good direction is where there is no abyss or high
mountains, like the Southwest, but not the Northeast. One should go to the great
leader who can work with people in breaking through obstructions.

The Image

Legge: Water on the mountain -- the image of Impasse. The superior man
turns around to examine himself and cultivate his virtue.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Water on the mountain: the image of Obstruction. Thus
the superior man turns his attention to himself and molds his character.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes water upon a mountain. The Superior Man
cultivates virtue by bringing about a revolution within himself.

Liu: Water on the mountain symbolizes Obstruction. The superior man
reexamines himself and improves his character.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above mountain possessing stream. Limping. A
chun tzu uses reversing individuality to renovate actualizing-tao.
[Actualize-tao: Ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of
the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being
become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): There is water atop a mountain, halting. Thus do superior people
examine themselves and cultivate virtue.

Cleary (2): Water on a mountain – trouble. Developed people examine
themselves to cultivate virtue.

Wu: There is water on the mountain; this is Difficulty. Thus, the jun zi
examines his own person to polish his virtue.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Impasse means difficulty, with the trigram of Peril up
ahead. It is a wise man who can stop his advance at the first sign of danger.
Advantage in the southwest means that the dynamic line has advanced to the
central position. In the northeast, however, progress is halted. Seeing the great
39 -- Impasse -- 39

man insures progress and success. All of the lines except the first are in their
appropriate places, suggesting the firm correctness in which the regions of the
kingdom are brought to their natural order. Great indeed is the work to be done
during an Impasse.

Legge: Impasse is the symbol of incompetency in the feet and legs involving
difficulty in walking. Hence it represents a state of the kingdom which makes
government an arduous task. The figure teaches how to perform this task under
the prevailing circumstances.

The Judgment requires three things: the attention to place, the presence of
the great man, and the observance of firm correctness. According to King Wen's
arrangement of the trigrams, the southwest is occupied by the trigram of the
Earth, and the northeast by the trigram of the Mountain. The former is the fertile
lowland, the latter the mountain peaks; the former is easily traversed and held,
while the latter presents obstacles. Thus the attention to place becomes a
calculation of circumstances -- differentiating those that are promising from
those that are likely to fail.

The great man is the correctly dynamic ruler in the fifth place, with the
proper magnetic correlate in line two. However, favorable position and
circumstances, and the presence of the great man do not relieve us from the
observance of firm correctness -- this principle is consistent throughout the I
Ching.

Ch'eng-tzu says: "We see here a steep and difficult mountain, on the top of
which is water. Each trigram represents perilousness -- there is peril above and
below. Hence it shows the difficulties of the state." The application of the
symbolism is illustrated by the words of Mencius: "When our actions do not
realize our desires, we must turn inwards and examine ourselves in every
point."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Dissolve the polarities of an Impasse by seeking its most fertile
integration. Use your will in harmony with the principles of the Work.

The Superior Man seeks his center and refines his commitment.

Lines two and five of this difficult hexagram show those who struggle with
hardship; all of the other lines show images of an improper advance followed by a
proper return to a former position. Ritsema/Karcher's characterization of the
hexagram's overall meaning as an injunction to "(go) ahead even though
haltingly is the adequate way to handle (the situation)" is anomalous and at
variance with the general import of this figure. Legge's Confucian commentary is
more in keeping with its meaning: "It is a wise man who can stop his advance at
the first sign of danger."
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Legge also chooses an excellent paraphrase of the role of the superior man
in the Image with his quotation from Mencius: "When our actions do not realize
our desires, we must turn inwards and examine ourselves in every point." In
other words, the chances are good that the Impasse may be self-created, and
when the ego introspects with care the reasons usually become apparent.

It is not unknown at a certain stage of development for the ego,
overwhelmed with the enormity of the Work, to evade its responsibilities and
vainly try to return to the bliss of its former ignorance. At such times it soon
becomes clear that no matter what you attempt, success will be blocked: where
others succeed with ease, it will take you five times as much effort just to break
even. This Impasse is permanent until you reassume responsibility for the
Work. The following quotation is an allegory of this condition:

Yahweh Saboath says this: Reflect carefully how things have gone for
you. You have sown much and harvested little; you eat but never have
enough, drink but never have your fill, put on clothes but do not feel
warm. The wage earner gets his wages only to put them in a purse
riddled with holes ... The abundance you expected proved to be little.
When you brought the harvest in, my breath spoiled it. And why? It is
Yahweh Saboath who speaks. Because while my house lies in ruins you
are busy with your own, each one of you.
Haggai 1: 6-10

In one way or another, the Self will attain its intent. To ignore this hard
truth is to experience Impasse.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows that advance on the part of its subject will
lead to greater difficulties, while remaining stationary will afford ground for
praise.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Going leads to obstructions, coming meets with praise.

Blofeld: Going involves trouble; coming wins praise.

Liu: Going leads to obstruction. Coming brings praise. [People should remain in
their present positions.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Going Limping, coming praise.

Shaughnessy: Going afoot, coming in a cart.

Cleary (1): Going results in trouble, coming in praise.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Wu: Going forth is difficult; coming back is commendable.

Hua-Ching Ni: If one moves forward, obstruction will be encountered.
Honorable growth naturally comes to the one who keeps still.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The proper course is to wait. Wilhelm/Baynes: Because it
is right to wait. Blofeld: This passage stresses the advantage of waiting for some
time. Ritsema/Karcher: Proper to await indeed. Cleary (2): It is best to wait.
Wu: This means that waiting is in order.

Legge: Line one is magnetic in a dynamic place. If she advances she won't
be able to cope with the difficulties of the situation, but will be overwhelmed
by them. Let her wait for a more favorable time.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man forges ahead in the face of an impasse and is
overwhelmed by complications. He should wait for a favorable moment.

Wing: If you have met with an obstacle in your path, do not attempt to overcome
it. Instead, pull back from the situation and wait out the trouble. You will know
the right moment for action when you can move with ease.

Editor: Most translators use the words "going" and/or "coming" in every line of
this hexagram except number two. The respective differences between these two
words, "going" and "coming," are the differences between analysis and synthesis.
To "go" is to disperse, to create differences; to "come" is to return to center, to
reunite. Legge chooses the phrase "remaining stationary" in place of "coming,"
which is not quite the same idea, though it nicely stresses the idea of waiting
mentioned in the Confucian commentary.

The teaching without words and the benefit of taking no action are
without compare in the universe.
Lao-Tzu

A. “Don’t go there” -- "Wait and see."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the king's servant struggling with
difficulty on difficulty, and not with a view to her own advantage.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Wilhelm/Baynes: The king's servant is beset by obstruction upon obstruction,
but it is not his own fault.

Blofeld: The King's minister meets with difficulty upon difficulty, but through
no fault of his.

Liu: The king's officer meets many obstructions. It is not his fault.

Ritsema/Karcher: A king, a servant: Limping, Limping. In-no-way body's
anteriority.

Shaughnessy: The king's servant is so afoot; it is not the body's reason.

Cleary (1): King and vassal both faithful in spite of difficulty, not for their own
comfort.

Cleary (2): King and minister recognize trouble as trouble, not for personal
reasons.

Wu: A king’s minister is in the depths of difficulties and he disregards his
personal gains or losses.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the end no blame will attach to her. Wilhelm/Baynes:
But in the end there is no blame in this. Blofeld: This indicates that we shall be
free from blame to the very end (or in the end). Ritsema/Karcher: Completing
without surpassing indeed. Cleary (2): In the end there is no bitterness. Wu:
He will make no error in the end.

Legge: Line two is the correctly magnetic correlate of the ruler in line five. Here
we see that the moral value of conduct is independent of success or failure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: When duty bound, the man should seek out the danger and deliberately
face the opposition. This is especially important for officials in the government.

Wing: Because you serve a larger cause, whether you realize it or not, you are
obligated to meet Obstacles head on and overcome them. Even though this is
not advisable in ordinary affairs, this is the proper approach for extraordinary
causes. You will not be blamed.

Editor: The image depicts an ego doggedly coping with an imperfect universe to
further the Work. Since its subject is judged blameless for the difficulties
encountered, this line often refers to dealing with the illusions of others; it could
be a test.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Thus when Heaven is about to entrust a man with great work, it first
causes distress to his mind, belabors his muscles and frame, starves his
body, subjects him to want, and frustrates what he sets out to do. This is
to stimulate his ambition, strengthen his character, and increase his
capacity for doing what he could not do before.
Mencius

A. Cope as best you can with arduous circumstances. The Work is more
important than you are.

B. A selfless struggle ("Self-sacrifice").
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject advancing, but only to greater
difficulties. He remains stationary, and returns to his former associates.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Going leads to obstructions, hence he comes back.

Blofeld: To proceed would lead to trouble; therefore turn back!

Liu: Going leads to obstruction. Therefore he returns. He will be happy.
[Caution will prevent loss or injury.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Going Limping, coming reversing.

Shaughnessy: Going afoot, coming in return.

Cleary (1): Going leads to trouble. Come back.

Wu: Going forth is difficult; coming back is the opposite.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His associates, represented by the lower trigram, rejoice
in him. Wilhelm/Baynes: Those within rejoice over it. Blofeld: This passage
presages happiness for the women of the family (literally, happiness for those
within). [This could also be translated "internal happiness," but I think the
above rendering is what the author meant.] Ritsema/Karcher: Inside
rejoicing-in-it indeed. Cleary (2): Those inside will rejoice at this. Wu: Because
he will be greeted from inside.

Legge: Line three is dynamic, and in a place of strength, but his correlate sixth
line is magnetic, so that his advance would not be supported. He waits therefore
for a better time, and nurtures the two lines below, who naturally cling to him.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

On line three, K'ung Ying-ta says: "Of the three lines of the lower trigram only
the third is yang, above the two others who are of the yin nature. They cling to
him, and are represented as rejoicing."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Under certain circumstances, however, it is the duty of the man to refrain
from dealing with obstructions. Should the father, for example, fail to return from
his reckless venture, the dependents entrusted to his care may not survive.

Wing: If you abandon your present concerns in order to struggle with an
external obstacle, you are in danger of jeopardizing the security of those close to
you and, perhaps, undermining the structure of your life. It would be a good idea
to return to your center and reconsider your plan.

Editor: This line changes the hexagram to number eight, Holding Together,
the corresponding line of which states: "We see its subject seeking for union with
such as ought not to be associated with." This reinforces the idea in the present
case of returning from a dangerous position. There seems to be very little
difference between lines one and three -- as in the former, the psychological
correlations of "going" and "coming" with "analysis" (differentiation), and
"synthesis" (union), are sometimes useful.

Much that I sought, I could not find;
Much that I found, I could not bind;
Much that I bound, I could not free;
Much that I freed returned to me.
-- L.W. Dodd

A. Avoid adversity by returning to a former alliance, attitude or discipline.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject advancing, but only to
greater difficulties. She remains stationary, and unites with the line above.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Going leads to obstructions, coming leads to union.

Blofeld: To proceed would lead to trouble, whereas those coming will forge
useful connections.

Liu: Going leads to obstruction. Coming brings about unity.

Ritsema/Karcher: Going Limping, coming continuity.

Shaughnessy: Going afoot, coming connected.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

Cleary (1): Going leads to trouble; come form associations.

Cleary (2): Going means trouble; coming back brings company.

Wu: Going forth is difficult; coming back will find an associate.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: To advance will only be to encounter greater difficulties; she
remains stationary, and unites with the line above who is in his proper place and
has the ruler's stability. Wilhelm/Baynes: In the appropriate place one finds
support. Blofeld: Because this line is suitably placed and possesses solidity.
Ritsema/Karcher: Appropriate situation, substance indeed. Cleary (2): One’s
position is solidified. Wu: What is in place is solid.

Legge: Line four is magnetic, and though in her proper place, she can do very
little by herself. She is immediately below the king or great man however, and
cultivates her loyal attachment, waiting for the time when she shall be required to
act.
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man charges ahead, only to fall back because of insufficient strength.
He needs to gather trustworthy associates for the venture before it can succeed.

Wing: In order to meet the challenge and overcome Obstacles facing you, you
must rely upon someone who can help you. You will need a unified approach,
employing the help of another person or an organization. A single-handed
maneuver will surely fail. Hold back and unite.

Editor: Blofeld's rendering of "union with the line above" in terms of "forging
useful connections" is sometimes an apt interpretation in contemporary idiom.
Psychologically it can refer to reuniting with your essence via meditation on the
principles of the Work. Note that both lines 4 and 6 are magnetic, and both are
counseled to focus on the 5th line ruler: dimensionally, the inner Self: the one
who is both "above" and "inside." The structure of the upper trigram symbolizes
these relationships in the context of Impasse.

They also serve who only stand and wait.
Milton

A. Remain in place and develop your higher potential.
39 -- Impasse -- 39
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject struggling with the greatest
difficulties, while friends are coming to help him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In the midst of the greatest obstructions, friends come.

Blofeld: In the midst of severe trouble, friends (or a friend) arrive.

Liu: One meets great obstruction. Friends come. [You can expect help in your
undertakings and good fortune in everything.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The great Limping, partnering coming.

Shaughnessy: Greatly afoot, the friend comes.

Cleary (1): Great trouble; a companion comes.

Cleary (2): In great trouble, companions come.

Wu: There is great difficulty. Friends will come.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is in the central position and possesses the requisite
virtue. Wilhelm/Baynes: For they are ruled by the central position. Blofeld:
This is indicated by the line's central position in the upper trigram. Ritsema/
Karcher: Using centering articulating indeed. Cleary (2): Because of balance
and moderation. Wu: The difficulty will be assuaged around the center.

Legge: Line five is the king, the man great and strong. He can cope with the
difficulties, and his "friends" are his correlate line two and the other two lines of
the lower trigram who also give their help.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man meets the obstruction head-on in an emergency. His spirit attracts
able helpers.

Wing: Even in the most desperate struggles, your spirit alone will attract others.
This co-operation will bring you success in your endeavors. Obstacles will give
way.

Editor: The image suggests an impasse about to be resolved by forces currently
outside your sphere of awareness.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

I was living in a constant state of tension; often I felt as if gigantic blocks
of stone were tumbling down upon me. One thunderstorm followed
another. My enduring these storms was a question of brute strength.
Others have been shattered by them -- Nietzsche, and Holderlin, and
many others. But there was a demonic strength in me, and from the
beginning there was no doubt in my mind that I must find the meaning
of what I was experiencing in these fantasies. When I endured these
assaults of the unconscious I had an unswerving conviction that I was
obeying a higher will, and that feeling continued to uphold me until I had
mastered the task.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. Forces for integration are on the threshold of awareness.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject going forward, only to increase
the difficulties, while her remaining stationary will be productive of great merit.
There will be good fortune, and it will be advantageous to meet with the great
man.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Going leads to obstructions, coming leads to great good
fortune. It furthers one to see the great man.

Blofeld: To proceed would lead to trouble; coming will produce excellent
results. It is advisable to see a great man. [We should seek advice from someone
of lofty moral stature and profound wisdom.]

Liu: Going leads to obstruction. Coming brings great events. Good fortune. It is
beneficial to see a great man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Going Limping, coming ripening. Significant.
Harvesting: visualizing Great People.

Shaughnessy: Going afoot, coming with swelled head; auspicious; beneficial to
see a great man.

Cleary (1): Going is trouble, coming is great. For good results, it is beneficial to
see a great person.

Wu: Going forth is difficult; coming back is great. Good fortune. It will be
advantageous to see the great man.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her aim is to assist the subject of the line inside of her. By
39 -- Impasse -- 39

her course she follows that noble Lord of the figure. Wilhelm/Baynes: For the
will is directed to inner things. For thus does one follow a man of rank. Blofeld:
The first sentence points to directing the will inwards. The other sentence is an
injunction to submit ourselves to someone truly noble. Ritsema/Karcher:
Purpose located inside indeed. Using adhering-to valuing indeed. Cleary (2):
The aim is within. By following what is valuable. Wu: His goals are directed
inward. He can get his advices from the highly placed.

Legge: The action of the hexagram is over -- where can the magnetic sixth line
go? Let her abide where she is, and serve the great man immediately below her.
So shall she also be great -- in meritorious action at least. "The line inside of her"
refers to the ruler in line five.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man cannot go forward. He needs to remain where he is and serve the
great man in order to achieve meritorious deeds.

Wing: Although it seems that you may ignore the turmoil around you and
proceed with your own affairs, you will not be able to do so. You will inexorably
be drawn into the struggle. Look to the paths of the wise for guidance in this
matter. This brings good fortune to all concerned.

Editor: The third and sixth lines are proper correlates and very similar in
content. Wilhelm comments that the magnetic line six and its dynamic correlate
in line three unite to support the dynamic fifth line ruler ("that noble Lord of the
figure"). Legge's commentary misses this subtle distinction. The psychological
message is to conjoin your thoughts and feelings and re-attune yourself to the
principles of the Work. To assist the ruler "inside of us," or direct the will to
"inner things," is to serve the intent of the Self -- a repetition of the counsel in the
Judgment to "see the great man."

The wisdom of the "unconscious" stratum is not only different from but in
certain respects even superior to our ego consciousness. While the
conscious ego is normally unfamiliar and unaware of this hidden
stratum, the unconscious objective psyche is evidently aware of the ego,
its intentions and activities. We have learned through our work with
dreams that the "unconscious" is also aware of facts and connections
beyond the ego’s scope and capacity to tap, and which are relevant to the
past, present and future.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing

A. Forces abdicate their autonomy to break an impasse by serving a
greater good.

B. The work is taking place on inner planes -- cease your activity and allow
the changes to fulfill themselves.
39 -- Impasse -- 39

C. “Don’t go there.” Seek inner guidance -- by focusing on the Self and the
principles of the Work, one attains success.

D. Nothing external can be accomplished. Instead, venture inward and
work on your attitudes, beliefs or expectations.

40 -- Liberation -- 40
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY –
LIBERATION

Other titles: Deliverance, The Symbol of Loosening, Release, Eliminating
Obstacles, Taking-apart, Untangled, Solution, Dissolution, Relief, Unloose,
Release of Tension

Judgment

Legge: Liberation finds advantage in the southwest. When the operation is
completed, a return to stability brings good fortune. If operations are
incomplete, it is best to finish them quickly.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Deliverance. The southwest furthers. If there is no longer
anything (Sic) where one has to go, return brings good fortune. If there is still
something (Sic) where one has to go, hastening brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Release. The west and south are favorable. Those with nothing to gain
from going forward will find good fortune by turning back; those who do have
much to gain from going forward must hasten to be sure of doing well. [This is
not a time to stay where we are. If we have no good reason to advance, it is best
to retreat.]

Liu: Liberation. The southwest benefits. If there is nothing for one where one
has to go, then returning brings good fortune. If there is something in a place
where one can go, then going quickly leads to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Taking-apart. Harvesting: Western South. Without a
place to go: one's coming return significant. Possessing directed going: Daybreak
significant. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of reflection and
release from tension. It emphasizes that analyzing and understanding things in
order to be delivered from compulsion is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Untangled: Beneficial to the southwest; there is nowhere to
go; his coming in return is auspicious; there is someplace to go to spend the
night; auspicious.

Cleary (1): For liberation, the southwest is beneficial. When going nowhere,
the return brings good fortune; when going somewhere, promptness brings good
fortune.
40 -- Liberation -- 40

Cleary (2): For solution, the southwest is beneficial. Going nowhere, coming
back is fortunate, etc.

Wu: Relief indicates advantage in the southwest. If he undertakes to do
something without a cause, it will be auspicious for him to return to his former
station. If he undertakes to do something with a cause, it will be auspicious for
him to do it early.

The Image

Legge: Liberation shows a thunderstorm clearing the atmosphere. The
superior man, in accordance with this, forgives errors and deals gently with
crimes.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder and rain set in: the image of Deliverance. Thus
the superior man pardons mistakes and forgives misdeeds.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder and rain bringing release. The
Superior Man tends to forgive wrongs and deals leniently with crimes. [The
component trigrams suggest that a certain amount of forceful action is
required.]

Liu: Thunder and rain come, symbolizing Liberation. The superior man
forgives errors and pardons criminals.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder, rain, arousing. Taking-apart. A chun tzu uses
forgiving excess to pardon offenses.

Cleary (1): Thunder and rain act, dissolving. Thus do superior people forgive
faults and pardon crimes.

Cleary (2): Thunder and rain – solution. Etc.

Wu: There come thunder and rain; this is Relief. Thus the jun zi pardons
inadvertent transgressors and extenuates (Sic) criminal offenders.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Liberation shows the trigram of Movement above the
trigram of Danger -- through movement there is an escape from peril. An early
movement to the southwest wins the allegiance of the masses and returns the
state to normalcy and equilibrium. When heaven and earth are freed from the
grasp of winter, we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the
fruit-producing vegetation begin to open. Great indeed are the phenomena in the
time of Liberation.
40 -- Liberation -- 40

Legge: The written Chinese character for Liberation is the symbol of
unloosing -- untying a knot or unraveling a complication. This hexagram denotes
a condition in which the obstruction and difficulty of the preceding figure have
been removed. The lesson is how this new and better state of the kingdom should
be dealt with. If no tasks remain to be completed, the sooner things resume their
normal course the better. If further operations are necessary, let them be
accomplished without delay. The K'ang-hsi editors say that moving to the south
and west is the same as returning to normality.

Thunder and rain clear the atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression is
relieved. The images of springtime in the Confucian commentary refer to the
gentle policy of a conquering ruler who forgives the opposition of those who cease
to offer resistance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Do what obviously needs to be done and return to stability as soon
as possible.

The Superior Man forgives, forgets, and bears no grudges. (i.e., Stability is
more important than fixing blame or haggling over who is right.)

If the thirty-ninth hexagram of Impasse is turned upside down it
becomes the fortieth hexagram of Liberation or Deliverance. The two figures
represent opposite situations: if Impasse creates tension, then Liberation
releases it. The upper trigram of Movement ascends to escape from the lower
trigram of Danger, giving us an unambiguous image of freedom and relief.

Apart from all personification, the whole of space in which life finds itself
has a malevolently spiritual character, and the "demons" themselves are
as much spatial realms as they are persons. To overcome them is the
same thing as to pass through them, and in breaking through their
boundaries this passage at the same time breaks their power and
achieves the liberation from the magic of their sphere.
H. Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion

Legge's commentary in the preceding hexagram explains that the
"southwest" is the direction of "earth," the fertile lowland where life is natural
and uncontrived. Confucius tells us here that an early move in this direction will
win the "allegiance of the masses." Psychologically interpreted, this refers to the
inner kingdom of the psyche, where “the masses” are the drives, emotions and
archetypal complexes which make up our being. The symbolism suggests a
conscious freeing up of inner tension.

These forces, therefore, must not be left to run wild, but should be
disposed of in harmless ways or, better still, used for constructive

40 -- Liberation -- 40

purposes: creative activities of various kinds; the rebuilding of our
personality, contributing to our Psychosynthesis.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows that its subject will commit no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Without blame.

Blofeld: No error!

Liu: No blame. [If you receive this line you can expect success in your
undertakings.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Without fault.

Shaughnessy: There is no trouble.

Cleary (1): No blame.

Wu: No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The dynamic fourth line and the magnetic first line are in
correlation. We judge rightly in saying that its subject will commit no error.
Wilhelm/Baynes: On the border between firm and yielding there should be no
blame. Blofeld: the conjunction of yielding and firm (namely, lines one and
two) (Sic) implies freedom from error. Ritsema/Karcher: Solid and supple's
border. Righteous, without fault indeed. Cleary (2): At the border of hard and
soft, etc. Wu: Where the strong-minded and the softhearted meet, there is on
balance no error.

Legge: There is a magnetic line instead of a dynamic one in the first place, but
this is compensated for by her dynamic fourth line correlate.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is freed from obstacles and is recuperating in peace.

Wing: You have surmounted the difficulties in your current endeavor. The path
has been cleared and progress will continue. Use this time to consolidate your
position.
40 -- Liberation -- 40

Editor: Blofeld's interpretation of the Confucian commentary is anomalous --
correctness is found in the tension between lines one and four (not one and two).
To be magnetic in a dynamic place and dynamic in a magnetic place suggests a
continuous adjustment to changing circumstances. Wilhelm's Confucian
commentary provides a good image of this kind of adaptation: "On the border
between firm and yielding there should be no blame." Sometimes this line can
mean a confirmation of a hypothesis, speculation or attitude -- it is saying
"affirmative" to your query.

Fortunate, indeed, is the man who takes exactly the right measure of
himself, and holds a just balance between what he can acquire and what
he can use, be it great or be it small.
-- P.M. Latham

A. A position of dynamic (as opposed to static) balance between opposing
forces is free of error.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject catch, in hunting, three
foxes, and obtain the yellow (golden) arrows. With firm correctness there will be
good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One kills three foxes in the field and receives a yellow arrow.
Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: With one yellow arrow, he killed three foxes in the field. [Three birds
with one stone.] Righteous persistence will bring good fortune.

Liu: One catches three foxes in the field and gains a yellow (golden) arrow. To
continue brings good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The fields, catching three foxes. Acquiring a yellow arrow.
Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: In the fields bagging three foxes, and getting a yellow arrowhead;
determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Catching three foxes on a hunt, having golden arrows, correctness
brings good fortune.

Cleary (2): Catching the third fox on a hunt, finding a yellow arrow, etc.

Wu: The hunter bags three foxes and finds a yellow arrow. It will be auspicious
with perseverance.
40 -- Liberation -- 40
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is because he holds the due mean.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune is due to its attaining the middle way.
Blofeld: The good fortune of being able to steer a middle course. Ritsema/
Karcher: Acquiring centering tao indeed. Cleary (2): Attaining the way of
balance. Wu: Because he takes a middle road.

Legge: The second line is dynamic, but the place is magnetic, so his strength is
tempered. As the correlate of the ruler in line five, he is an officer striving to
bring about deliverance and pacify the subdued kingdom. He is compared to a
hunter who disposes of inferior men, represented by the three foxes. He receives
the yellow arrows, the instruments of war or hunting, whose color is correct and
whose form is straight. The K'ang-hsi editors say that while straight-
forwardness, symbolized by the arrows, is the first duty of an officer, if he doesn't
temper that quality by pursuing the due mean, symbolized by their yellow color,
and instead proceeds by main force to remove what is evil, he will provoke
indignation and rebellion.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man proceeds at a proper pace and with moderation to remove the
designing individuals, who influence the ruler through flattery and obstruct
public progress.

Wing: The situation may be in the hands of inferior individuals who use
unworthy methods to influence those in authority. You must now be particularly
straightforward and virtuous while discrediting their efforts. Good fortune.

Editor: Arrow: The arrow has associations similar to the sword – the
discriminating function. To shoot an arrow into the heart of the matter is to
pierce its essence, to comprehend it completely. Yellow: Color of the mean, of
the sun – suggests wisdom which comes from clarity: balanced perception. Fox:
Common Asian symbol for evil, especially its wily or tricky aspects. Three:
Symbol of dialectical synthesis or completion, as is the concept of the mean. The
line images a situation in which careful discrimination perceives the elements of
a problem.

Therefore, the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance
should be slashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O
Bharata, stand and fight.
Bhagavad-Gita

A. Balanced insight into the situation differentiates and eliminates
harmful elements.

B. Bull’s-eye! – your suspicions are confirmed.
40 -- Liberation -- 40
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows a porter with his burden, yet riding in a
carriage. He will only tempt robbers to attack him. However firm and correct he
may try to be, there will be cause for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If a man carries a burden on his back and nonetheless rides
in a carriage, he thereby encourages robbers to draw near. Perseverance leads to
humiliation.

Blofeld: Traveling with both luggage-bearers and a carriage, he attracted the
attention of robbers. To persist would bring misfortune. [This could mean that
someone bearing luggage on his back rides in a carriage. In any case, the
Chinese additional commentaries explain that the passage refers to those who
usurp privileges to which they are not entitled by rank or merit.]

Liu: A man carries goods on his back and rides in a carriage – thus invites
robbers to come. To continue brings humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bearing, moreover riding. Involving outlawry
culminating. Trial: abashment.

Shaughnessy: Carrying on the back and riding in a cart brings robbers to
arrive; determination is distressful.

Cleary (1): Riding bearing a burden causes enemies to arrive. Even being
righteous one is humiliated.

Cleary (2): Carrying and riding brings on enemies. It is right to be humiliated.

Wu: A man bearing a load rides in a carriage. What he swaggers is conducive to
robbery. Even though he does nothing wrong, he will be humiliated.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: For a porter with his burden to be riding in a carriage is a
thing to be ashamed of. It is he himself that tempts the robbers to come. On
whom besides can we lay the blame? Wilhelm/Baynes: He should really be
ashamed of himself. When I myself thus attract robbers, on whom shall I lay the
blame? Blofeld: Moreover, his using both of them was shameful. If I were to
act thus and bring robbers down on me, who but myself would be to blame?
Ritsema/Karcher: Truly permitting the demoniac indeed. Originating-from
my involving arms. Furthermore whose fault indeed. Cleary (2): Carrying and
riding are both disgraceful. One brings attack by oneself – who else is to blame?
40 -- Liberation -- 40

Wu: It is a shame for a bearer to ride in a carriage. He exposes himself to
robbery. Who else is to be blamed?

The Master said: The makers of the I Ching may be said to have
known the philosophy of robbery. The I Ching says, "He is a burden-bearer,
and yet rides in a carriage, thereby exciting robbers to attack him." Burden-
bearing is the business of an inferior man. A carriage is the vehicle of a
gentleman. When an inferior man rides in the vehicle of a gentleman, robbers
will think of taking it from him. When one is insolent to those above him, and
oppressive to those below, robbers will wish to attack him. Careless laying up of
things excites to robbery, as a woman's adorning of herself excites to lust. What
the I Ching says about the burden-bearer's riding in a carriage, and exciting
robbers to attack him shows how robbery is called out.

Legge: The third line is magnetic where it should be dynamic. In the top place of
the lower trigram it suggests the idea of a porter riding in a carriage. People will
say: "How did he get there? The things cannot be his own." Therefore robbers
will attack and plunder him since he can't protect himself or accomplish anything
good.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man has obtained material goods and comfort and seeks a life of ease
which does not suit his nature. Like a woman's self-adornment which excites to
lust, this way of life merely invites robbers and leads to humiliation.

Wing: You have been able to assume a somewhat powerful position, which
you do not know how to control. You pretend to be something that you are not.
This invites envy. If you continue in this way you will suffer humiliation at the
hands of others who would usurp your position.

Editor: Receiving this line can be a reprimand for an unworthy attitude. It
shows one who aspires beyond his station, or who incorrectly seeks an easy
solution to his problems. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes
number thirty-two, Consistency, the corresponding line of which begins:
"Shows one who does not constantly maintain his virtue..." The idea is that a
desire to move ahead quickly tempts one into an improper response to the
situation at hand. Sometimes the context of the question can suggest that the
"vehicle" (carriage) is the oracle itself -- you want it to answer a question you can
figure out for yourself. The porter's burden is an obvious responsibility or duty.
The robbers are anything that would harm the Work.

The acceptance of the need to relate to a power or powers beyond our
personal control and rational comprehension does not necessitate, indeed
does not even permit, abandonment of our personal responsibility but
rather requires of us that in the domain of the personal life assigned to us

40 -- Liberation -- 40

our own responsibility must be exerted to the limits.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. "There's no such thing as a free lunch." Get your head out of the clouds
and assume your responsibilities.

B. Did you expect a spiritual helicopter to take you to the top of the
mountain?
Line-4

Legge: To the subject of the fourth line, dynamic, it is said: "Remove your
toes. Friends will then come, and there will be mutual confidence between you."

Wilhelm/Baynes: Deliver yourself from your great toe. Then the companion
comes, and him you can trust.

Blofeld: A fumbled release. Put your trust in the friend(s) who will come. ["A
fumbled release" is the result of my attempt to make something of three Chinese
words -- "release" and "thumb" (or "big toe") joined by a grammatical particle
with various possible meanings. Whether my guess is right or not, the
commentary on the line makes it clear that the omen is not a fortunate one.
Happily, an awkward situation will be relieved by the arrival of a friend (or
friends).]

Liu: Loosen your big toe. When your friend comes, you can trust each other.

Ritsema/Karcher: Taking-apart and-also the thumbs. Partnering
culminating, splitting-off conforming.

Shaughnessy: Untangling his hemlock; a friend arrives and returns this.

Cleary (1): Releasing your big toe, when the companion comes, then trust.

Cleary (2): Remove your big toe. When a companion comes, then you trust.

Wu: He unties his big toes. This will bring the trust of his friends.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The places of this line and of the third and first are all
inappropriate to them. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the appropriate one.
Blofeld: A fumbled release is indicated by the unsuitable position of this line.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet an appropriate situation indeed. Cleary (2): You
are not yet in the right position. Wu: Because he is out of place.
40 -- Liberation -- 40

Legge: Line four is dynamic in a magnetic place, and his correlate is magnetic in
a dynamic place. Such a union will not be productive of good. In the symbolism
line one becomes the toe of line four. The K'ang-hsi editors say that "Line four is
neither central nor in his correct place. He has line one for a correlate and line
three for his close associate -- both of whom are magnetic in dynamic places.
Hence it is said that they are all in places inappropriate to them."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man removes the inferior people who have attached themselves to him
and have even become indispensable in some respects. This is a necessary
prelude to great attainments. Their departure will enable him to cultivate friends
with similar views and mutual confidence.

Wing: There are people who attach themselves to you for reasons of their own.
This is a parasitic relationship, which may become habitual. You should liberate
yourself from this kind of entanglement, since it repels others who might be
valuable allies in your endeavors.

Editor: The respective meanings of lines one and four are derived from their
correlation with each other. Note that this correlation is seen as favorable to line
one, but unfavorable to line four. There are seven lines in the I Ching which
mention toes, and all except the present one are first lines. In this case the toe
referred to is the first line, which is magnetic in a dynamic place during a time of
liberation from peril or stagnation. This suggests that from the point of view of
line four, his magnetic correlate in the first place is a liability to be discarded. As
regards the immanent assistance of "friends," Wilhelm comments that "the
present line and the [dynamic line] in the second place are friends of kindred
nature, jointly rendering loyal help to the ruler in the fifth place." Since line two
is the only other dynamic line in the hexagram and is portrayed as a "hunter who
disposes of inferior men," such help is obviously advantageous. As confusing as
all this seems to be, the essential idea is clear enough: free yourself of a
compulsion or entanglement in order to obtain help. (A toe either gives us the
impetus to move or obstructs movement when we stumble over it.) Perhaps it
represents a timid, conservative or over-cautious attitude which is holding us
back.

It takes a great leap of imagination to conceive of this ego position. We
are so much in the habit of taking our conscious selves for granted that
our sense of ourselves seems to us the primary fact from which all other
experiences arise merely secondarily. We find it difficult to regard the
subjective experience of "I" as in any way secondary, as something
through which some objective "other" -- namely, a "not-I," an objective
psychic stratum -- brings itself to experience as consciousness, as a focal
point of the total field in terms of space and time.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

40 -- Liberation -- 40

A. Liberate yourself from egotism and allow the trustworthy insights of the
Self to guide you.

B. Control your compulsive fear or anxiety and success will come of itself.

C. The image suggests that perhaps you have fallen in with bad company –
abandon inferior influences.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the superior man (the ruler) executing his
function of removing whatever is injurious to the idea of liberation, in which case
there will be good fortune, and confidence in him will be shown even by the
inferior men.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If only the superior man can deliver himself, it brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: Only the Superior Man brings release. Good fortune! It is up to lesser
men to put their trust in him. [This could also mean "He has confidence in lesser
men."]

Liu: Only the superior man can liberate himself from entanglement. Good
fortune. Thus the inferior man trusts him.

Ritsema/Karcher: A chun tzu holding-fast possesses Taking- apart.
Significant. Possessing conformity, tending-towards Small People.

Shaughnessy: The gentleman only is untangled; auspicious; there is a return
among the little men.

Cleary (1): In this the superior person has liberation, which is fortunate; there is
earnestness in regard to the inferior person.

Cleary (2): The developed person has a solution, which is fortunate. There is
sincerity toward a petty person.

Wu: The jun zi is relieved of what has implicated him. This is auspicious. It
would be a lesson to the little men.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: When he removes the barriers to liberation the inferior
men will of themselves retire. Wilhelm/Baynes: The superior man delivers
himself, because inferior men then retreat. Blofeld: But when the Superior Man
offers them release, they take to their heels. [Perhaps this means the true release
40 -- Liberation -- 40

involves release from selfishness -- a lesson which men of little merit have no
desire to learn!] Ritsema/Karcher: Small People withdrawing indeed. Cleary
(2): The developed person has a solution. The petty person withdraws. Wu: The
jun zi is relieved and the little men will resign.

Legge: Line five is magnetic in a dynamic place, but the place is that of the ruler,
whose duty is to promote liberation by removing all barriers to harmony within
the kingdom -- especially all the inferior men symbolized by the divided lines. He
can do this with the help of his dynamic correlate in the second line. Then even
the inferior men will change their ways, and conform to his will. "The inferior
men retire" means that believing in the sincerity of the ruler's determination to
remove all evil men, they either retire of themselves or strive to conform to his
wishes.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man drives away inferior people through an inner resolve and makes a
complete mental and spiritual break. They recognize his earnestness, withdraw of
their own accord, and even extend begrudging approval.

Wing: In order to eliminate an inferior habit or situation you must first make an
inner resolve to overcome it. Only you can save yourself. Once you are liberated,
inferior elements will retreat into the background and you will win the respect
you deserve. Good fortune.

Editor: The context of the line does not lend itself to the usual gender
symbolism used in this book. Wilhelm renders this in a conditional sense: "If
only the superior man can deliver himself..." Blofeld and Liu say that "only the
superior man" can liberate himself. There is the implication that your
"superiority" may be in question. You are challenged to take appropriate action
to liberate yourself from your fetters. This will be in accordance with the ruler's
central place and an active balancing of forces as imaged in the relationship with
the second line correlate.

For when the body gets out of equilibrium, we look to which side it
inclines in becoming unbalanced, and then oppose it with its contrary
until it returns to equilibrium. When it is in equilibrium, we remove that
counterbalance and revert to that which keeps the body in equilibrium.
We act in a similar manner with regard to moral habits.
Maimonides

A. Identify and eliminate the problem or limiting belief. Clear the psyche
of inhibitions.

B. If you stop indulging your weaknesses they will eventually leave you
alone.
40 -- Liberation -- 40
Line-6

Legge: In the sixth line, magnetic, we see a feudal prince with his bow shooting
at a falcon on the top of a high wall, and hitting it. The effect of this action will be
in every way advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall. He kills it.
Everything serves to further.

Blofeld: The prince shot an arrow and killed a hawk perching on a high wall.
Everything is favorable!

Liu: A duke shoots a hawk on the high wall and catches it. Everything is
beneficial.

Ritsema/Karcher: A prince avails-of shooting a hawk, tending- towards the
high rampart's above. Without not Harvesting: catching it.

Shaughnessy: The duke herewith shoots a hawk on the top of a high wall,
bagging it; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall and gets it, to the benefit
of all.

Wu: The duke aims his arrow at a hawk perching on a high city wall. He bags the
predator. Nothing is disadvantageous.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Thus he removes the promoters of rebellion. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Thereby he delivers himself from those who resist. Blofeld: This
means that he was able to liberate himself from perverse men. Ritsema/
Karcher: Using Taking- apart rebelling indeed. Cleary (2): The lord shoots
the hawk to solve the conflict. Wu: To relieve the threat of sedition.

The Master said: "The falcon is a bird of prey; the bow and arrow is a
weapon of war; the shooter is a man. The superior man keeps his weapon
concealed about his person, and waits for the proper time to move; doing this,
how should his movement be other than successful? There is nothing to fetter or
embarrass movement, and hence when he comes forth, he succeeds in his object.
The language speaks of movement when the instrument necessary to it is ready
and perfect."

Legge: Line six is the highest line in the figure, but not the place of the ruler.
Hence he appears as a feudal duke, who carries out the idea of the figure against
inferior men.
40 -- Liberation -- 40
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Using hitherto concealed, ready, and perfect instruments, the man removes
the powerful promoter of obstruction and rebellion.

Wing: Prepare yourself to forcefully dispense with a great adversary. This is
done with careful planning and clever timing. This is a formidable enemy so you
must be constantly alert. When you have removed this obstacle to your progress,
everything that you attempt will succeed.

Editor: The line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. Prince:
Minor official -- the ego. Bow: The tension and release of aimed power --
conceptualization. Arrow: Perception, realization, that which pierces the heart of
the matter. Hawk/Falcon: A predator bird. Swedenborg says: "Birds signify
such things as relate to the understanding, and thence to thought and
deliberation." The hawk, then, is aggressive, dangerous thinking. Confucius calls
him a "promoter of rebellion," hence: undisciplined thinking, the source of an
illusion. Wall: From the outside, it defines a space, outlines a perimeter; from the
inside, it is protection from what lies outside: a division between one state or
condition and another. A "high" wall suggests the realm of thought, ideas. The
wall is the threshold, and the falcon is the guardian of the threshold.

Now the mind flies forth like an arrow from a cross-bow, to be the arbiter
of right and wrong. Now it stays behind as if sworn to an oath, to hold
on to what it has secured.
Chuangtse

In this quote from Chuangtse, the first sentence describes the action of the
prince, and the second sentence describes the function of the threshold guardian
-- in this case the hawk. The line suggests the elimination of an illusion which
thereby liberates one to explore a whole new realm of thought or experience.

A. Attain liberation by identifying and eliminating a dangerous entrenched
thought, idea, attitude, concept or limiting belief which has been preventing a
resolution of the matter at hand.

41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-ONE --
COMPENSATING SACRIFICE

Other titles: Decrease, The Symbol of Lessening, Loss, Diminishing,
Reduction, Diminution of Excesses, Decline, Bringing into Balance, Dynamic
Balance, Sacrifice, "Not necessarily material loss. Can mean decreasing the
lower self to increase the higher." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Compensating Sacrifice means that sincerely maintained rectitude
brings great success. Action is appropriate if one's sacrifice is sincere -- even two
baskets of grain, though there be nothing else, may be offered.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Decrease combined with sincerity brings about supreme
good fortune without blame. One may be persevering in this. It furthers one to
undertake something. How is this to be carried out? One may use two small
bowls for the sacrifice.

Blofeld: Loss accompanied by confidence -- sublime good fortune and no
error! It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination). If there is doubt
as to what to use for the sacrifice, two small bowls will suffice.

Liu: Decrease with sincerity: great good fortune, no blame. One may continue.
It is beneficial to go somewhere. How can this (decrease with sincerity) be done?
One may use two bamboo containers of grain for a sacrifice.

Ritsema/Karcher: Diminishing, possessing conformity. Spring significant.
Without fault, permitting Trial. Harvesting: possessing directed going. Asking-
why: having availing of. Two platters permit availing-of presenting. [This
hexagram describes your situation in terms of sacrifice and loss. It emphasizes
that lessening yourself and decreasing your involvements is the adequate way
to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: There is a return; prime auspiciousness; there is no trouble. It
can be determined. Beneficial to have someplace to go. Why use two tureens; you
can use aromatic grass.

Cleary (1): Reduction with sincerity is very auspicious, impeccable. It should
be correct. It is beneficial to go somewhere. What is the use of the two bowls?
They can be used to receive.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Cleary (2): ... It is beneficial to have somewhere to go, etc ... They can be used
for presentation.

Wu: Loss indicates that with confidence there will be great fortune, no error,
perseverance, and advantage to have undertakings. What to use in offerings? Two
boxes of grain are adequate.

The Image

Legge: The image of a mountain and beneath it the waters of a marsh form
Compensating Sacrifice. The superior man, in accordance with this, restrains
his wrath and represses his desires.

Wilhelm/Baynes: At the foot of the mountain, the lake: the image of
Decrease. Thus the superior man controls his anger and restrains his instincts.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a marshy lake at the foot of a mountain. The
Superior Man keeps his anger under control and is moderate in his desires.

Liu: The lake beside the mountain symbolizes Decrease. The superior man
curbs his indignation and restricts his desires.

Ritsema/Karcher: Below mountain possessing marsh. Diminishing. A chun
tzu uses curbing anger to block the appetites.

Cleary (1): There is a lake under a mountain, reducing it. Thus does the
superior person eliminate wrath and cupidity.

Cleary (2): Lake below a mountain – Reducing. Thus do developed people
eliminate anger and greed.

Wu: There is a marsh below the mountain; this is Loss. Thus the jun zi mitigates
his anger and restrains his desires.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Compensating Sacrifice the lower trigram is
diminished to increase the upper, and the flow is upward. The two baskets of
grain accord with the time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished
and the weak strengthened. Decrease and increase, overflowing and emptiness,
take place in harmony with the demands of the time.

Legge: Ch'eng-tzu says: "Every diminution and repression of what we have in
excess to bring it into accordance with right and reason is comprehended under
Compensating Sacrifice. If there is sincerity in doing this it will lead to
success and happiness, and even if the offering is small, yet it will be accepted."
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

The K'ang-hsi editors say: "What is meant by diminishing in this
hexagram is the regulation of expenditure or contribution according to the time.
This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth, and in a state
according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. If one supplements
the insufficiency of his offering with the abundance of his sincerity, the
insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised."

The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapor to bedew the hill
above it, and thus increase its verdure. What is taken from the marsh gives
increase to the hill.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: A sacrifice creates equilibrium.

The Superior Man sacrifices his appetites to a higher principle.

The traditional name for this hexagram is Decrease, but the lines and
commentary all describe a compensating exchange of forces to attain
equilibrium. The idea of "sacrifice" is mentioned in the Judgment, and that also
might make a good title, though the image of two baskets of grain suggests a
balancing scale: a "compensating" device. In this hexagram, the flow of energy
moves from below upwards -- the waters of the lake or marsh are dispersed to
enrich the mountain. In psychological terms we think of the ego sacrificing or
decreasing its autonomy to achieve psychic equilibrium with the Self: we forfeit
something valuable to obtain something even more valuable. Without this quid
pro quo, the concept of sacrifice is meaningless and irrational.

A sacrifice is meant to be a loss, so that one may be sure that the egoistic
claim no longer exists. Therefore the gift should be given as if it were
being destroyed. But since the gift represents myself, I have in that case
destroyed myself, given myself away without expectation of return. Yet,
looked at in another way, this intentional loss is also a gain, for if you
can give yourself it proves that you possess yourself. Nobody can give
what he has not got.
Jung -- Transformation Symbolism in the Mass

Compare the Image message from hexagram number 15, Temperance
with the notion of a compensating balance: "The superior man, in accordance
with this, diminishes his excesses to augment his insufficiencies, thus creating a
just balance." We are reminded of another "Temperance" -- the 14th Arcanum of
the Tarot, which depicts an angel pouring water from one vessel into another:
"compensating." A comparison of its symbolism with that of hexagram number
41 yields many insights:

The Path of ... TEMPERANCE, leads from ... the Personality [ego] to the
Higher Self ... The whole experience is one of preparation of the

41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Personality [ego], and the body in which it is operating, to deal with an
influx of Light which would be devastating to a system unready to
handle such energy. Most important here is the monitoring of progress,
the continual testing from above. It is the angel here which is at once the
Higher Self and the initiatory forces of Nature, which pours the elixir
from vase to vase. This is an ongoing process of testing; measuring to see
how much the physical vehicle can bear.
R. Wang -- The Qabalistic Tarot

Without belaboring the point, we can see that all sacrifice is a kind of
remuneration: it couldn't be otherwise in an interconnected universe. The Image
instruction for the superior man to “control his anger” is also echoed in the
Temperance card. This relates to:

...an aspect of the Mysteries only rarely discussed, and certainly germane
to the Twenty-Fifth Path [the Kabbalistic equivalent of the relationship
between lines one and four in this hexagram]: this is the very real
hostility often felt by the student toward the Path itself, as he works day
after day and seems to be getting nowhere. Such hostility and
frustration is in itself a major test; it is part and parcel of the work prior
to the emergence of inner proofs. -- Ibid

"Decrease with sincerity" (Liu) refers to one's continuous sacrifice for the
goals of the Work, and "curbing anger" (Ritsema/Karcher) is how one handles
the archetypal forces evoked when the decrease seems endless and you've yet to
receive anything in return. Like any other hexagram, Compensating
Sacrifice can symbolize an infinity of possible situations, but psychologically
speaking we can first regard it as an image of sacrifice for the purpose of attaining
a balance of power within the psyche. Without the sacrificial devotion of the ego,
the Self cannot attain its will; and if the Self can't make it, the ego is doomed by
default.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject suspending his own affairs, and
hurrying away to help the subject of the fourth line. He will commit no error, but
let him consider how far he should contribute of what is his for the other.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Going quickly when one's tasks are finished is without
blame. But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.

Blofeld: To hurry away when work is done is not wrong, but first consider
whether such a hasty departure will harm the work.

Liu: To go quickly after the work is done brings no blame. One should consider
how much the decrease will be.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Ritsema/Karcher: Climaxing affairs, swiftly going. Without fault. Discussing
Diminishing it.

Shaughnessy: Already serving the ends in going; there is no trouble; toasting
decreases it.

Cleary (1): Ending affairs, going quickly, there is no fault; but assess before
reducing something.

Cleary (2): ... Assess the reduction of this.

Wu: He stops doing his own things, and swiftly goes forward. There will be no
blame. He should consider limiting the loss.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The subject of the fourth line mingles her wishes with his.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The mind of the one above accords with one's own. Blofeld:
Moreover, the approval of our superiors must first be obtained. Ritsema/
Karcher: Honoring uniting purposes indeed. Cleary (2): Valuing unification
of aims. Wu: He does what pleases the above.

Legge: Line one is dynamic and his correlate in line four is magnetic. He wants
to help her, but won't leave anything of his own undone in doing so. Nor will he
diminish anything of his own for her without due deliberation.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man disregards his own interests to help his superior. The
latter should be sensitive to the amount of such help that can be accepted without
harm to the subordinate. Neither should a subordinate give without due
consideration.

Wing: When you are in a position to help others or to be helped yourself, be
certain that moderation is exercised. To give or take too much can result in an
imbalanced situation. Think this through carefully before acting.

Editor: The full meaning of this line is best evoked by comparing it with its
fourth line correlate. This is an image of less than total support. It says: "Render
all due assistance." It is left up to you to differentiate the appropriate amount,
which is a hint that a test may be involved. ("...Let him consider how far he
should contribute of what is his for the other" can sometimes imply a warning
about slavish service to archetypal powers.) When compared with the image of
line four, we get a definite picture of an active balancing of forces – perhaps a
dialectical process. The Self is demanding a differentiation from the rational ego.
This is a complex line which often implies messages which are literally impossible
to put into words.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Principally he must know how far he is willing to go, what he is willing to
sacrifice. There is nothing more easy to say than everything. A man can
never sacrifice everything and this can never be required of him. But he
must define exactly what he is willing to sacrifice and not bargain about
it afterwards.
Gurdjieff

A. An image of judicious choices to attain proper balance or equitable
compensation of forces.

B. How much are you willing to give to the Work? (Be careful with your
answer!)

C. Render aid to "the one above." (The Self.)
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows that it will be advantageous for its
subject to maintain firm correctness, and that action on his part will be evil. He
can give increase to his correlate without taking from himself.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance furthers. To undertake something brings
misfortune. Without decreasing oneself, one is able to bring increase to others.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings reward, but to advance (or go
anywhere) now would bring misfortune. This is not a time for decreasing but for
augmenting.

Liu: To continue is beneficial. Undertakings bring misfortune. Without
decrease, without increase.

Ritsema/Karcher: Harvesting Trial. Chastising: pitfall. Nowhere
Diminishing, augmenting it.

Shaughnessy: Beneficial to determine; to be upright is inauspicious. Not
decreasing it, but increasing it.

Cleary (1): It is beneficial to be correct. An expedition is inauspicious. No
reduction or increase of this. [If you do not know when enough is enough and go
on reducing and increasing, you will reactivate the human mentality and thus
obscure the mind of Tao ... It is because the strong energy is balanced, not
biased or lopsided, that there is no more reduction or increasing to be done.]

Cleary (2): ... Increase it without reduction.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Wu: It is advantageous to be firm and correct, but foreboding to go ahead. His
decision of not taking a loss will benefit the other. [It may be justifiable for the
below to support the above in a very moderate way in time of Loss, but it would
be unacceptable by asking the below to give up all of its possessions ... to satisfy
the above.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His central position gives its character to his aim.
Wilhelm/Baynes: It has the correct mean in its mind. Blofeld: The central
position of this line in the lower trigram indicates that persistence will be
rewarded by the fulfillment of what is willed. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering
using activating purposes indeed. Cleary (2): The balance that characterizes its
aim. Wu: He is to remain central.

Legge: Line two is dynamic and in the central place. But he is in the place of a
magnetic line, and should maintain his position without moving to help his fifth
line correlate. Maintaining his own firm correctness is the best way to give
assistance. "His aim" is to abide where he is and help the fifth line by the
exhibition of firm correctness.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man renders faithful service without sacrificing himself. Forfeiting
one's dignity and personality to do the bidding of a person of high rank is
shameful.

Wing: When aiding others, be certain to maintain your sense of dignity. If
the nature of your task diminishes your strength or compromises your principles,
or if you sacrifice your personality to please your superior, you are acting
shamefully. Only efforts that do not diminish your Self are worthwhile.

Editor: This line changes the hexagram to number twenty- seven, Nourishing,
the corresponding line of which carries a similar message, i.e., the idea that one's
impetus to act is incorrect. Lines one and three each show some variation of
active compensating (balancing) going on. Here in line two, which is the center
of the lower trigram, action is inappropriate. It is the fulcrum or point of balance
which must remain stationary. Note the subtle differences in the various
translations of the last sentence. You decide.

The Sage uses his mind like a mirror. It remains in its place passively,
and it gives back what it receives without concealment. Therefore it can
overcome things without distorting them.
Chuangtse

A. You serve the Work best now by remaining in place. Willpower, non-
action and example are all the assistance that is required.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

B. Maintain the status-quo.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows how of three men walking together, the
number is diminished by one; and how one, walking, finds his friend.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When three people journey together, their number decreases
by one. When one man journeys alone, he finds a companion.

Blofeld: If three set forth together now, one will be lost on the way; whereas one
man going forth alone will find company.

Liu: Three people walking together will lose one. When one walks alone, he will
meet a friend.

Ritsema/Karcher: Three people moving, by-consequence Diminishing the-
one-person. The-one-person moving. By-consequence acquiring one's
friend.

Shaughnessy: If three men move then they will decrease by one man; if one
man moves then he will obtain his friend.

Cleary (1): Three people traveling are reduced by one person; one person
traveling finds a companion.

Cleary (2): ... One person traveling gets companionship.

Wu: When three persons walk, one will be left out. When one walks alone, he
will find a friend.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: When three are together, doubts arise among them.
Wilhelm/Baynes: If a person should seek to journey as one of three, mistrust
would arise. Blofeld: It is well to travel alone now, as three would give rise to
suspicion. Ritsema/Karcher: Three by-consequence doubting indeed. Cleary
(2): When one person travels, three then doubt. Wu: Three would create
doubts.

The Master said: "Heaven and earth come together, and all things take
shape and find form. Male and female mix their seed, and all creatures take
shape and are born. In the Book of Changes it is said: `When three people
journey together, their number decreases by one. When one man journeys
alone, he finds a companion.' This refers to the effect of becoming one."
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Legge: Chu Hsi says that the lower trigram was originally three yang lines, like
"three men" walking together, and that the third line was removed and made into
the topmost line of the upper trigram which was originally three yin lines. This
exchange of places between lines three and six maintains their proper correlation
and suggests the proper pairing of affinities. The K'ang-hsi editors observe that
this line is true not only of three men, but of many repetitions of thought or
action.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A close bond is possible only between two persons. A group of three
engenders jealousy. The lone man finds a complementary companion.

Wing: The closest bonds are now possible only between two persons. Groups of
three create jealousy and mistrust and will eventually splinter. Yet someone who
remains alone becomes lonely and will seek a companion. It is time to strike a
proper balance.

Editor: The original condition described by Chu Hsi is an image of hexagram
number eleven, Harmony, which represents the correct union of male and
female forces. Psychologically the Syzygy archetype is suggested: the proper
pairing of male and female which is seen in its supreme state in the hieros gamos
or holy marriage. (See commentary on hexagram eleven for further detail.) A
dialectical process is also implied.

God unfolds himself in the world in the form of syzygies (paired
opposites), such as heaven/earth, day/night, male/female, etc ... At the
end of this fragmentation process there follows the return to the
beginning, the consummation of the universe through purification and
annihilation.
Jung -- Aion

A. The image suggests a sorting-out of affinities to attain balance or unity.
Forces are seeking their natural level.

B. "Birds of a feather flock together."
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject diminishing the ailment
under which she labors by making the subject of the first line hasten to her help,
and make her glad. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If a man decreases his faults, it makes the other hasten to
come and rejoice. No blame.
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Blofeld: He reduced the number of ills besetting him and thus hastened the
arrival of happiness -- no error!

Liu: If he decreases his sickness (or faults) quickly, he will be happy. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Diminishing one's affliction. Commissioning swiftly
possesses rejoicing. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Decreasing his illness; serving ends has happiness; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Reducing sickness, causing there to be joy quickly, there is no fault.

Cleary (2): Reducing the ailment causes there to be joy soon. No blame.

Wu: His illness is alleviated and conditions are quickly improved. There is joy.
No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is a matter for joy. Wilhelm/Baynes: It is indeed
something that gives cause for joy. Blofeld: A reduction of troubles is in itself a
cause for happiness. Ritsema/Karcher: Truly permitting rejoicing indeed.
Cleary (2): Reducing the ailment is a matter of joy. Wu: Capable of alleviating
his illness is a cause for joy.

Legge: Line four is magnetic in a magnetic place, like someone ailing and unable
to perform her proper work. But her first line correlate is strong, and is made to
hasten to four's relief. The joy of the line shows her desire to do her part in the
work of the hexagram.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: As a consequence of giving up his bad habits, the man attracts the help of
well-disposed friends.

Wing: If you can now locate your shortcomings and bad habits and make a
serious attempt to decrease them you will be approached by friends and helpers.
A humble attitude on your part will open the way to progressive interaction and
joy.

Editor: The full meaning of this line is best evoked by comparing it with its first
line correlate. All translations render line four in the imagery of decreasing one's
faults (or illness). That is: rid yourself of error and happiness will come to you.
Legge's version depicts incapacity which is overcome through a correct union
with line one. Taken in this sense, the line can symbolize the Self (line four,
upper trigram of Heaven) gaining from the ego's sacrifice in spacetime (line one,
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

lower trigram of Earth). Whatever the context of your query, the image here is of
a harmonization of forces to bring about balance.

Man is a materialized thought; he is what he thinks. To change his
nature from the mortal to the immortal state he must cease to hold fast in
his thoughts to that which is illusory and perishing, and hold on to that
which is eternal.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

A. A decrease in error is an increase in truth.

B. The elimination of imbalance promotes union; the elimination of
illusion makes room for joy.

C. The one above (the Self) accepts your aid, endorses your action, etc.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows parties adding to the stores of its subject
ten pairs of tortoise shells, and accepting no refusal. There will be great good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Someone does indeed increase him. Ten pairs of tortoises
cannot oppose it. Supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: There was one who enriched him to the extent of ten PENG of tortoise
shells (2,100 of them) and who would accept no refusal -- sublime good fortune!

Liu: He is enriched by twenty tortoises and he cannot refuse. Great good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Maybe augmenting's ten: partnering's tortoise. Nowhere
a controlling contradiction. Spring significant.

Shaughnessy: Increasing it by ten double-strands of turtles; you cannot deflect
it; prime auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): One is given a profit of ten pairs of tortoise shells. None can oppose.
Very auspicious.

Wu: He may be presented with ten pairs of tortoise shells and may not decline
the gift. This is great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to the blessing from above. Wilhelm/Baynes:
The supreme good fortune comes from its being blessed from above. Blofeld:
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

Good fortune coming from those above. Ritsema/Karcher: Originating-from
shielding above indeed. Cleary (2): Help from above. Wu: He has been blessed
from heaven.

Legge: Line five is the seat of the ruler, who is here humble, and welcomes the
assistance of her correlate in line two. She is a ruler whom all her subjects of
ability will rejoice to serve in every possible way, and the result will be great good
fortune.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Fate has marked the man for good fortune. Nothing opposes him. He needs
fear nothing.

Wing: You are marked by fate. Nothing stands in the way of this. It comes about
through refined inner forces that have led you into this situation. Fear nothing.
Good fortune.

Editor: The most ancient method of divination in China involved the use of
tortoise shells (Plastromancy). The yarrow stalk and coin methods didn't come
into vogue until after King Wen committed the I Ching to writing. At the time
that this line was composed then, to receive ten pairs of tortoise shells was a very
numinous gift -- perhaps equivalent to "having God on your side.” The "blessing
from above” is mentioned by some commentators as a reference to the oracles
obtained through divining with the tortoise shells, and could be construed as an
endorsement of your interpretative skills. This line changes the hexagram to
number sixty-one, Inner Truth, the corresponding line of which expresses the
idea of a beneficial synthesis of forces.

Good fortune is a god among men, and more than a god.
Aeschylus

A. A great reward -- the context of your query will tell you what it is.

B. Beneficial energy is on its way.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject giving increase to others
without taking from himself. There will be no error. With firm correctness there
will be good fortune. There will be advantage in every movement that shall be
made. He will find ministers more than can be counted by their clans.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one is increased without depriving others, there is no
blame. Perseverance brings good fortune. It furthers one to undertake
something. One obtains servants but no longer has a separate home. [Through
perseverance and zealous work a man wins success and finds helpers as they
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

are needed. But what he accomplishes is not a limited private advantage; it is a
public good and available to everyone... There are loyal helpers, but not for
promoting family interests.]

Blofeld: Gain which causes no loss to others involves no error. Persistence in a
righteous course brings good fortune. It is favorable to have in view some goal (or
destination). He obtains followers but not a family (or home).

Liu: If one increases (gains) without anyone decreasing (losing), no blame. To
continue brings good fortune. It is beneficial to go somewhere else; one will find a
helper after leaving home.

Ritsema/Karcher: Nowhere Diminishing, augmenting it. Without fault. Trial:
significant. Harvesting: possessing directed going. Acquiring a servant, without
dwelling.

Shaughnessy: Not decreasing it, but increasing it; there is no trouble;
determination is auspicious; there is someplace to go; obtain a servant without
family.

Cleary (1): Not reducing or increasing this is faultless. Correctness brings good
fortune. It is beneficial to go somewhere. Getting a servant, there is no house.
[The mind of Tao is the master, the human mind is the servant. When the mind
of Tao is in charge of things, every step, every undertaking, is celestial design;
personal desires do not arise, and even the human mind transforms into the
mind of Tao: “getting a servant, there is no house” ... This is returning to
ultimate good by reduction.]

Cleary (2): Increase without reduction, and there will be no blame. Correctness
leads to good results. There is somewhere to go. Getting an administrator without
a house. [To increase the third yin, it is necessary not to reduce the top yang.
This is because the third yin as an administrator is in the position of “losing
one’s home in the service of the country,” but the top yang perceives the sincerity
of this lone journey, so this is “great attainment of the objective,” and the third
yin considers this “getting companionship.” This is called “increase without
reduction.”]

Wu: His wishes of not taking a loss will benefit others. No error. Perseverance
brings auspiciousness. It is advantageous to have undertakings. His subordinates
are so dedicated to their assignments that they act as if they had no families.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He obtains his wish on a grand scale. Wilhelm/Baynes:
He attains his will in great measure. Blofeld: The first sentence presages the
complete fulfillment of what is willed. Ritsema/Karcher: The great acquiring
41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

purpose indeed. Cleary (2): Increase without reduction is great attainment of
the objective. Wu: His aspiration is fully realized.

Legge: Line six has been changed from a magnetic to a dynamic line from line
three. He has received the greatest increase and will carry out the idea of the
hexagram in the highest degree and style. He can increase others without
diminishing his own resources, and the benefit will be incalculable. Ministers will
come to serve him, and not one from each clan only, but many. Ch'eng-tzu says
on line six: "Dwelling on high and taking nothing from those below him, but on
the contrary giving more to them, the superior man accomplishes his aim on a
grand scale. The aim of the superior man is simply to be increasing what others
have -- that and nothing else.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man increases in power and dispenses blessings to the world without
diminishing his own resources. Everyone willingly serves him because he does
not siphon off resources to his private advantage.

Wing: Expand your goals to encompass a more universal pursuit. In this way
others will lend support. Your successes will lead you to a new public awareness.
You may find this social position and responsibility a desirable new life-style and
a benefit to many.

Editor: There is a conceptual disagreement between Legge's rendition of this
line and that of the other translators. Legge: “increasing others while not
decreasing oneself.” Wilhelm: “increasing oneself without decreasing others.”
Cleary’s Buddhist version is the most neutral: “increase without reduction.” My
understanding of the hexagram is that it depicts a process of active compensation
-- the continuous give and take of life which maintains a fair equilibrium: neither
pole imbalances the other. Psychologically interpreted, the sentence about the
“servant but no home,” suggests the creation of a kind of Psychic Commonwealth
in which all the complexes have become integrated enough to abandon their
partisan interests and serve the intentions of the Self. The ego as an
administrator or servant is essential for the attainment of this.

Insofar as analytical treatment makes the “shadow” conscious, it causes
a cleavage and a tension of opposites which in their turn seek
compensation in unity.
Jung – Memories, Dreams, Reflections

It may be thought that a few initiates living life according to principle
could have little effect on the vast mass of people living their lives in
various degrees of chaos, seeking only after pleasure and profit rather
than principle. The point is, though, that a life lived with talismanic

41 -- Compensating Sacrifice -- 41

intention has far greater force than one that has its patterns based, not
on spiritual reality, but on day to day physical expediency.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. A harmonious alliance or balance of power is created through the wise
apportionment of energy and resources.

B. It costs you nothing to benefit the situation.

C. Increase without decrease.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-TWO --
INCREASE

Other titles: The Symbol of Addition, Gain, Augmenting, Help from Above,
Benefit, Advantage, Profit, Expansion

Judgment

Legge: Increase denotes advantage in every movement which shall be
undertaken -- it will be advantageous even to cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It
furthers one to cross the great water.

Blofeld: Gain. It is favorable to have in view some goal (or destination) and to
cross the great water (or sea).

Liu: Increase. It is of benefit to set forth. It is of benefit to cross the great
water.

Ritsema/Karcher: Augmenting, Harvesting: possessing directed going.
Harvesting: wading the Great River. [This hexagram describes your situation in
terms of increase and advance. It emphasizes that expanding the quantity and
quality of your involvement is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord
with the time, you are told to augment!]

Shaughnessy: Increase: Beneficial herewith to have someplace to go;
beneficial to find the great river.

Cleary (1): For Increase, it is beneficial to go somewhere; it is beneficial to
cross great rivers.

Wu: Gain indicates an advantage in having undertakings and in crossing a big
river.

The Image

Legge: Wind over thunder -- the image of Increase. When the superior man
perceives good, he moves toward it; when he perceives his faults, he eliminates
them.
42 -- Increase -- 42

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wind and thunder: the image of Increase. Thus the
superior man: if he sees good, he imitates it; if he has faults, he rids himself of
them.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind and thunder. The Superior Man,
seeing what is good, imitates it; seeing what is bad, he corrects it.

Liu: Wind and thunder symbolize Increase. When the superior man discovers
good, he follows it. When he has errors, he corrects them.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wind, thunder. Augmenting. A chun tzu uses visualizing
improvement, by-consequence shifting. A chun tzu uses possessing excess, by-
consequence amending.

Cleary (1): Wind and thunder increase. Thus do superior people take to good
when they see it, and correct whatever faults they have.

Wu: Wind and thunder make Gain. Thus, when the jun zi sees a good deed, he
improves his own at once; when he realizes he is making a mistake, he corrects it
at once.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Increase shows the upper trigram brilliantly decreased to
augment the lower. What descends from above reaches to all below, and the
satisfaction of the people is without limit. Advantage in movement is shown in
the blessings dispensed by the second and fifth lines from their correct positions.
The action of Wood shows that it is advantageous to cross the great stream.
Through the trigrams of Movement and Humility there is unlimited daily
advancement -- heaven dispenses and earth produces, and all proceeds according
to the requirements of the time.

Legge: Increase has the opposite meaning to hexagram number forty-one,
Compensating Sacrifice [Decrease]. What king Wen had in mind was a
ruler or a government operating to dispense benefits to the people and increase
their resources. The two important lines in the figure are the correlates two and
five. The general auspice of the hexagram is one of being successful in one's
enterprises and of overcoming the greatest difficulties.

The formation of the trigrams here is the reverse of that in the preceding
hexagram. The people are full of pleasure in the labors of the ruler for their good.
"The action of Wood" in the Confucian commentary refers to the upper trigram,
which is the symbol of Wind and Wood. From wood boats are made on which the
great stream may be crossed. In three hexagrams, this, fifty-nine and sixty-one, in
which this is the upper trigram, we find mention made of crossing the great
stream. In the Image thunder and wind are seen to increase one another, and
their combination gives the idea of Increase.
42 -- Increase -- 42
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Take advantage of your opportunities.

The Superior Man recognizes his duty and rectifies his mistakes. Or:
"Accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative."

If the ego's sacrifices for the good of the Work are described in the
previous hexagram, here we see the inverse image of that figure in which it is the
Self who bestows its blessings upon the psyche. The one implies the other -- in
the words of an old Blues lyric: "If you don't put somethin' in, you can't get
nothin' out..." The forty-first and forty-second hexagrams are intimately related,
and in their interaction portray the active progress of the Work. To paraphrase
the last sentence of the Confucian commentary: "The Self dispenses and the ego
produces, and all proceeds according to the requirements of the time."

If a man continually weighs his actions and aims at the mean, he is in the
highest of human ranks. In that way, he will come close to God and will
attain what belongs to Him. This is the most perfect of the ways of
worship.
Maimonides -- Eight Chapters

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows that it will be advantageous for its subject
in his position to make a great movement. If it be greatly fortunate, no blame will
be imputed to him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: It furthers one to accomplish great deeds. Supreme good
fortune. No blame.

Blofeld: The time is favorable for undertaking great works -- sublime good
fortune and no error!

Liu: It is beneficial to undertake a great enterprise. Sublime good fortune. No
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Harvesting: availing-of activating the great, arousing.
Spring significant, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Beneficial herewith to do the great creation; prime
auspiciousness; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): It is beneficial to act so as to do great work: this is very auspicious
and blameless.
42 -- Increase -- 42

Cleary (2): It is beneficial to undertake to do great work. If it turns out very
well, there is no blame.

Wu: It is beneficial to do farming. There is great fortune, no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Though it is not for one in so low a position to have to do
with great affairs. Wilhelm/Baynes: Those below do not use it for their own
convenience. Blofeld: What is said about sublime good fortune and freedom
from error means that those below do not complain of having too much to do.
[This suggests that others will now work for us gladly.] Ritsema/Karcher:
The below, not munificent affairs indeed. Cleary (2): It is not for those in low
positions to be deeply concerned with affairs. Wu: A person in this position is
not suitable to do a delicate task.

Legge: Line one is dynamic, but his low position might seem to prevent him
from any great enterprise. Favored as he is, however, by the general idea of the
hexagram, and responding to his proper correlate in the fourth line, it is natural
that he should make a movement. Great success will make his rashness
irrelevant. The Confucian commentary says that "one in a low position should
not move in great affairs" -- not a son, it is said, while his father is alive, nor a
minister while his ruler governs, nor a member of an official department while its
head directs its affairs. If such a one does initiate such an affair, only great
success will excuse his rashness.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man receives help from on high. He should use it to
accomplish something correspondingly worthwhile. Success will cause his
rashness to be forgotten.

Wing: You are blessed with the energy to approach a large task, which at any
other time you may have avoided or not even considered. Success is yours if your
goal is worthwhile and can Benefit others. Consider this carefully. In this way
your reputation will remain above reproach.

Editor: Despite the confusing Confucian commentary, this is one of the very few
lines in the entire Book of Changes that counsels unconstrained movement.
Psychologically interpreted, action taken in the matter at hand will be in
accordance with the will of the Self.

One must seek out what one's True Will is, and do it -- irrespective of
whether it is convenient or not. Once one’s true will is found, to

42 -- Increase -- 42

implement it will require change, and change is always painful -- or
always appears so.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. Decisive action may be taken now.

B. Archetypal forces ("those below") cooperate with the ego to effect
positive action.

C. "Go for it!"
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows parties adding to the stores of its
subject ten pairs of tortoise shells whose oracles cannot be opposed. Let her
persevere in being firm and correct, and there will be good fortune. Let the ruler,
having the virtues thus distinguished, employ them in presenting her offerings to
God, and there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Someone does indeed increase him; Ten pairs of tortoises
cannot oppose it. Constant perseverance brings good fortune. The king presents
him before God. Good fortune.

Blofeld: There was one who enriched him to the extent of ten PENG or tortoise
shells (2,100 of them) and who would accept no refusal -- unwavering persistence
in a righteous course brings good fortune! The King sacrificed to the Supreme
Lord of Heaven [From the point of view of divination, this can be taken to mean
that we are about to benefit either from our earlier devotions or from some
sacrifice either to moral principles or to the public good.] -- good fortune!

Liu: Someone enriches him with twenty tortoises. He cannot refuse. Perpetual
continuance brings good fortune. The king makes a presentation to God. Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Maybe Augmenting's ten: partnering's tortoise. Nowhere a
controlling contradiction. Perpetual Trial significant. Kinghood availing-of
presenting tending- towards the supreme, significant.

Shaughnessy: Someone increases it by ten double-strands of turtles; you
cannot deflect it; permanent determination is auspicious. The king uses aromatic
grass to Di; auspicious.

Cleary (1): One gains ten sets of tortoise shells, and none can oppose. Perpetual
correctness is auspicious. It is good for the king to serve the lord.
42 -- Increase -- 42

Cleary (2): ... It bodes well to be always correct. It bodes well for the king to
make offerings to God.

Wu: He may be presented with ten pairs of tortoise shells and may not decline
the gift. Being constantly persevering is auspicious. The king makes offerings to
the Supreme Being in heaven. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: ("Parties add to her stores") -- they come from beyond her
immediate circle to do so. Wilhelm/Baynes: This comes from without.
Blofeld: The one who enriched him came from elsewhere. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Originating-from outside, coming indeed. Cleary (2): What one is given comes
from outside. Wu: Because it comes from without.

Legge: Compare this line with line five of hexagram number forty-one,
Compensating Sacrifice. Line two is magnetic, but in the center, and is the
correlate of line five. Friends give her the valuable gifts mentioned. "That is,"
says Kuo Yung (Sung Dynasty) "men benefit her. The oracles of the divination
(i.e., the favorable spirits) benefit her also. And finally, when the ruler sacrifices
to God, God accepts. Heaven confers benefit from above." Line five, as the
proper correlate here, is among the contributing parties, but others beyond will
be won to take part with him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The ensuing gains issue naturally from the inner goodness of the man, who
is in harmony with the highest laws of the universe.

Wing: Because you are receptive to worthwhile aims and energies, you are
successful in your endeavors. You may think of it as exceptionally good luck. You
can maintain the momentum of this fortunate time if you preserve the normal
structure of your life. Do not become rash or overly confident.

Editor: If we reverse this hexagram it becomes number forty- one,
Compensating Sacrifice, and this line (now "upside down") becomes line five
of that figure, with a meaning nearly identical to this one. (See the commentary
on 41:5 for the significance of the tortoise shells.) It is also interesting to note
that in each case the changing line (either 42:2 or 41:5) changes its respective
hexagram to number sixty-one, Inner Truth. Kuo Yung's mention of
"favorable spirits" bringing increases to the recipient of this line is reminiscent of
the legions of angels said to appear at the birth or inception of a new and positive
force into spacetime:
42 -- Increase -- 42

And suddenly with the angel there was a great throng of the heavenly
host, praising God and singing: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and
peace to men who enjoy his favor."
Luke 2: 13-14

A. Extraordinary benefits accrue from outside your immediate awareness.
The Work bears fruit if you maintain your will and devotion.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows increase given to its subject by means of
what is evil, so that she shall be led to good, and be without blame. Let her be
sincere and pursue the path of the Mean, so shall she secure the recognition of
the ruler, like an officer who announces herself to her prince by the symbol of her
rank.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One is enriched through unfortunate events. No blame, if
you are sincere and walk in the middle, and report with a seal to the prince.

Blofeld: He used an unfortunate means to gain something; but, as he acted in
all sincerity, he was not to blame. Walking in the center (of the hall) to report to
the Prince, he carried his jade tablet of office. [The additional Chinese
commentaries declared that the jade tablet is a symbol of our being able to give
an assurance of our faithfulness.]

Liu: He is enriched by unfortunate affairs. No blame, if you are sincere and
moderate in your conduct, and report to the officials for the record.

Ritsema/Karcher: Augmenting's availing-of pitfall affairs. Without fault.
Possessing conformity, center moving. Notifying the prince, availing-of the
scepter.

Shaughnessy: Increase it, using work service; there is no trouble. There is a
return in the middle of the ranks reporting to the duke using a tessera.

Cleary (1): Using unfortunate events to gain increase is blameless. Acting in a
moderate, balanced way with sincerity and truthfulness, public announcement
uses the imperial seal.

Cleary (2): Enhancement through unfortunate events is blameless. Sincere and
balanced in action, one presents impartial use of authority.

Wu: He experiences increasing misfortune, but this is blameless. He proceeds
with confidence and reports to his prince by holding a tablet in his hands.
42 -- Increase -- 42
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Increase is given by means of what is evil and difficult, as
she has in herself the qualities called forth. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is
something that certainly is one's due. Blofeld: His gaining something by an
unfortunate means may lead to the supposition that such means are a matter of
course. Ritsema/Karcher: Firmly possessing it indeed. Cleary (2): There
has always been such a thing as enhancement through unfortunate events. [If one
can believe that misfortune is beneficial, then it is no longer unfortunate.] Wu:
“He experiences increasing misfortune,” because of his position, not his doing.

Legge: Line three is magnetic, neither central nor in her correct position. It
would seem therefore that she should have no increase given to her. But it is the
time for giving increase, and the idea of her receiving it by means of evil things is
put into the line. That such things serve for reproof and correction is well known
to Chinese moralists. But the paragraph goes on also to caution and admonish.
There is a soul of good even in those who seem only evil, and adversity may
quicken it.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Even unfortunate events accrue to the good of the man. Pursued with
reasonableness and sincerity, they exert beneficial influence, as if officially
sanctioned.

Wing: You may find that you are going to Benefit from what might be
considered unfortunate circumstances. If you hold to your principles,
nevertheless, you can avoid reproach.

Editor: Every translation of the Confucian commentary says something
distinctly different in the English language. When this happens it is a fair
assumption that the original is ambiguous as well. My experience with the line
prefers Wilhelm’s version of line and commentary. Psychologically interpreted,
since the idea of "No blame" applies, we can assume that a painful but necessary
transformation is in progress. This may be taking place on unconscious levels of
the psyche.

Life on earth is tough. Of that there is no doubt, but esoteric tradition
says, that under these harsh conditions of maximum physical constraint,
many things can be quickly acquired, that are not possible in the upper
worlds. The pleasure and pain of the body are the vital teaching
situation of the psyche. Illness, love, even war, may be important
demonstrations to the non- sensual psyche, of laws it has to respect, both
below and above.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree

A. "Through adversity we acquire strength."
42 -- Increase -- 42

B. Growing pains.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject pursuing the due course.
Her advice to her prince is followed. She can with advantage be relied on in such
a movement as that of removing the capital.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If you walk in the middle and report to the prince, he will
follow. It furthers one to be used in the removal of the capital.

Blofeld: He walked up the center of the hall and informed the Prince of his
fealty. It is favorable to be entrusted with the task of removing the capital.

Liu: If you are moderate in your conduct, people will follow you. It is beneficial
to be dependent or move to a new place.

Ritsema/Karcher: Center moving. Notifying the prince, adhering. Harvesting:
availing-of activating depending-on shifting the city.

Shaughnessy: In the middle of the ranks reporting to the duke to follow;
beneficial herewith to make a family and to transfer the state.

Cleary (1): When balanced action is openly expressed, the public follows. It is
beneficial to use a support to move the nation.

Cleary (2): Balanced action openly expressed is followed impartially. It is
beneficial to use this as a basis to move the center of operations.

Wu: When his approach is central, the prince will value his counsel. It will be
beneficial to counsel the prince on relocating the capital.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her only object is the increase of the general good.
Wilhelm/Baynes: "If you report to the prince, he will follow," because his
purposes are thereby increased. Blofeld: He reported his fealty so as to be of use
in carrying out the Prince's will. Ritsema/Karcher: Using Augmenting
purpose indeed. Cleary (2): Open expression of impartial following is because of
the beneficial aim. Wu: his goal is to benefit the state.

Legge: Line four is the place of the minister -- next to the ruler. She is magnetic,
but her position is appropriate, and since she follows the due course, her ruler
listens to her and even supports the most critical movements. Changing the
42 -- Increase -- 42

capital from place to place was frequent in feudal China. That of Shang, which
preceded Chou, was changed five times.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: As the mediator between the prince and his followers, the man renders
proper advice on the distribution of benefits. If he does not retain portions for
selfish purposes and follows a moderate course, he will retain the confidence of
all for executing critical projects.

Wing: You have the opportunity to act as a mediator between someone in a
higher position than yourself and those below you, whom you represent. If you
express yourself in a reasonable manner and make Benefit to all concerned the
first priority of your interests, your advice will be followed. This influential
position can have far-reaching effects.

Editor: This is an image of trustworthiness. All the translators except Legge
emphasize the idea of moderation, or "walking in the middle." Wilhelm and Liu
also make it a conditional statement: “If” you follow the middle way, etc.

The ego has both to exert and to restrain its power drive, not only in
respect to inner and outer entities but in respect also to its own position
and needs as conscious center. This means that the function of the ego is
not only one of controlling but of balancing and directing...It has the task
of emotional integration of experience, that is, of adaptation to the inner
world by realizing itself in relation to the Self, to the total functioning
authority.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Balanced devotion to the Work will ensure the reciprocity of inner
forces. A new seat of power may thus be created within the psyche.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject with sincere heart seeking to
benefit all below. There need be no question about it; the result will be great
good fortune. All below will with sincere heart acknowledge his goodness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not. Supreme good
fortune. Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.

Blofeld: Be confident (or sincere) and kind, but refrain from asking questions
and you will enjoy sublime good fortune. Faithfulness (or sincerity) and
confidence are virtues proper to us.
42 -- Increase -- 42

Liu: If you are sincere and benevolent in your heart, without consulting, there
will be great good fortune. People will trust your benevolent character.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, a benevolent heart. No question,
Spring significant. Possessing conformity, benevolence: my actualizing tao.
[Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of
the cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being
become what it is meant to be.]

Shaughnessy: There is a return with a kind heart; do not question it; prime
auspiciousness. There is a return that treats kindly my virtue.

Cleary (1): When there is truthfulness and a benevolent heart, there is no need
to ask – it is very auspicious. Truthfulness and benevolence are charismatic
qualities in oneself.

Cleary (2): There is sincerity to benefit the mind. Do not ask – it is very
auspicious. There is sincerity granting one’s rewards.

Wu: Having confidence in his people and being benevolent-hearted, he enjoys
great auspiciousness without asking for it. His people return his kindly virtue by
placing their confidence in him.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He gets what he desires on a great scale. Wilhelm/
Baynes: You have attained your purpose completely. Blofeld: The whole of
this passage presages the fulfillment of what is willed. Ritsema/Karcher:
Actually no questioning it. The great acquiring purpose indeed. Cleary (2): Do
not question it. Great achievement of what is intended. Wu: He asks no
questions. His goal is amply realized.

Legge: Line five is dynamic, in its fitting position, and central. It is the seat of
the ruler, who has his proper correlate in line two. Everything good, according to
the conditions of the hexagram, may be said of him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Without asking for recognition and gratitude, the man in a high position
benefits those below. He acts from the inner necessity of acknowledged goodness.

Wing: A true kindness on your part, something you did or will do without
thought of your own gain, will bring you recognition.

Editor: The image suggests a cornucopia of power flowing to meet that which is
receptive to it. If this is the only changing line the new hexagram becomes
number twenty-seven, Nourishment. Literally: “Increase brings about

Nourishment.” Sincere: Heartfelt, true. Heart: Center, core, source. All below:
Unconscious complexes, components of the psyche, etc.

Jung uses the term Self to represent the center of psychic awareness that
transcends ego consciousness and includes in its scope all the vast
reaches of the psyche that are ordinarily unconscious; it therefore is not
merely a personal consciousness but a nonpersonal one as well.
Achievement of this level has been regarded by most of the great religions
of the world as the supreme goal. It is expressed in such terms as
“finding the God within." For the Self, the center of this new kind of
consciousness is felt to be distinct from the ego and to possess an absolute
authority within the psyche. It speaks with a voice of command exerting
a power over the individual as great as that of the instincts.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. The image suggests the Self bringing increase to its satellites.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows us one to whose increase none will
contribute, while many will seek to assail him. He observes no regular rule in the
ordering of his heart. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He brings increase to no one. Indeed, someone even strikes
him. He does not keep his heart constantly steady. Misfortune.

Blofeld: He did not attempt to benefit them and someone struck him for his
inconstancy of heart -- misfortune!

Liu: He benefits no one. Someone will attack him. His mind is not consistent.
Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Absolutely-no Augmenting it. Maybe smiting it.
Establishing the heart, no persevering. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: No one increases it, someone hits it; establishing the heart but
not making it constant; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Don’t increase here, or you may be attacked. If determination is
inconsistent, that brings misfortune.

Cleary (2): None benefit one here; they may attack one. Do not persist in
this attitude, for that would lead to misfortune.

Wu: People do not add to his coffer. They may even assail him. He sets no
consistent course of action. Foreboding.
42 -- Increase -- 42
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: To his increase none will contribute -- this expresses but
half the result. They will come from beyond his immediate circle to assail him.
Wilhelm/Baynes: This is a saying that pictures one-sidedness. This comes
from without. Blofeld: He not benefiting them indicates prejudice: his being
struck presages that we incur the wrath of people outside our own circle.
Ritsema/Karcher: One-sided evidence indeed. Originating-from outside,
coming indeed. Cleary (2): “None benefit one here” expresses partiality; “They
may attack one” refers to what comes from without. Wu: “People do not add to
his coffer.” This is a one-sided statement. “They may even assail him,” because
he alienates them.

The Master said: "The superior man in a high place composes himself
before he tries to move others; makes his mind restful and easy before he
speaks; settles the principles of his intercourse with others before he seeks
anything from them. The superior man cultivates these three things, and so is
complete. If he tries to move others while he is himself in a state of
apprehension, the people will not respond to him; if without certain principles
of intercommunication, he issues his requests, the people will not grant them.
When there are none to accord with him, those who work to injure him will
make their appearance. As is said in the I Ching, `We see one to whose
advantage none will contribute, while some will seek to assail him. He observes
no regular rule in the ordering of his heart: there will be evil.'"

Legge: Line six is dynamic, but it should be magnetic. At the top of the figure he
will only concentrate his powers for his own advantage, and not think of
benefiting those below him. The repulsive power of selfishness is exhibited, and
the consequences will be as described. Contrast this with line two where the
attractive power of benevolence is shown: in both cases forces come from
"beyond" to do either benefit or harm.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man in a high position fails to bring benefits to those below. They,
in turn, assail his reputation and do not support him. He does not think before
speaking and does not decide the principles that govern his relationships before
he sets forth.

Wing: While you seem to have the means to Benefit others, you actually do
not. This is not in accord with the demands of the time. You will lose your
position of influence and become open to attack. This is unfortunate indeed.

Editor: Wilhelm renders Legge's "half the result" in the first sentence of the
Confucian commentary as "one-sidedness" -- an image more expressive of the
idea of selfishness. To "observe no regular rule in the ordering of the heart”
42 -- Increase -- 42

suggests inconstancy and vacillation. Perhaps selfish motives have overwhelmed
the ego's devotion to the Work. Selfishness is an imbalanced state where energy is
appropriated by a part at the expense of the whole. Negative results are
inevitable because the forces involved must seek equilibrium, and the stress of
the imbalance is released in a violent reaction.

Emotion is not an activity of the ego but, when uncontrolled, is something
that happens to it. Affects occur usually where adaptation is weakest,
and at the same time they reveal the reason for its weakness, namely a
certain degree of inferiority and the existence of a lower level of
personality. On this lower level with its uncontrolled or scarcely
controlled emotions one behaves more or less like a primitive, who is not
only the passive victim of his affects but also singularly incapable of
moral judgment.
Jung -- Aion

A. Vacillation of will invites rebellion of unconscious forces.

B. A warped sense of priorities leaves the Work vulnerable to a setback.

C. Self-centeredness invites defensive or hostile responses.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-THREE –
RESOLUTENESS

Other titles: Break-through, The Symbol of Decision, Resolution,
Determination, Parting, Removing Corruption, Eradication

Judgment

Legge: Recognizing the risks involved in criminal prosecution, justice demands a
resolute proof of the culprit's guilt in the royal court. One informs one's own city
that armed force is not necessary. In this way progress is assured.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Break-through. One must resolutely make the matter
known at the court of the king. It must be announced truthfully. Danger. It is
necessary to notify one's own city. It does not further to resort to arms. It
furthers one to undertake something.

Blofeld: Resolution. When a proclamation is made at the court of the King,
frankness in revealing the true state of affairs is dangerous. [In vital matters,
frankness may prove dangerous.] In making announcements to the people of his
own city, it is not fitting for the ruler to carry arms. [It is better to repose trust in
our own people.] It is favorable to have some goal (or destination).

Liu: Determination. Someone is proud in the king's court, and the king trusts
him. If one exposes the truth, danger. It must be told to one's own people. Using
force does not benefit. It does benefit to do something else. [You must decide how
to deal with a situation before it reaches a dangerous point, or things will take
their own course and overwhelm you.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Parting, displaying tending-towards kingly chambers.
Conforming, crying-out, possessing adversity. Notifying originates from the
capital. Not Harvesting: approaching arms. Harvesting: possessing directed
going. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of separation and
diverging directions. It emphasizes that resolutely dividing your energies is the
adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Resolution: Raised up at the royal court, returning crying out;
there is danger. Announcing from the sky; not beneficial to regulate the
belligerents; beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): Parting is lauded in the royal court. The call of truth involves
danger. Addressing one’s own domain, it is not beneficial to go right to war, but it
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

is beneficial to go somewhere. [The royal court is the abode of the mind-ruler,
where true and false are distinguished.]

Cleary (2): Decision is brought up in the royal court. A sincere statement
involves danger, etc.

Wu: Eradication indicates a conceited pronouncement in the royal court on
the one hand, and a concerted call for vigilance on the other. It is essential to
make the danger known to the people, but not to resort to force now. It is
advantageous to have undertakings.

The Image

Legge: The image of the waters of a marsh mounting over heaven forms
Resoluteness. The superior man, in accordance with this, does not hoard his
wealth, but shares it with his subordinates.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The lake has risen up to heaven: the image of Break-
through. Thus the superior man dispenses riches downward and refrains from
resting on his virtue.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a marshy lake being drawn (sucked)
towards the sky. The Superior Man distributes his emoluments to those below;
dwelling in virtue, he renounces them.

Liu: The lake ascends to heaven, symbolizing Determination. The superior
man distributes wealth below him, without displaying his favors.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh with-respect-to heaven. Parting. A chun tzu
uses spreading-out benefits to extend to the below. A chun tzu uses residing-in
actualizing tao, by- consequence keeping-aloof. [Actualize-tao: Ability to
follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos... Linked with
acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Moisture ascends to heaven, which parts with it. Thus do superior
people distribute blessings to reach those below, while avoiding presumption of
virtue. [After people get mixed up in temporal conditioning, the discriminatory
consciousness takes charge of affairs; wine and sex distract them from reality,
the lure of wealth deranges their nature, emotions and desires well forth at
once, thoughts and ruminations arise in a tangle, and the mind-ruler is lost in
confusion. Because habituation becomes second nature over a long period of
time, it cannot be abruptly removed. It is necessary to work on the matter in a
serene and equanimous way, according to the time: Eventually discrimination
will cease, and the original spirit will return; the human mind will sublimate
and the mind of Tao will be complete – again you will see the original self.]

Cleary (2): ... If they presumed on their virtue, they would be resented.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

Wu: The marsh rises to heaven; this is Eradication. Thus the jun zi distributes
his emolument to those below and is loath to monopolize virtues.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Resoluteness is the symbol of displacing or removing. We
see the dynamic lines displacing the magnetic line. The figure displays the
attributes of Strength and Cheerfulness. There is displacement, but harmony
continues. The exhibition of the criminal's guilt in the royal court is shown by the
magnetic line mounted on five dynamic lines. The awareness of danger and
appeal for justice makes the matter clear. If he has recourse to arms, what he
prefers will soon be exhausted. When the advance of the dynamic lines is
complete, there will be an end to displacement.

Legge: Resoluteness represents the third month when the last vestige of
winter, represented by the sixth line, is about to disappear before the advance of
summer. The single yin line at the top symbolizes an inferior man, a feudal
prince or high minister who is corrupting the government. The five yang lines
below are the representatives of good order. The lesson of the hexagram is how
to remove corruption from the kingdom. He who would do this must do so by the
force of his character more than the force of arms. Never forgetting the
dangerous nature of his undertaking, he must openly denounce the criminal in
the court and awaken general sympathy to his cause. Among his own adherents
("In his own city") he must prevent any tendency to resort to armed conflict. As a
worthy statesman he is not motivated by private feelings.

Hu Ping-wen says: "If but a single inferior man is left, he is sufficient to
make the superior man anxious; if but a single inordinate desire be left in the
mind, that is sufficient to disturb the harmony of the heavenly principles. The
eradication in both cases must be complete, before the labor is ended."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Resoluteness involves astute discernment of what is wrong and a
discreet re-establishment of order without polarizing the situation. Be clear in
your own strategy, but let common sense be your guide about how much you
need to disclose to others. Avoid aggression at all costs.

The Superior Man maintains equilibrium by distributing his energy equitably -

    he smoothes things out.

The forty-third hexagram is an image of the eradication of an inferior force
from the situation at hand: five yang lines resolutely advance on the single yin
line, which is about to be pushed out of the hexagram at the top. This is a
negative image of the twenty-third hexagram, Disintegration, which shows the
opposite situation of five lower yin lines undermining one upper yang line. It is
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

instructive to compare the nearly identical message for the superior man in the
Images of each of these figures. The idea is one of fostering an equitable
distribution of energy within the situation -- Disintegration and the
Resoluteness required to rectify it are extreme situations requiring extreme
measures. Such extremes must always be neutralized through a justly distributed
balance of forces.

It's not the concern of law that any one class in the city fare exceptionally
well, but it contrives to bring this about for the whole city, harmonizing
the citizens by persuasion and compulsion, making them share with one
another the benefit that each class is able to bring to the commonwealth.
And it produces such men in the city not in order to let them turn
whichever way each wants, but in order that it may use them in binding
the city together.
Plato -- The Republic

Compare the nuances of meaning in each translation of the Judgment.
Wilhelm's is most radical, advising a direct (albeit dangerous), expose of what is
wrong. Most of the others imply room for discretion about what needs to be
revealed. Diplomacy is the art of knowing when full- disclosure only prevents
resolution of the problem. Ritsema/Karcher allude to the proper mind-set
required to manage such situations: "[A chun tzu uses] residing-in actualizing
tao, by-consequence keeping-aloof." To "reside in actualizing tao," is to live
directly from one's essence, and when this is associated with "keeping-aloof" we
get an image of quietly rectifying a situation without revealing our purpose or
strategy.

Psychologically interpreted, Resoluteness, like Disintegration,
depicts an extreme situation which must first be rectified, then prevented from
re-occurring through the maintenance of a just balance of power which is
administered by the ego under the will of the Self.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject in the pride of strength,
advancing with his toes. He goes forward, but will not succeed. There will be
ground for blame.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Mighty in the forward-striding toes. When one goes and is
not equal to the task, one makes a mistake.

Blofeld: To set out with a great show of strength, advance, but win no success is
shameful. [That is, we should not voluntarily and somewhat boastfully take on a
difficult task, unless we are sure of success.]
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

Liu: Power in toes moving forward. If one goes and lacks ability, he makes a
mistake.

Ritsema/Karcher: Invigorating tending-towards the preceding foot. Going
not mastering, activating faulty.

Shaughnessy: Mature in the front foot; to go will not be victorious, but will be
trouble.

Cleary (1): Vigor in the advancing feet, going but not prevailing, this is faulty.

Wu: He has strong toes. If he acts in a rash way and is not able to get his job
done, he will be blamed.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Without being able to succeed he goes forward -- this is an
error. Wilhelm/Baynes: When one goes without being equal to the task, it is a
mistake. Blofeld: This illustrates the shame involved in taking on something
and then failing. Ritsema/Karcher: Not mastering and also going. Fault
indeed. Cleary (2): To go without prevailing is faulty. Wu: Acting in a rash way
with no ability to get his job done is a mistake.

Legge: Line one, the first line in the lower trigram of Strength, is in the lowest
place in the hexagram. The stage of the enterprise is too early and the
preparation too small to make victory certain. He had better not take the field.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man presses forward prematurely without sufficient
preparation and strength. Initial setbacks due to blind miscalculations are
grounds for blame.

Wing: Despite strong resolve, beginnings are the most difficult and dangerous of
times. Be certain that you are equal to the task you have in mind. A mistake now
could become an insurmountable setback. Better rethink this one.

Editor: Compare this line with the first line in hexagram number thirty-four,
Great Power, in which an almost identical idea is presented.

"Work-addiction," the "manager disease," the compulsive need of always
having to do something in order to appear busy, also indicates the
inability of modern man to find a meaning in life.

A. Don't force the issue. You aren't equal to the consequences of your
impulses.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

B. "Don't bite off more than you can chew."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject full of apprehension and
appealing for sympathy and help. Late at night hostile measures may be taken
against him, but he need not be anxious about them.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night. Fear nothing.

Blofeld: Though disturbed by cries in the night, he who is armed knows no fear.
[It is well to be forearmed.]

Liu: A cry of warning. One arms at night against the unexpected without fear.

Ritsema/Karcher: Awe, an outcry. Absolutely-no night-time, possessing arms.
No cares.

Shaughnessy: Softly crying out; at dusk and at night there are belligerents; do
not pity them.

Cleary (1): If one is cautious and alert, though there be armed troublemakers in
the night, one need not worry.

Cleary (2): When there is a cry of alert, even if there are attackers in the night,
there is no worry.

Wu: There is a warning of violence at night, but nothing to worry.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He pursues the course of the due mean. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Despite weapons, no fear -- because one has found the middle way.
Blofeld: Being armed and fearless is indicated by the central position of this
line. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring centering tao indeed. Cleary (2): Because
one has attained balance. Wu: Having the central position.

Legge: Line two is dynamic and central -- possessed with determination to do
his part in the work of removal. But his eagerness is tempered by being in a
magnetic place, and he is cautious. However artful they may be, no attempts to
harm him will take effect.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man remains alert to unseen dangers at all times. Hostile measures
against him will fail even at night because of his guarded alertness.

Wing: It is best now to develop a continuous caution and inner strength. Behave
as though you are constantly in danger. Through intense awareness you gain in
security and need not fear difficulties.

Editor: Psychologically, "late at night" is when consciousness is asleep and
vulnerable and when autonomous forces within the psyche are most powerful.
However, this line displays a strength that is balanced and conscientious: despite
anxiety he is able to take care of himself. The line can be a warning to prepare
yourself against approaching stress.

If by setting one's heart right every morning and evening, [a samurai] is
able to live as though his body were already dead, he gains freedom in
the Way. His whole life will be without blame, and he will succeed in his
calling.
Yamamoto Tsunetomo -- The Book of the Samurai

A. Vulnerable, yet protected: "Forewarned is forearmed."

B. Balanced perception protects the Work from the excesses of
unconscious forces.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject about to advance with strong
and determined looks. There will be evil. But the superior man, bent on cutting
off the criminal, will walk alone and encounter the rain, till he be hated by his
proper associates as if he were contaminated by the others. In the end there will
be no blame against him.

Wilhelm/Baynes: To be powerful in the cheekbones brings misfortune. The
superior man is firmly resolved. He walks alone and is caught in the rain. He is
bespattered, and people murmur against him. No blame.

Blofeld: Strength in the cheekbones -- misfortune! [Making a parade of our
strength.] The Superior Man is firmly determined; but if, while walking alone in
the rain, he is irked by the mud, he is not to be blamed for that. [Nothing must
deflect us, but a little grumbling at unpleasantness is in order.]
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

Liu: To display too much strength in the face -- misfortune. The superior man is
determined. He walks alone through the rain. He gets wet. He is unhappy. No
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Invigorating tending-towards the cheek- bones: Possessing
a pitfall. A chun tzu: Parting, Parting. Solitary going, meeting rain. Like soaking,
possessing indignation. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Mature in the cheekbones; there is inauspiciousness. The
gentleman so broken-up moves alone, meeting rain that is like moistening; there
are hot springs; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Vigor in the face has bad luck. A superior person leaves what is to be
left; going alone, encountering rain and so getting wet, there is irritation, but no
fault.

Cleary (2): Vigor in the face involves misfortune. Developed people part
decisively and travel alone. Encountering rain, if they get wet there is irritation
but no fault.

Wu: He has strong cheekbones. Foreboding. The jun zi is determined to
eradicate the little man. Walking alone, he encounters rain and gets wet. He is
angry, but not to be blamed.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The superior man looks bent on cutting off the culprit –
there will in the end be no error. Wilhelm/Baynes: Ultimately this is not a
mistake. Blofeld: The resolutely determined Superior Man is blameless to the
end. Ritsema/Karcher: Completing without fault indeed. Cleary (2):
Developed people part decisively and are faultless in the end. Wu: (He) will not
be blamed in the end.

Legge: Line three is dynamic, and displays his purpose too eagerly. Being
beyond the central position gives an indication of evil. Lines three and six are
also proper correlates, and as elsewhere in the I Ching, the meeting of yin and
yang lines is associated with falling rain. Line three, therefore, communicates
with line six in a way that annoys his associates. Nevertheless, he commits no
error, and in the end incurs no blame.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man displays his purposes too openly. The superior man does not show
outward hostility when bent on cutting off the criminal, since the time is not ripe
and the inferior man will endanger the situation through countermeasures. He
resolves the difficulty by maintaining outward politeness, avoiding
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

recriminations, and awaiting the propitious opportunity. Although he is
misunderstood and maligned by the multitude, there will be no blame in the end.

Wing: Your struggle against an adversary is one you must approach alone.
Although your entire milieu may be against this foe, the battle is still yours. In
overcoming this difficulty, you may temporarily align yourself with it. This looks
bad and you are misunderstood but you remain without error in the end.

Editor: Rain symbolizes the union of heaven and earth -- male with female,
thought with feeling. It means encountering the truth -- making a "fertile
connection." Psychologically, this line suggests the travail and turmoil involved
in coming to grips with an unpleasant truth or duty. The superior man's
"associates" are those complexes in the psyche which prefer not to cope with the
situation. The misfortune of being "strong in the cheekbones" suggests that
determined action accomplishes more than expressions of righteous indignation.

And he who takes his hand from the plough of his immediate Earthly
duty, (which is a Cosmic and Spiritual duty also, however much
familiarity may tend to breed contempt), will never by that act attain to
his heavenly home in the stars. The furrow awaits his tilling – and until
it be tilled, and the seed sown, and the harvest garnered and gathered in
-- his place remains in Earth, with the added burden of rooting out the
weeds and breaking up the clodded sods brought about by his own
neglect and spiritual defection.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. Bite the bullet and do what needs to be done without making a big deal
out of it.

B. You are stuck with an unpopular but necessary duty.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows one from whose buttocks the skin has
been stripped, and who walks slowly and with difficulty. If he could act like a
sheep led after its companions, occasion for repentance would disappear. But
though he hear these words, he will not believe them.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is no skin on his thighs, and walking comes hard. If a
man were to let himself be led like a sheep, remorse would disappear. But if
these words are heard they will not be believed.

Blofeld: His haunches have been flayed and he walks falteringly, though he
could put an end to his shame by allowing himself to be dragged along like a
sheep. Moreover, he puts no faith in the words of others. [Having recently
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

suffered, we advance with hesitation and are unwilling to accept useful but
rather humiliating assistance.]

Liu: He injures his thighs. He walks with difficulty. If he were to follow
like a sheep, remorse would vanish. People will not believe his words when
they hear them.

Ritsema/Karcher: The sacrum without flesh. One moves the resting-place
moreover. Hauling-along the goat, repenting extinguished. Hearing words, not
trustworthy.

Shaughnessy: The lips do not have skin; his movement is herky-jerky,
pulling sheep; regret is gone; you will hear words that are not trustworthy.

Cleary (1): No flesh on the buttocks, not making progress. Leading a sheep,
regret disappears. Hearing the words but not believing.

Cleary (2): With no flesh on the buttocks, one walks haltingly. Leading the
sheep, regret disappears. The words heard are not believed.

Wu: His buttocks have no skin. He hobbles along. If he would lead away the
sheep, there will be no regret; but he does not trust what he hears.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is not in the place appropriate to him. He hears, but does
not understand. Wilhelm/Baynes: There is no clear comprehension. Blofeld:
Having no faith in the words of others shows lack of intelligence. Ritsema/
Karcher: Understanding not brightened indeed. Cleary (2): Being out of
place. Not hearing clearly. Wu: His position is improper. He does not
understand it.

Legge: Line four is not in the center, nor in a place appropriate for a dynamic
line. He therefore will not be at rest, nor do anything to accomplish the work of
the hexagram. He is symbolized as a culprit who has been whipped. Alone he can
do nothing. If he could follow others, like a sheep led along, he might accomplish
something, but he will not listen to advice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is restless and wishes to enforce his will by stubbornly pushing
forward. But he meets with insuperable antagonisms. Advice to desist and to
follow others is ignored.

Wing: As you continue to push forward, you meet with one obstacle after the
next. Your resoluteness has reached a degree where you cannot stop yourself. If
you would submit to the difficult times and allow others to lead, your problems
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

would resolve themselves. Such advice is meaningless, however, since you cannot
be led.

Editor: The image here is clearly one of willful stubbornness. The harsh
indictment is mitigated somewhat by Legge's Confucian commentary -- "He
hears, but does not understand.” With all of the goodwill in the world, it is still
possible to receive this line, and the commentary takes some of the sting out of it
by saying that you simply haven't gotten the message yet. The Self is a terrible
archetype -- far more like the wrathful Yahweh than the forgiving Christ, and
there are phases of the Work in which no matter what you do, it seems to be
wrong. One must learn to live with this fact.

The Lord leads the willing; He drags the unwilling in his wake.
A. Rothberg -- The Sword of the Golem

A. You create hardship for yourself through your own stubbornness.

B. You haven't gotten the message yet. You don't understand, yet insist on
pushing ahead anyway.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the small men like a bed of purslaine,
which ought to be uprooted with the utmost determination. The subject of the
line having such determination, his action, in harmony with his central position,
will lead to no error or blame.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In dealing with weeds, firm resolution is necessary. Walking
in the middle remains free of blame.

Blofeld: With the tenacity of spinach clinging to the earth, he blamelessly steers
a middle course. [That is, weak but determined.]

Liu: Clinging weeds. Determination is necessary. Taking the middle path. No
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Reeds, highlands: Parting, Parting. Center moving, without
fault.

Shaughnessy: The amaranth burns so broken-up, in the middle of the ranks;
there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Wild burdock root; cut through resolutely. Balanced action is
impeccable.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

Cleary (2): A hill of amaranth; parting with what is to be parted with, balanced
action is faultless. [Here it is appropriate to part with what the other yangs part
with [i.e., the top yin line], but still preserve and nurture it; this is the path of
balanced action, whereby it is possible to be faultless. However, when parting,
after all one does not avoid distinguishing between developed and undeveloped
people, though one still does not forget what is universally the same in everyone

    therefore “balance is not yet obvious.”]

Wu: Like the lead sheep of a flock, he is determined to lead the charge against
the little man. His approach from the center results in no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His standing in the due mean is not yet clearly displayed.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The middle is not yet in the light. Blofeld: Yes, blamelessly
but not brilliantly! [In this situation, we can do well enough, but not very well.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Center not-yet shining indeed. Cleary (2): Balanced action
is faultless, but balance is not yet obvious. Wu: Though central, his action is not
enlightening.

Legge: Purslaine grows in shady places, and hence we find it here in close
contiguity to the topmost line, which is yin. Line five's proximity to line six is
supposed to have a bad effect on him, so that while he does what his central
position requires, it is not without an effort. Ch'eng-Tzu says: "If a man
cherishes a single illicit desire in his mind, he has left the right way." Since five
is the ruler's seat, evil may come to him, and strenuous efforts must be made to
prevent such an evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Uprooting corruption from high offices requires the utmost determination.

Wing: When attempting to overthrow adversaries or obstacles in powerful
positions, great Resolution and determination are necessary. The roots of this
opposition run wide and deep and, unless completely eradicated, it may spring
back to power. A calm thoroughness will see you through.

Editor: Wilhelm and Liu render the other translators’ wide range of specific
plants as "weeds,” which is a much more evocative image of the inferior forces
symbolized in this line. Psychologically, the idea is clear enough: unless one
uproots (brings under control) every remnant of independent (habitual) affect
within the psyche, it will eventually return to harm the Work. Sometimes the
majority Confucian commentary does not seem to apply, in which case Cleary’s
minority Buddhist interpretation (above) may be more apt.

Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden.
Shakespeare -- Henry VI

A. Succumbing to neither despair nor overconfidence, one resolutely
eliminates every trace of inferior perception and feeling associated with the
matter at hand.

B. A balanced viewpoint roots out error.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject without any helpers on whom
to call. Her end will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No cry. In the end misfortune comes.

Blofeld: In the end, misfortune will come without warning.

Liu: Without a cry. Misfortune in the end. [If you get this line you will have
difficulty in a new undertaking.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Without crying-out. Completing: possessing a pitfall.

Shaughnessy: There is no crying out; in the winter there is inauspiciousness.

Cleary (1): No call; in the end there is misfortune.

Wu: He has no one to call for help. It will be foreboding in the end.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is the misery of having none on whom to call-- the end
will be that she cannot continue any longer. Wilhelm/Baynes: The misfortune
of not crying out should in the end not be allowed to persist. Blofeld: This
unheralded misfortune will be due to our failure to persist to the end. Ritsema/
Karcher: Without crying-out's pitfall. Completing not permitting long-living
indeed. [Cry- out/outcry: HAO: call out, proclaim; signal, order, command;
mark, label, sign.] Cleary (2): There cannot be growth at the end. [The five lines
below epitomize the exhortations and admonitions of sages to the strong who
gather together. Here one who is weak is at the top and even though correct is
unable to call forth caution for preparedness, so in the end cannot grow.] Wu:
The foreboding of having no one to call for help will come before long.

Legge: The subject of the sixth line, standing above, may be easily disposed of.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Just as victory is at hand, the man finds no helpers to eradicate the
remaining evil. The evil conceals itself, only to spring up again at a later time.

Wing: Danger comes from a seed of evil in your own Self, perhaps a self-
delusion or conceit that blinds you. Just when you feel you may relax your resolve
and continue without helpers, it will cause you to err. Misfortune.

Anthony: We need not harbor anger or hold onto bad memories to remind
ourself that the situation is unresolved... We must leave correction or punishment
of the evil inferiors to the Sage as this is not our province of action...

Editor: Despite Legge's one-sentence dismissal of this line in his annotation,
there is a great deal of ambiguity here. Notice the range of interpretations for the
Confucian commentary: none of them say the same thing in English and
Wilhelm's is so labored as to be virtually meaningless. These are strong clues
that the text may be ambiguous in the original Chinese. Because Blofeld's
translation of HAO (out-cry) as "warning" makes plausible sense, at its most
neutral the line can depict an unexpected catastrophe. Also note that although
blame is implied for line six via the symbolic structure of the hexagram, its actual
text contains no value judgment, and as a magnetic line it remains correctly
placed at the top. To complicate things even further, the message can be
interpreted as either the elimination or the escape of an inferior force and,
depending on the context of the question, one can meditate for hours to ascertain
what exactly is meant. In a differentiated multiverse, there will always be forces
requiring reconciliation and synthesis: nothing is ever "eradicated.” If this is the
only changing line, the new hexagram becomes The Dynamic, with a
corresponding line depicting the consequences of arrogance.

The shadow cannot be eliminated. It is the ever-present dark brother or
sister. Whenever we fail to see where it stands, there is likely to be
trouble afoot. For then it is certain to be standing behind us. The
adequate question therefore never is: Have I a shadow problem? Have I
a negative side? But rather: Where does it happen to be right now?
When we cannot see it, it is time to beware!
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. The image suggests the disempowerment of an inferior force.
[Quarantine without allies results in elimination of authority or influence. A
negative, inferior force is terminated due to lack of support.]

B. The image suggests a sudden, unexpected misfortune of some sort.

C. The image suggests a demonically stubborn force which escapes
rectification.
43 -- Resoluteness -- 43

D. You are alone without allies in a vulnerable position or questionable
endeavor.

44 -- Temptation -- 44
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-FOUR --
TEMPTATION

Other titles: Coming to Meet, The Symbol of Meeting, Contact, Sexual
Intercourse, Encountering, Coupling, Infiltration by Inferior Men, Adultery
"Contains a definite warning about a person or situation which may appear
harmless but will prove dangerous." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Temptation shows a female who is bold and strong. It will not be good
to marry such a female.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful. One should not
marry such a maiden.

Blofeld: Contact. Women wield the power. Do not marry. [At this time
marriage would be unfortunate; the husband would almost surely be
henpecked.]

Liu: Encountering. The female is forceful. One should not marry her.

Ritsema/Karcher: Coupling, womanhood invigorating. No availing-of
grasping womanhood. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the
encounter of primal energies. It emphasizes that seeing-through your personal
situation as the connection of objective forces is the adequate way to handle it...]
Couple, KOU: intense, driven encounter, at once transitory and enduring, that is
the reflection of primal yin and yang; meet, encounter, copulate; mating animals;
magnetism, gravity; to be gripped by impersonal forces. Primal forces couple in
the inner world, seeding enduring new forms.

Shaughnessy: The maiden matures; do not herewith take a maiden.

Cleary (1): Meeting, the woman is strong. Don’t get married.

Cleary (2): In meeting, the woman is strong. Do not marry the woman.

Wu: Rendezvous indicates that the woman is strong. It is not advisable to
marry that woman.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

The Image

Legge: The image of wind with the sky above it forms Temptation. The
sovereign, in accordance with this, delivers his charges, and promulgates his
announcements throughout the four quarters of the kingdom.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Under heaven, wind: the image of Coming to Meet. Thus
does the prince act when disseminating his commands and proclaiming them to
the four quarters of heaven.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing across the face of the earth.
When the ruler issues commands, he has them proclaimed in every corner of the
world.

Liu: The wind under the sky symbolizes Encountering. The ruler issues his
directives, announcing them to the four corners (throughout his country).

Ritsema/Karcher: Below heaven possessing wind. Coupling. The crown-
prince uses spreading-out fate to command the four sides.
[Fate, MING: individual destiny; birth and death as limits of life; issue
orders with authority; consult the gods. The ideogram: mouth and order, words
with heavenly authority.]

Cleary (1): There is wind under heaven, meeting. Thus do rulers announce
their directives to the four quarters.

Wu: There is wind under heaven; this is Rendezvous. Thus, the sovereign
announces the royal mandate to the whole nation.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Temptation has the significance of unexpectedly coming
on. We see in it the magnetic line coming unexpectedly on the dynamic ones.
Marriage is improper, because one so symbolized should not be long associated
with. When heaven and earth meet together as here represented, all the variety
of natural things becomes displayed. When a dynamic line finds itself in the
central and correct position, good government will nourish all under the sky.
Great indeed is the significance of what has to be done at the time indicated by
Temptation.

Legge: A single, magnetic line enters at the bottom of the hexagram. This is the
figure used to represent the time of year when light and heat begin to wane. In
the divided line we see the symbol of the inferior man, beginning to insinuate
himself into the government of the country. His influence, if unchecked, would
go on to grow and fill the vacant seats with others like himself. The objective of
the Judgment is to arouse resistance to this evil influence.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Temptation is defined here as a sudden and casual meeting with
something inferior -- the divided line is seen as appearing all at once in the figure.
The first line, magnetic in a dynamic place, becomes the symbol of a bold woman
of more than questionable virtue who appears unexpectedly on the scene with the
object of seducing all five of the dynamic (male) lines to herself. No one would
contract a marriage with such a female, and every good servant of his country will
repel the entrance into government of every officer who can be so symbolized.

On the first two sentences of the Confucian commentary, the K'ang-hsi
editors say: "The magnetic line meets with (or comes unexpectedly on) the
dynamic ones. The magnetic line, that is, plays the principal part. The case is
like that of the minister who assumes the power of decision in place of the ruler,
or of a hen crowing at sunrise -- is not the name of shameless boldness rightly
applied to it?"

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Do not unite with an inferior element in your situation. ("Lead us
not into temptation.")

The Superior Man formulates his code of conduct and abides by it.

Wilhelm translates the forty-fourth hexagram as Coming to Meet, and
Blofeld gives it the rather startling subtitle of Sexual Intercourse. There is no
doubt at all that the figure has an aura of illicit excitement associated with it
which I feel is best conveyed by R. L. Wing's title of Temptation, though
Adultery might also be suitable. One sometimes receives this hexagram under
dramatic circumstances, and it serves to dump cold water on a potentially volatile
series of choices and their equally volatile consequences.

When we consider the importance of the proper correlation of male and
female lines in the I Ching, we see that the Judgment in this hexagram can
psychologically depict the temptation to an adulterous union of thought and
feeling. Adultery is a very useful metaphor for understanding the principles of
the Work -- it means union with anything which, in I Ching terms, is not a
"proper correlate.” To adulterate something is to degrade a pure substance by the
addition of an inferior ingredient. The image of a temptation to adulterate the
Work in this hexagram is therefore a warning in the strongest possible terms that
you are vulnerable to some inferior choices.

Consequently by marriages not only the earths but also the heavens are
filled with inhabitants ... The earth indeed may be filled with inhabitants
by fornications and adulteries as well as by marriages; but not heaven.
The reason is that hell is from adulteries, and heaven from marriages ...
When the procreations of the human race are effected through
marriages in which the holy love of good and truth from the Lord reigns,

44 -- Temptation -- 44

then it is done on earth as in the heavens, and the kingdom of the Lord
on earth corresponds to the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens.
Swedenborg -- Apocalypse Explained

The concept of the hieros gamos, or holy marriage, is a ubiquitous
archetype found in every tradition rooted in the Perennial Philosophy. If this
"marriage” symbolizes a proper union or reunion of previously separated
elements, then it follows that the opposite situation: a union of mismatched
entities would be symbolized by adultery. To recreate a primordial gestalt of
perfection out of an exploded multiverse of mixed forces demands that all of the
original pairs of opposites become properly matched correlates. Although any
two opposite genders might feel a mutual attraction, there is really only one
opposite which is an appropriate spouse. In the realm of human relationships
this is evoked in the concept of the Soul Mate. Esoterically speaking, every
polarized force in the multiverse has its proper correlate; it follows that the Work
(in its largest conception) cannot be completed until each is reunited with each.

Indeed every act of sexual intercourse which has occurred between those
unlike one another is adultery... Members of a race usually have
associated with those of like race. So spirit mingles with spirit, and
thought consorts with thought and light shares with light. If you are
born a human being, it is the human being who will love you. If you
become a spirit, it is the spirit which will be joined to you. If you become
thought, it is thought which will mingle with you. If you become light, it is
the light which will share with you.
The Gnostic Gospel of Philip

The point is important enough to bear repeating: psycho-spiritually
interpreted, sexual intercourse and marriage symbolize the possibility of a
unification of forces. Conversely, union with an improper correlate means
adulteration of the Work. This is the esoteric meaning underlying the Hindu caste
system:

When (unrighteousness) overwhelms the family, O Krishna The women
of the family become corrupt; and when, O Krishna, the women are
corrupt, there arises a mixing of castes.
Bhagavad-Gita 1: 41

The "mixing of castes” is, in the symbolism of the I Ching, the union of
improper correlate forces. ("Women,” as we have seen, usually symbolize the
emotional and feeling aspects of the psyche.) We readily recognize that the above
quotation from the Bhagavad-Gita accurately reflects the symbolism of the
forty-fourth hexagram, reiterating the great truth that when emotions make the
choices, the unity of the psyche is compromised.

Added notes, 9/7/10: Sometimes this hexagram is received in answer to
queries related more to a fated (karmic) situation than anything normally
44 -- Temptation -- 44

regarded as “temptation.” In these cases Ritsema/Karcher’s expanded notes on
the ideograms are useful guides: “... gripped by impersonal forces. Primal forces
couple in the inner world, seeding enduring new forms... This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of the encounter of primal energies. It
emphasizes that seeing-through your personal situation as the connection of
objective forces is the adequate way to handle it...”
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows how its subject should be kept like a
carriage tied and fastened to a metal drag, in which case with firm correctness
there will be good fortune. But if she move in any direction, evil will appear. She
will be like a lean pig, which is sure to keep jumping about.

Wilhelm/Baynes: It must be checked with a brake of bronze. Perseverance
brings good fortune. If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.
Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.

Blofeld: The chariot wheel is held with a metal brake. Persistence in a righteous
course brings good fortune. Those with a goal or destination in view will witness
misfortune. However, even a lean pig is able to wiggle its trotters.

Liu: The cart is held in check by a metal brake. To continue this is good fortune.
If one goes somewhere, one meets misfortune. The lean pig that wriggles does not
go any farther.

Ritsema/Karcher: Attaching tending-towards a metallic chock. Trial:
significant. Possessing directed going. Visualizing: pitfall. Ruining the pig,
conforming: hoof dragging.

Shaughnessy: Tied to a metal ladder; determination is auspicious. If you have
someplace to go, you will see inauspiciousness; the emaciated piglet returns
helter-skelter.

Cleary (1): A metal brake is applied. It is good to be correct. If you go anywhere,
you will see misfortune. An emaciated pig leaps in earnest.

Cleary (2): Arrested by a metal brake, etc.

Wu: Staying with a silk spinning machine will be auspicious if consistent. Going
elsewhere will be foreboding. It is like a sow hopping around boars.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The metal drag describes the arrest of the magnetic line in
its advancement. Wilhelm/Baynes: It is the way of the weak to be led.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Blofeld: The weak have to be dragged. Ritsema/Karcher: Supple tao hauling-
along indeed. Cleary (2): The reining of the course of flexibility. Wu: To
restrain the yin’s way.

Legge: Line one represents the Bete Noir of the figure. If it can be halted, firm
government and order will prevail. If she can't be restrained, she will become
disgusting and dangerous. It isn't enough for the carriage to be halted by the
metal drag -- it must also be chained fast to some steadfast object. Internal and
external restraints must stop the evil influence from advancing.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the inferior man has wormed his way into the organization.
He must be held in check energetically; otherwise he will grow disgusting and
dangerous.

Wing: You have the opportunity to put limits upon an inferior element and
prevent the growth of its influence. Do not be tempted to allow things to develop
naturally. If you ignore it, it will not go away but will, instead, become a sizable
problem. Act now.

Editor: Chetwynd, in his Dictionary of Symbols, says that a pig symbolizes
the "dark side of the mother: (she) may be a monster or wild pig, with whom
the Hero has to do battle at the appropriate time, in order to avoid being
castrated or devoured by her." The pig in this line is symbolically identical with
the fish in lines two and four: both represent a kind of untamed extravagance
now unfolding -- primal forces challenging our will and intent to protect and
advance the Work. The situation demands all of our control to prevent
deterioration or loss.

This necessary ego function called willing is also the ability to say "no" to
our drives, to ourselves and to others.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Cease and desist -- bring this notion to a screeching halt right now!

B. “Yield not unto temptation.”
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject with a wallet of fish. There
will be no error. But it will not be good to let the subject of the first line go
forward to the guests.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is a fish in the tank. No blame. Does not further
guests.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Blofeld: There is a fish in the bag -- no error! But it is of no advantage to the
guests.

Liu: There is a fish in the kitchen. No blame, but there is no benefit to the
guest.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping possessing fish. Without fault. Not
Harvesting: guesting.

Shaughnessy: The wrapper has fish; there is no trouble; not beneficial to
have audience.

Cleary (1): When the fish is in the bag, there’s no fault. It is not advantageous
to the visitor.

Cleary (2): There is a fish in the bag, etc.

Wu: There is a fish in the wrapping. This is blameless, but disadvantageous to
friends.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: It is right for him not to allow the first line to get to the
guests. Wilhelm/Baynes: It is a duty not to let it reach the guests. Blofeld:
This implies that we are not dutiful to our guests. Ritsema/Karcher:
Righteously not extending-to guesting indeed. Cleary (2): Duty does not extend
to visitors. Wu: There is no reason to share it with friends.

Legge: The wallet of fish symbolizes line one, which has come into the
possession of line two. With his strength he must repress her advance, and he
therefore assumes the rulership of the hexagram. All of the other dynamic lines
are merely guests. He is the first line of defense, and it is important that he
should prevent line one from contaminating them. The commentaries say that
the lesson of line two is that he should make the repression of the first line his
exclusive work, and not allow it to pass on to any of the other lines.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The inferior element is contained not by force but by gentle means. No
error will issue from such a course. However, contact of the inferior with those
farther away must be prevented. Otherwise, the evil will spread.

Wing: Keep the lid on the situation. Gently control the weak spots and do not
allow them to show. If they become obvious to others, things may get out of hand.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Editor: Fish are aquatic animals. If water symbolizes the realm of the emotions
and the unconscious psyche in general, then any denizen of this world represents
an autonomous psychic force dwelling below the level of consciousness. A
contemporary alternative for "wallet of fish" might be: "can of worms." Line two
has to deal with the can of worms, chaotic mess, or sticky problem of line one.
The situation is favorable because the fish are contained in a wallet, tank or
wrapper -- not swimming free. Line two is a threshold guardian who must protect
the forces above him from contamination by lower elements. (Compare the VII
of Wands in the Tarot deck.) In some situations, the line can suggest
comprehension of something (a theory, perhaps) that has some substance to it,
but is not accurate enough to be acted upon in its present state.

Without taboos there is no means for training the will or achieving
discipline. The child's experience of being surrounded by taboos cannot
be set down to an arbitrary high-handedness of parents or culture but is
an indispensable necessity arising from a need of the psyche to develop
adequate ego functioning.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Protect the Work from contamination by inferior elements.

B. "Hold that line! Block that kick!"
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows one from whose buttocks the skin has
been stripped so that he walks with difficulty. The position is perilous, but there
will be no great error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is no skin on his thighs, and walking comes hard. If
one is mindful of the danger, no great mistake is made.

Blofeld: His haunches have been flayed and he walks totteringly -- trouble, but
no great error!

Liu: He loses skin on his thighs and walks with difficulty. Danger. No great
mistake.

Ritsema/Karcher: The sacrum without flesh. One moves the resting-place
moreover. Adversity. Without the great: fault.

Shaughnessy: The buttocks has (Sic) no skin; his movements are hither and
thither; danger; there is no great trouble.

Cleary (1): No flesh on the buttocks, having trouble walking. If one is diligent in
danger, there’s no great fault.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Cleary (2): With no flesh on the buttocks, the walk is halting. There is danger,
but no great fault.

Wu: His buttocks have no skin. He hobbles along. He is in a precarious situation,
but makes no big error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He walks with difficulty, but his steps have not yet been
drawn into the course of the first line. Wilhelm/Baynes: He still walks without
being led. Blofeld: Being able to walk without being dragged. [Despite rather
severe trouble, for which we are not much to blame, we shall manage to get
along somehow.] Ritsema/Karcher: Moving, not-yet hauling-along indeed.
Cleary (2): The walk is halting because it is unconnected. Wu: He does not lead
the sheep away.

Legge: Compare this line with line four of the preceding hexagram. Line three is
dynamic, but has gone beyond the central place and has no correlate above. He is
cut off from the first line by the intervening second line, and therefore cannot do
much against her. But since his aim is to repress her, there will be no great error.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Liu: The man is tempted to join with the inferior element. Circumstances
prevent this, leaving him with a painful decision. The position is perilous, but a
clear insight will prevent great errors.

Wing: Although you are tempted to fall into an inferior situation, you are held
back in spite of yourself. You must now resolve this indecisive conflict. Give it a
great deal of thought, gain some insight, and you can avoid mistakes.

Editor: Line four of hexagram number forty-three also describes "One from
whom whose buttocks the skin has been stripped.” Since hexagram forty-four
and hexagram forty-three are upside down images of each other, it is interesting
to note that lines three and four swap places with very similar images. Note the
difference between them however -- in the present instance no blame is attached
to the position. It is a good rendering of the stresses of temptation, of the
discipline required to resist any compulsion. Sometimes the line suggests that
you may only be able to affect the situation in a limited way. At its most neutral,
it's an image of walking a tough path.

But it is to be known that no one is regenerated without temptation; and
that many temptations succeed, one after another. The reason is that
regeneration is effected for an end; in order that the life of the old man
may die, and the new life which is heavenly be insinuated. It is evident
therefore that there must certainly be a conflict; for the life of the old

44 -- Temptation -- 44

man resists and determines not to be extinguished; and the life of the
new man can only enter where the life of the old is extinct.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

A. A difficult position. Cope with care and sensitivity. Don't surrender to
circumstances.

B. You have not yet yielded to temptation and can still escape its
consequences.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject with his wallet, but no fish
in it. This will give rise to evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: No fish in the tank. This leads to misfortune.

Blofeld: No fish in the bag -- this gives rise to misfortune.

Liu: No fish in the kitchen -- that brings misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Enwrapping without fish. Rising-up: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The wrapper has no fish; to be upright is inauspicious.

Cleary (1): No fish in the bag causes trouble.

Wu: There is no fish in the wrapping. If he raises an issue here, it will be
foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is because he keeps himself aloof from the people.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The misfortune comes from his having kept aloof from the
people. Blofeld: Misfortune in the sense of being remote from the people.
Ritsema/Karcher: Distancing the commoners indeed. Cleary (2): The
misfortune of having no fish is that of alienating people. Wu: He is far from it.

Legge: The fourth line is the proper correlate of line one, but she has already
locked horns with line two, leaving four to stand alone. It is implied that this
isolation is owing to his impatience. If he could exercise forbearance, he would
find a proper opportunity to check the first line's advance.

Wilhelm: Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep them well
disposed. Then we can make use of them if we should need them. If we become
alienated from them and do not meet them halfway, they turn their backs on us
44 -- Temptation -- 44

and are not at our disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault. The
fourth place is that of the minister. The six at the beginning stands here for the
inferior, lowly people. There is a relationship of correspondence between the two
lines. Furthermore, it would be the duty of the official to keep in touch with the
people. But this has been neglected. The line belongs to the trigram Ch’ien, hence
strives upward, away from the people below. By doing this it attracts misfortune
to itself.

Anthony: No fish in the tank. Being brusque with others when their inferiors
approach comes from our inferiors. In learning from the I Ching, our inferiors,
which have been disciplined, become intolerant of undisciplined inferiors in
others. This harshness, however, is not a good servant, although there is no great
blame. It is best, however, to avoid alienating others by correcting the envious or
superior attitude of our inferiors. If we have already alienated others, it is best to
bear their dislike with composure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man keeps himself aloof from the common people. He will lose their
help when needed.

Wing: Do not become so aloof that you lose contact with people of lesser
importance. You may need their help and support sometime in the future. If you
do not communicate with them now, they will not be able to help you later.
Misfortune then follows.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, a fish symbolizes an entity dwelling in the
watery unconscious: a drive, affect, complex or insight, perhaps. In line two,
these creatures are confined in a wallet, tank or wrapping, but here they have
escaped confinement (comprehension). Wilhelm/Baynes’ image of a “fish tank”
(aquarium) suggests a container (form) without content: if the container
(hypothesis) “doesn’t hold water,” no fish (viable truth) can live therein. Some
kind of avoidance is indicated because the Confucian commentary tells us that
this line, in the minister's place, is neglecting his duties to "the people,"
symbolized by line one. One way to be "aloof from the people" (either as inner
complexes or persons in the outer world) is to avoid dealing with them -- we flee
difficult situations because we refuse to cope with the stresses they evoke.
Sometimes this is wise policy, here perhaps it is cowardice: we have yielded to the
Temptation of denial: the Work is not furthered when we avoid its challenges.
The line can sometimes suggest that you have misunderstood a previous oracle:
you are "out of touch."

It is not always realized that a large majority of those living in the
physical universe are not really in contact with it at all but are
wandering most of the time in a subjective dream world of their own.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

44 -- Temptation -- 44

A. Something substantive is missing from your capacity to resolve the
problem at hand. What are you avoiding?

B. "Out of touch" -- a lack of insight or imagination. Whatever “the people”
may symbolize in your query, they are being neglected.

C. Form without content: Your hypothesis doesn’t hold water.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject as a medlar tree overspreading
the gourd beneath it. If he keeps his brilliant qualities concealed, a good issue
will descend from heaven.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A melon covered with willow leaves. Hidden lines. Then it
drops down to one from heaven.

Blofeld: The medlar leaves wrapping the melon hide its beauty. Something falls
from heaven. [This is more or less equivalent to hiding our light under a
bushel.]

Liu: The melon lies under the medlar tree. The glory is hidden. Something
(blessing) comes down from heaven.

Ritsema/Karcher: Using osier, enwrapping melons. Containing composition.
Possessing tumbling, originating-from heaven.

Shaughnessy: With jealousy wrap the gourd; it contains a pattern; something
drops from the heavens.

Cleary (1): Wrapping a melon in river willow. Hiding embellishments, being
detached, one realizes the celestial self.

Cleary (2): Wrapping a melon in river willows, containing brilliance, there is a
descent from heaven.

Wu: He uses willow branches to wrap a melon to protect its beautiful patterns, as
if a mandate had come from heaven.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His qualities are kept concealed because of his central and
correct position. His aim does not neglect the ordinances of heaven. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It is in the middle and correct. Because the will does not give up what
has been ordained. Blofeld: What is willed is consonant with heaven's decrees.
Ritsema/Karcher: Centering correctness indeed. Purpose, not stowing-away
44 -- Temptation -- 44

fate indeed. Cleary (2): Balanced correctly. Aspiration not disregarding destiny.
Wu: He is central and correct. He does not intend to compromise his
prerogatives.

Legge: Line five is dynamic and in the ruler's place. His relationship to the first
line is like that of a forest tree to a gourd growing beneath it. Force must not be
used to repress or destroy the growth of line one. He must restrain himself and
keep his excellence concealed. Then heaven will set a seal to his virtue. While
mindful of his task of repressing the growth of the first line, he keeps his wise
plans concealed until the time for carrying them into execution. Then comes the
successful stroke of his policy as if it were directly from heaven.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is well disposed toward his subordinates, tolerates their
weaknesses, and protects their welfare. He is modest about his talents and does
not resort to outward show or tireless admonition.

Wing: The superior person now relies upon the correctness of his principles and
the force of his character to achieve an effect. He works quietly from within. His
will is consonant with the direction of the cosmos, and he attains his aim.

Von Franz: “Hidden lines” means in China a pattern of the Tao which man does
not yet know and which, when it becomes suddenly conscious to him after a
ripening process in the unconscious, is compared with the falling of a ripe fruit
from above. So the oracle evidently means that the melon represents a latent
conscious order within the darkness, which suddenly and unexpectedly becomes
manifest. [The Dream of Descartes]

Editor: Most of the translators render "gourd” as "melon” --a fruit described as
beautiful or glorious. The image is of a fruit ripening unseen beneath sheltering
leaves. (Every gardener has experienced the surprise of finding a large fruit or
vegetable which grew hidden in such a fashion.) Ritsema/Karcher say the
ideogram contains the meanings of: "enfold and self, a fetus in the womb.”
Wilhelm says: "We entrust the fruit in our care entirely to its own natural
development. Then it ripens of its own accord.” The line usually suggests the
promise of future reward or sometimes can be a warning not to interfere with a
natural process.

A fruit plucked before maturity rots and gets spoiled. A wound bleeds if
you remove the scab before time, but when the wound is healed it drops
off of itself.
Sri Ramakrishna

A. Don't meddle in a growth process -- allow the situation to develop
naturally.
44 -- Temptation -- 44
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject receiving others on his horns.
There will be occasion for regret, but there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He comes to meet with his horns. Humiliation. No blame.

Blofeld: It rubs against things with its horns -- regret, but no error! [We shall
regret our inability to progress, even though we are not at fault.]

Liu: Encountering on the horns. Humiliation, but no mistake.

Ritsema/Karcher: Coupling: one's horns. Exhausting abashment above
indeed.

Shaughnessy: Meeting its horns; distress; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Meeting the horn is humiliating. No blame.

Wu: He tries to meet the yin with his horns and is embarrassed. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is exhausted at his greatest height, and there will be
cause for regret. Wilhelm/Baynes: At the top it comes to an end, hence
humiliation. Blofeld: Regret owing to the complete exhaustion of our powers.
Ritsema/Karcher: Exhausting abashment above indeed. Cleary (2): The
humiliation of coming to an impasse above. Wu: This is a desperate move from
the highest position.

Legge: The K'ang-hsi editors say: "The subject of this line is like an officer who
has withdrawn from the world. He can accomplish no service for the time, but
his person is removed from the workers of disorder. He does nothing to repress
their advance, but keeps himself from evil communication with them."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: After his retirement from the everyday world, the man rebuffs the low and
the inferior who come to him. He is blamed and reproached for his noble pride.
Since he is no longer active in the world, he is able to bear criticisms with
composure and continues to speak forthrightly without error.

Wing: Even if you withdraw from an inferior element and reject it openly, it will
still be there. You will be thought proud and aloof. It would be more practical and
less humiliating to retreat quietly. Nevertheless, you are not to blame for your
actions.
44 -- Temptation -- 44

Editor: Line six meets line one on its horns -- not as a direct attack as much as a
petulant warning. (One is reminded of how an adult animal might nip or butt an
importunate youngster in irritation, but with no real intent to inflict harm.) It's
an image of a harsh rebuff which, though impolite, is not necessarily unjustified.
Note that although Confucius emphasizes that there will be cause for regret, the
original line ends with "no blame." Since the Self seldom shows much
consideration for the ego's feelings, we must assume that there are situations
when the ego may do likewise with others. At its most neutral, we have an image
of exhausted irritability: unpleasant perhaps, but understandable.

I am a rough man, born in a rough country; I have been brought up in
pine-woods, and I may have inherited some knots. That which seems to
me polite and amiable may appear unpolished to another, and what
seems silk in my eyes may be but homespun to you.
Paracelsus

A. Fatigue and petulance prevent resolution of the matter at hand.
Withdraw from contention for now. Perhaps you are trying too hard to force (or
grasp) the issue.

B. An inferior force repulsed.

C. Could be an "attitude problem." You're tired, cross, impatient, (maybe
scared), and being excessively defensive about your position.

D. There's no law that requires you to suffer fools gladly.

E. A plausible (albeit regrettable) response to being “rubbed the wrong
way.”

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-FIVE –
CONTRACTION

Other titles: Gathering Together, Massing, The Symbol of Gathering into One,
Assembling, Congregation, Gathering, Unity, Accord, Making Whole, Focusing,
Marshalling One's Forces, Clustering, Finished

Judgment

Legge: When forces are gathering, the King goes to his ancestral temple. For successful
progress, maintain firm correctness and see the great man. A large sacrifice brings good
fortune -- proceed toward your destination.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Gathering Together. Success. The king approaches his temple. It
furthers one to see the great man. This brings success. Perseverance furthers. To bring
great offerings creates good fortune. It furthers one to undertake something.

Blofeld: Gathering Together -- success! The King approaches the temple. It is
advisable to see a great man, which will ensure success. Persistence in a righteous course
brings reward. Great sacrifices are offered -- good fortune! [These were religious
sacrifices, but they may be taken to mean that the time has come for us to make
important sacrifices of another sort.] It is favorable to have in view a goal (or destination).

Liu: Gathering. Success. The king attends the temple. It is of benefit to see the great
man; this leads to success. Continuance benefits. Offering a great sacrifice leads to good
fortune. It benefits one to go somewhere.

Ritsema/Karcher: Clustering, Growing. The king imagines possessing a temple.
Harvesting: visualizing Great People. Growing. Harvesting Trial. Availing-of the great:
sacrificial-victims significant. Harvesting: possessing directed going. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of collecting and assembling. It emphasizes that
bringing people and things together through a common feeling or goal is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Finished: The king enters into the temple; beneficial to see the great
man; receipt; beneficial to determine. Using the great animal offering is auspicious;
beneficial to have someplace to go.

Cleary (1): Gathering is developmental. The king comes to have a shrine. It is beneficial
to see a great person; this is developmental. It is beneficial to be correct. It is good to make
a great sacrifice. It is beneficial to go somewhere.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

Cleary (2): Gathering is successful. The king goes to his shrine. It is beneficial to see a
great person; this leads to success, etc.

Wu: Congregation indicates that the king comes to his ancestral temple. It will be
advantageous to see the great man. There will be pervasion, if persevering. It will be
auspicious to use big sacrificial animals in the offerings. It will be good to have
undertakings.

The Image

Legge: A marsh above the earth -- the image of Contraction. The superior man, in
accordance with this, assembles his weapons in readiness for unseen contingencies.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Over the earth, the lake: the image of Gathering Together. Thus
the superior man renews his weapons in order to meet the unforeseen.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a marshy lake rising above the earth. The Superior
Man gathers together his weapons in order to provide against the unforeseen. [This is a
time when foresight is required of us, too.]

Liu: The lake on the earth symbolizes Gathering. The superior man keeps his weapons
prepared to meet the unexpected.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh with-respect-to earth. Clustering. A chun tzu uses
eliminating arms to implement. A chun tzu uses warning, not precautions.

Cleary (1): Moisture rises onto the earth, gathering. Thus do superior people prepare
weapons to guard against the unexpected. [When practitioners of the Tao get to where the
five elements are assembled and have been returned to the source, when everything
acquired is obedient to their will, if they do not know how to prevent danger and take
perils into consideration, eventually what has been gathered will again disperse, and
they will not be able to avoid the trouble of losing what has been gained... “Weapons”
means the tools of wisdom, the work of silent operation of spiritual awareness. When the
primordial has been congealed, it is not subject to injury by acquired conditioning, but it
is still necessary to dissolve the influence of personal history before nature and life can be
stabilized. If there is any remaining contamination, eventually conditioning will reassert
itself and the primordial will again become fragmented. Therefore the work of guarding
is indispensable.]

Wu: The marsh is above the earth; this is Congregation. Thus the jun zi causes the
nation to be armed in preparation for contingencies.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Contraction shows massing for union through Cheerfulness and
Obedience. The dynamic line is responded to in his ruling central place, hence the idea of
union. With the utmost piety the king presents his offerings to the spirits in his ancestral
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

temple. Union with the great man is effected through correctness. The law of heaven
demands a sacrifice. Contemplation of the way forces are gathered shows us the way of
heaven, earth and all of nature.

Legge: Contraction means collecting together, or things so collected. The hexagram
deals with the union between the ruler and his ministers -- between high and low in the
kingdom. This state is to be preserved through the influence of religion and the great man,
who is a kind of philosopher king who meets the spirits of his ancestors in the temple.
Whatever he does will succeed because he is correct and right, and his great sacrifices are
in harmony with the times.

The two trigrams represent Docility and Cheerfulness. The dynamic fifth line has
his proper magnetic correlate in line two -- which gives the idea of union. Ch'eng-tzu says
that the ordinances of heaven are simply the natural and practical outcome of heavenly
principle.

A marsh above the earth must be kept in by dykes -- so the Contraction must be
preserved by precautionary measures, the chief of which is to be prepared to resist attack
from without, and to quell internal rebellion.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Forces are assembling for integration -- focus inward, sacrifice your
autonomy and allow the Self to guide the Work.

The Superior Man pulls himself together to face the unknown and preserve the Work.
“Forewarned is forearmed.”

Psychologically, Contraction depicts a time when inner components of the psyche
assemble for recombination into a new pattern. It is significant that this is the time when
“the king goes to his ancestral temple.” That is, the governing intelligence turns toward
the template or ideal image of the Work as it exists in its consummate state. (See
commentary on hexagram number fifty-nine, Expansion, for further discussion of the
symbolism of the ancestral temple.) If the gathering forces integrate in conformity with
this archetype, the Work is thereby advanced.

He, therefore, who perceives himself to associate with God, will have himself the
similitude of Him. And if he passes from himself as an image to the archetype, he
will then have the end of his progression.
Plotinus

In addition to being a gestalt of future perfection, the temple is the home of the
ancestors: a karmic repository of all that has gone into the Work via the will and intent of
former historical ego-personalities. This archetype of "the ancestors" is described by the
Lakota shaman, Black Elk, in his Great Vision. Note that the "grandfathers and
grandmothers" are present when the people are "walking in a sacred manner" -- i.e.,
conforming to the ideal archetypal pattern of the Work:
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

But I was not the last; for when I looked behind me there were ghosts of people
like a trailing fog as far as I could see -- grandfathers of grandfathers and
grandmothers of grandmothers without number. And over these a great Voice --
the Voice that was the South -- lived, and I could feel it silent. And as we went the
Voice behind me said: "Behold a good nation walking in a sacred manner in a
good land!"

The Ancestral Temple then, symbolizes the Work in progress as it exists outside of
temporal awareness. At death the karmic complexes of the psyche, released from their
spacetime ego-body, assume new configurations in hyperspace in accordance with the
accomplishments of the just completed lifetime. Ideally, the ancestors and their heirs
(choices and their consequences) within the Ancestral Temple undergo purification: this is
what Individuation (the Work) is all about.

At the end of the dying process consciousness divides into the consciousness of
one's parents and one’s children, and then it moves through these modalities, and
then divides again. It's moving forward into the future through the people who
come after you, and backward into the past through your ancestors.
Terence McKenna -- The Archaic Revival

In the multidimensional realms "beyond" our material world, time does not exist.
In some way unimaginable to us, past, present and future are consolidated into an eternal
Here and Now. Thus our choices in spacetime can have consequences in hyperspace
which are inconceivable to us in the current situation. So if the Self (as manifested in the
oracle) often seems to be tyrannically unreasonable, it is arguably because of the ego's
dimensional myopia.

The Spirit ... may know the most violent love and hatred possible, for it can see the
remote consequences of the most trivial acts of the living, provided those
consequences are part of its future life. In trying to prevent them it may become
one of those frustrators dreaded by certain spirit mediums. It cannot, however,
without ... assistance ... affect life in any way except to delay its own rebirth. With
that assistance it can so shape circumstances as to make possible the rebirth of a
unique nature.
W. B. Yeats -- A Vision

Such conceptions of cause and effect seem irrational to ordinary awareness, yet
quantum physicists hypothesize future events which affect the present as well as the past.
The idea is not a new one:

Indeed, the hero of Hebrew myth is not only profoundly influenced by the deeds,
words and thoughts of his forebears, and aware of his own profound influence on
the fate of his descendants; he is equally influenced by the behavior of his
descendants and influences that of his ancestors. Thus King Jeroboam set up a
golden calf in Dan, and this sinful act sapped the strength of Abraham when he

45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

pursued his enemies into the same district a thousand years previously.
Graves and Patai -- Hebrew Myths

Should the ego's choices and their consequences not conform to the Self's intent, a
rather cancerous growth is implied in which dynamic and magnetic forces are improperly
consolidated -- in I Ching terms, dynamic and magnetic are mismatched. Through this
"infidelity" of correlates the Work is thus adulterated and falls short of the archetypal ideal.

That the greatest effects come from the smallest causes has become patently clear
not only in physics but in the field of psychological research as well. How often in
the critical moments of life everything hangs on what appears to be a mere
nothing!
Jung -- The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales

Contraction is a compression inward toward a center. Psychologically, this can be
regarded as an integration of complexes. Once the implosion completes itself, it is
implied that the growth cycle reverses itself to expand away from the center. (Cf.,
hexagram number fifty-nine, Expansion, in which the ancestral temple is also
mentioned.) The following hexagram, Pushing Upward, is the inverse of this one, and
depicts a similar upward expansion of energy.

The archetypal themes displayed here are those of Solve et coagula, Implosion-Explosion,
Contraction-Expansion, Black Hole-White Hole, Day and Night of Brahma, etc.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject with a sincere desire for union, but
unable to carry it out, so that disorder is created. If she cries out for help to her proper
correlate, all at once her tears will give place to smiles. She need not mind the temporary
difficulty; as she goes forward, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If you are sincere, but not to the end, there will sometimes be
confusion, sometimes gathering together. If you call out, then after one grasp of the hand
you can laugh again. Regret not. Going is without blame.

Blofeld: When sincerity (or confidence) does not remain until the last, dispersal and
assembling will alternate. There was a cry, but one reassuring clasp of the hand made him
ready to laugh [Perhaps we shall experience an unnecessary fright] -- no cause for
anxiety. Advancing now will entail no error.

Liu: In the beginning sincerity, later change. Disorder and gathering alternate. If you cry
out, after grasping someone's hands you will smile again. No fear. Go with no blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, not completing. Thereupon disarraying,
thereupon Clustering. Like an outcry, the-one handful activates laughing. No cares. Going
without fault.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

Shaughnessy: There is a return that does not end, but then is disordered and then
finished. It is as if he cries out, one room in laughter; do not pity them; in going there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Having sincerity that is not conclusive, there is disorder and mobbing. If you
cry, in a moment it’ll turn to laughter; don’t grieve. To go is blameless. [This is gathering
in the sense of reforming error and returning to correctness.]

Cleary (2): There is trust, but it does not last to the end. There is disorder and mobbing.
If you cry, laughter is mixed in. Do not worry; it is blameless to go.

Wu: He has confidence, but does not keep it long. He is perplexed about the congregation.
If he calls for help, he will soon find himself holding hands with his friend and smiling. He
should not be worried. Going ahead will be blameless.

Hua Ching-Ni: Even if one has unquestionable sincerity, the correct purpose of the
gathering may not be clearly understood. Confusion may arise. Clarity and order are
brought about by patience, firmness and the demonstrated sincerity of the group. Then the
gathering becomes a happy one. There is nothing wrong. Proceed.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her mind and aim are thrown into confusion. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
The will is in confusion. Blofeld: Alternating dispersal and assembly betoken indecision.
Ritsema/Karcher: One's purpose disarrayed indeed. Cleary (2): Confusion of mind.
Wu: Because he wavers.

Legge: Line one is magnetic in a dynamic place. Her proper correlate is line four, but
they are separated by the intervention of two magnetic lines. The consequence is shown in
the first part of the symbolism. But she is possessed with the desire for union, which is the
theme of the hexagram, and by calling out to her correlate she obtains help. Sorrow is
thereby turned to joy.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man desires union. But confusion and indecision exist because he
is separated from his associates. He calls for help, which is provided, thereby transforming
distress into joy.

Wing: Your hesitation to fully unite with others and make a commitment to shared goals
creates indecision in your life. Only by penetrating to the center will you resolve this
problem. Locate the leader or central compelling force. If you ask for help now you will
receive it.

Editor: The image here is one of indecisive confusion which can only be resolved by
making a proper connection. This line often refers to your lack of confidence in making
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

proper choices related to the Work -- sometimes a crisis of faith in the Work itself is
implied.

To be born as a human being is a privilege, according to the Buddha's teaching,
because it offers the rare opportunity of liberation through one's own decisive
effort, through a "turning-about in the deepest seat of consciousness..."
W.Y. Evans-Wentz -- The Tibetan Book of the Dead

A. Good intentions can't replace effort -- your heart is in the right place, but you
need to make some necessary connections to achieve your goal. Pull yourself together.

B. Confusion demands the re-establishment of equilibrium; making a connection
leads to accord. Seek appropriate assistance.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject led forward by her correlate. There
will be good fortune, and freedom from error. There is entire sincerity, and in that case
even the small offerings of the vernal sacrifice are acceptable.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Letting oneself be drawn brings good fortune and remains blameless.
If one is sincere, it furthers one to bring even a small offering.

Blofeld: Being drawn into something brings good fortune and no error is involved. Be
confident and win advantage from making a sacrifice.

Liu: If you are introduced to something -- good fortune. No blame. If you are sincere,
even a simple offering will be blessed.

Ritsema/Karcher: Protracting significant, without fault. Conforming, thereupon
Harvesting availing-of-dedicating.

Shaughnessy: Extended auspiciousness; there is no trouble. Returning then beneficial to
use the spring sacrifice.

Cleary (1): Drawing in brings good fortune; no blame. If one is sincere, it is beneficial to
perform the spring ceremony.

Cleary (2): Drawing out is good and blameless. If trusted, it is beneficial to perform a
ceremony.

Wu: Good fortune is introduced. There will be no error. With sincerity, he has the
privilege of making offerings in the summer.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The virtue proper to her central place has not undergone any change.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The middle is still unchanged. Blofeld: The constant nature of this
line, which is central. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering, not-yet transforming indeed.
Cleary (2): Balance has not changed. Wu: His central position has not changed.

Legge: Line two is in her proper place, and responds to the dynamic ruler in five, who
encourages and helps her advance. She possesses the sincerity proper to her central
position, and though able to offer only the sacrifice of spring, which is small compared to
the summer and autumn sacrifices, it will be appreciated.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Secret forces are bringing compatible spirits together. If the man permits himself to
be led by this ineffable attraction, good fortune will come his way. When deep friendships
exist, formalities and elaborate preparations are not necessary.

Wing: You may feel mysteriously drawn to certain people or endeavors, although this may
not be what you had planned for yourself. Give in to this impulse. Larger and invisible
forces are at work here, and good fortune will come by submitting to them.

Anthony: We must not allow pride, pity or other emotions to cause us to structure how
things are to work out ... We need not strive, but let ourself be drawn.

Editor: To be led forward by one's correlate, in this case the fifth line ruler, is to be guided
by the Self. Cirlot, in his Dictionary of Symbols, says: "To sacrifice what is esteemed
is to sacrifice oneself, and the spiritual energy thereby acquired is proportional to the
importance of what is lost. All forms of suffering can be sacrificial, if fully and
wholeheartedly sought and accepted." The line is an image of sacrificing one's ego
interests to follow a superior guiding force.

Fear of self-sacrifice lurks deep in every ego, and this fear is often only the
precariously controlled demand of the unconscious forces to burst out in full
strength. No one who strives for selfhood (individuation) is spared this dangerous
passage, for that which is feared also belongs to the wholeness of the self -- the
sub- human, or supra-human, world of psychic "dominants" from which the ego
originally emancipated itself with enormous effort, and then only partially, for
the sake of a more or less illusory freedom. This liberation is certainly a very
necessary and very heroic undertaking, but it represents nothing final: it is
merely the creation of a subject, who, in order to find fulfillment, has still to be
confronted by an object.
Jung -- Commentary in the Tibetan Book of the Dead

A. Sacrifice your autonomy for the good of the whole.

B. Sacrifice to make a connection.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows it subject striving after union and seeming to sigh,
yet nowhere finding any advantage. If she go forward, she will not err, though there may
be some small cause for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Gathering together amid sighs. Nothing that would further. Going is
without blame. Slight humiliation.

Blofeld: A mournful gathering it would seem. There is no objective which would be
favorable; yet to advance would involve no error, only slight regret. [Obviously we had
better not advance now, unless our reasons for doing so are so important that we are
willing to suffer a certain amount of regret.]

Liu: Gathering with deep sighs. No benefit for an undertaking. Go with no blame. Slight
humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Clustering thus, lamenting thus. Without direction: Harvesting.
Going without fault. The small abashed. [Without direction: Harvesting, WU YU
Li: no plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation,
do not impose a direction on events.]

Shaughnessy: Finished-like, sighing-like; there is no place beneficial; in going there is
no trouble; small distress.

Cleary (1): Gathering, lamenting; no benefit. If one goes, there is no fault, but a little
shame.

Wu: He wishes to be with others, but feels sorry that he cannot be. There is no advantage
on insisting on going. If he goes ahead, there will be no serious setback, but little
embarrassment.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the subject of the top line there is humility and condescension.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The Gentle is above. Blofeld: Advancing entails no error for what
lies beyond is gentle. Ritsema/Karcher: Ground above indeed. Cleary (2): The one
above is willing. Wu: The one above is likely to grant entry.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place and advanced past the center. The
topmost line is not a proper correlate. Line three is possessed by the desire for union, and
though lines two and four decline to associate with her, she presses on to line six, which is
also desirous of union. That common desire brings them together despite the fact that
they are both magnetic lines. It is therefore with difficulty that three accomplishes her
object.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attempts to join with others. But the enveloping circle excludes him. He
should resolutely seek to ally himself with a man near the center of the group, who will
bring him in. Some humiliation may occur at first, but this is not a mistake.

Wing: A desire for unity is thwarted. The group is closed and you will feel humiliated if
you continue in your attempts to penetrate it. If it is terribly important to you, you can
achieve your aim by aligning yourself with an influential member of the group.

Editor: Wilhelm's Confucian commentary portrays "The Gentle" lying above -- which
implies that magnetic or receptive forces sympathize with the difficult situation here
symbolized. The image suggests the frustration of being unable to make any progress in
forging a connection, solving a problem, or effecting a union. It can also depict a less than
ideal situation which can only be tolerated for now.

Everything good is costly, and the development of personality is one of the most
costly of all things. It is a matter of saying yea to oneself, of taking oneself as the
most serious of tasks, of being conscious of everything one does, and keeping it
constantly before one's eyes in all its dubious aspects -- truly a task that taxes us
to the utmost.
Jung -- The Secret of the Golden Flower

A. Work to make a connection.

B. You have missed the point, but don't feel badly about it -- keep trying.

C. “In order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on
events."
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject in such a state that, if he is greatly
fortunate, he will receive no blame.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Great good fortune. No blame. [This describes a man who gathers
people around him in the name of his ruler. Since he is not striving for any special
advantages for himself but is working unselfishly to bring about general unity, his work
is crowned with success, and everything becomes as it should be.]

Blofeld: Great good fortune and no error!

Liu: Great good fortune. No blame. (But the position is not correct.) [Incorrect behavior
breeds trouble.]
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

Ritsema/Karcher: The great significant, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Great auspiciousness; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Great fortune, no fault.

Cleary (2): If there is great good fortune, then there is no blame.

Wu: Great auspiciousness. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His position is not the proper one to him. Wilhelm/Baynes: For
the place demands nothing. [Footnote by C.F. Baynes: "The Chinese text reads
literally, ‘The place is not correct.’ Wilhelm's translation follows suggestions of the
Chinese commentators."] Blofeld: Because the line, though a firm one, is not in the
ruling position. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2):
There is no blame only if there is great good fortune, because one is out of place. Wu: He
is out of place.

Legge: Line four has his correlate in line one, and he is next to the ruler in line five. We
may expect a good auspice for him. Because he is dynamic in a magnetic place caution is
intimated.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man rallies the people to the country's service. This brings good fortune to
himself, though he does not actively seek it.

Wing: In this position you gather with others to serve a larger goal. Such sacrifice will
meet with personal success.

Anthony: Sometimes in striving for unity, we find it necessary to go alone, with our acts
being misunderstood. However, because we work unselfishly to bring about general unity,
our work is ultimately successful.

Editor: Note that this line (minus the Confucian commentary) is unambiguously
favorable. Line four and the ruler above him are the only yang lines in the hexagram, and
since the idea of the figure is the focusing of disparate forces for union, we can think of
these parallel lines as the hexagram's "lenses," or focal points. Although dynamic in a
magnetic place, if line four abides correctly all will be fortunate. This suggests a kind of
passive virtue which attracts devotion, inspires emulation or draws higher energy into the
situation without acting itself. A proper ego/Self relationship may be inferred from this.
Liu, who usually does not translate the Confucian commentary, here includes it in
parenthesis. In contrast to the other translators, his personal commentary is negative.
Cleary’s Confucian commentary rationalizes the seeming anomaly.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

I have come to know myself, and I have collected myself from everywhere, and I
have not sown children to the Archon but have uprooted his roots and have
collected the dispersed members, and I know thee who thou art: for I am of those
from above.
Epiphanius -- Panarion Haeresium 26. 13

A. You're sitting pretty: don't push your luck.

B. “Handsome is as handsome does."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the union of all under its subject in the place of
dignity. There will be no error. If any have no confidence in him, let him see to it that his
virtue is great, long-continued, and firmly correct, and all occasion for repentance will
disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If in gathering together one has position, this brings no blame. If
there are some who are not yet sincerely in the work, sublime and enduring perseverance
is needed. Then remorse disappears.

Blofeld: On account of his high position, he gathers people together -- no error! Yet he
cannot secure the confidence of the people; therefore he should exalt his virtue and
prolong his persistence so that he need no longer feel regret. [All this is said of a minister;
applied to ourselves, it suggests that we need people's confidence now and should strive
hard to deserve it.]

Liu: If one has position, people will gather. No blame. If he does not have the trust of all,
he should perpetuate his magnanimity. Remorse will vanish.

Ritsema/Karcher: Clustering: possessing the situation. Without fault: in-no-way
conforming. Spring, perpetual Trial. Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: In finishing there is position; there is no trouble. It is not a return; prime
permanent determination; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): Gathering, there is a state without fault. Not taking oneself seriously, if one is
basically always correct, regret will disappear. [If one knows how to fill the belly and also
empty the mind, practices non-doing and incubates the spiritual embryo, ever correct
and undivided, using the natural true fire to melt away the residual mundanity of
acquired conditioning, such a one is called a true human without taint – how could
regret not vanish? This is gathering in the sense of incubating the spiritual embryo.]

Cleary (2): Gathering around the position, there is no blame. If those who are not loyal
remain ever-faithful to their original commitment, regret vanishes. [If one just relies on
one’s position and expects others to gather around, one’s aspiration is not yet glorious.]
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

Wu: He is in place in Congregation and in no error. But lacking the full confidence of his
people, he should forever remain persevering to dispel regret. [We may consider this [line]
as an amendment to the judgment of the hexagram. An important ingredient of the
congregation is moral authority. In its absence or lacking of it, the grandiose show is
merely a fanfare. It makes no lasting impression on the people.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Although there is union in the place of dignity, his mind and aim have
not yet been brilliantly displayed. Wilhelm/Baynes: If in gathering together one has
only position, the will does not yet shine forth sufficiently. Blofeld: It is only on account
of his high position that he is able to assemble the people; his will is not strong enough to
achieve remarkable results from this. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose not-yet shining indeed.
Cleary (2): One’s aspiration is not yet glorious. Wu: His aspirations are not enlightening.

Legge: Line five is dynamic, central, and in his correct position. Through him there may
be expected the full realization of the idea of the hexagram, though the fact that
"his mind and aim have not yet been brilliantly displayed" indicates that some may even
still not have confidence in him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Although the people unite under the man's leadership, certain difficulties remain.
His aims have not been clearly explained, and his thinking is beyond the comprehension of
all. Some followers stay with him because of his influential position. If he remains
steadfast in his virtues so far as practically possible, he will eventually dissipate these
uncertainties.

Wing: The person in this position has a great deal of power and influence within the
group. Many attach themselves to him because of this. He must further prove his virtues
and qualities of leadership in order to gain the true confidence of the group. In doing so he
can accomplish his aims.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the image depicts forces (unconscious complexes)
assembling for integration. Conditions are less than optimum for complete transformation
however, and a concentration of will and intent is required. The outcome may be dubious:
if this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created is Enthusiasm, with a
corresponding line portraying a chronic ailment. The ego’s concentration on the task at
hand is not as strong as it could be. Sometimes (rarely perhaps) the line can depict a
coerced concentration of energy needful to complete a specific task. It goes without saying
that compulsory integrations seldom endure, yet when mandated by the Self, such
expedience may be necessary. In its most negative sense, this can portray a "hostile
takeover."

Separation into apparently dissimilar things, such as heaven, the elements, man,
etc., was necessary only for the work of generation. Everything separated must

45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45

be united again in the production of the [philosopher's] stone, so that the original
state of unity shall be restored. But, says Dorn [an alchemist], "Thou wilt never
make from others the One which thou seekest, except first there be made one thing
of thyself."
Jung -- Aion

A. You have gathered your forces, yet haven't gained full mastery over them.
Unswerving devotion to the Work and refusal to yield to temptation should eventually
bring success.

B. You can force the issue, but don't expect it to last for long. (Nevertheless, this
may be necessary in the present circumstances.)
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject sighing and weeping; but there will be
no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears. No blame.

Blofeld: Sighs and lamentations, but no error. [We shall be afflicted by distress, but
through no fault of our own.]

Liu: Lamentation and deep sighing, with tears from the eyes and dribbling from the nose.
No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Paying-tribute: sighs, tears, snot. The above not-yet quiet indeed.

Shaughnessy: Snuffling tears and snivel; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Sighing and weeping. No blame.

Wu: He is weeping and sniffling. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She sighs and weeps. She does not yet rest in her topmost position.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He is not tranquil at the top. Blofeld: For this top line presages
distress. Ritsema/Karcher: The above not-yet quiet indeed. Cleary (2): [This is
because of] not being comfortable at the top. Wu: He is uneasy to be in the top position.

Legge: Line six is magnetic and at the extremity of the figure, yet still anxious for union.
But she has no proper correlate, and all below are united in line five. Although she
mourns her isolation, her good nature will preserve her from error and blame. Resting in
the topmost position of the upper trigram of Frivolity she might be expected to abandon
the cause of Contraction, but she cannot bear to do it.
45 -- Gathering Together (Contraction) -- 45
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not remain inactive in his high position but seeks alliance with
another, who misjudges him. He is saddened by the rebuff. But the unity will come
eventually as a result of his determination.

Wing: Any approach toward union will meet with rejection. This will bring you
frustration because your intentions are misunderstood. Turn your attention inward
instead, in order to penetrate the meaning of this disharmony. An inner accord with your
Self will strengthen your position, and unity may become possible after all.

Editor: The image suggests the tension of an incomplete synthesis, or a failure due to lack
of capacity rather than wrong intent. Ritsema/Karcher translate "snot" as: "YI: mucous
from the nose; snivel, whine." The line can sometimes just mean that the Work is often
unpleasant and difficult, and sorrow is a natural and not blameworthy response to it.

There is no light without shadow and no psychic wholeness without imperfection.
To round itself out, life calls not for perfection but for completeness; and for this
the "thorn in the flesh" is needed, the suffering of defects without which there is no
progress and no ascent.
Jung -- Psychology and Alchemy

A. Although the synthesis is incomplete, your goodwill preserves you through the
crisis.

B. "You can't win 'em all" -- no need to whine about it.

46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-SIX –
PUSHING UPWARD

Other titles: The Symbol of Rising and Advancing, Ascending, Ascension, Rising,
Promotion, Advancement, Sprouting from the Earth, Organic Growth

Judgment

Legge: Pushing Upward means successful progress. Have no anxiety about meeting
with the great man. An advance to the south is fortunate.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Pushing Upward has supreme success. One must see the great
man. Fear not. Departure toward the south brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Ascending. Supreme success! It is essential to see a great man, so as to banish
anxiety. Progressing towards the south brings good fortune.

Liu: Ascending. Great Success. One should see a great man. Without fear. An
expedition to the south leads to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Ascending, Spring Growing. Availing-of visualizing Great People.
No cares. The South, chastising significant. [This hexagram describes your situation in
terms of rising to a higher level. It emphasizes that setting a higher goal and working
toward it step by step is the adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time,
you are told to: ascend!]

Shaughnessy: Ascending: Prime receipt; beneficial to see the great man. Do not pity.
For the southern campaign, auspicious.

Cleary(1): Rising is greatly developmental; it calls for seeing a great person, so there
will be no grief. An expedition south brings good fortune.

Cleary (2): Rising is very successful, etc.

Wu: Ascension indicates great pervasion. It will be useful to see the great man. No
anxiety. It will be auspicious to go south.

The Image

Legge: Wood growing in the earth -- the image of Pushing Upward. The superior man
accumulates small increments of virtue until it becomes high and great.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Wilhelm/Baynes: Within the earth, wood grows: the image of Pushing Upward.
Thus the superior man of devoted character heaps up small things in order to achieve
something high and great.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes tress growing upwards from the earth. The Superior
Man most willingly accords with virtuous ways; starting from small things, he accumulates
a great heap of merit.

Liu: The wood grows in the earth, symbolizing Ascending. The superior man devotes
his virtue to building things up from the small to the high and great.

Ritsema/Karcher: Earth center giving-birth-to wood. Ascending. A chun tzu uses
yielding to actualize-tao. A chun tzu uses amassing the small to use the high great.
[Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the
cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): Trees grow on the earth, rising. Thus do superior people follow virtue,
accumulating the small to lofty greatness.

Wu: Trees grow from earth; this is Ascension. Thus the Jun zi diligently cultivates his
virtues little by little to become tall and large like trees growing.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The magnetic line ascends as opportunity permits. We have
Flexibility, Obedience and a dynamic line below with his magnetic correlate above: this
means successful progress. See the great man -- his will is accomplished in the south.

Legge: The character for this hexagram means advancing in an upward direction, or
ascending. The figure symbolizes the promotion of an able officer to the highest pinnacle
of distinction. The action of the dynamic second line is tempered by being in the magnetic
central position of the lower trigram. As the representative of Pushing Upward he is
forceful, yet modest and the magnetic fifth line ruler welcomes his advance. The officer
therefore has the qualities that fit him to ascend as well as a favorable opportunity to do so.

After he has met with the "great man" in line five, advance to the south will be
fortunate. Chu Hsi says that this is equivalent to "advancing forwards.” Since the south is
the region of brightness and warmth, the progress will be easy and agreeable.

The lower trigram symbolizes Wood, and its weak first line is the root of a tree
buried in the earth of the upper trigram. The gradual growth of this root pushes the trunk
upward as the circumstances of time permit.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Ascend in accordance with the will of the Self. Turn toward clarity.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

The Superior Man grows a little every day.

The image of the 46th hexagram is of a plant growing in the earth, gradually
pushing upward toward the sun. That "an advance to the south is fortunate" means that
as all plants turn southward toward the sun, their source of nourishment, so should we
turn toward the light and clarity of the "great man" or Self within us.

The upward advancement of the Work is an organic process. There is no such thing
as "instant enlightenment." The many stories and parables of instant Satori which are
common in the Zen Buddhist tradition are actually just dramatic accounts of the final few
moments' resolution that come after a lifetime of slow and patient devotion. The Work
progresses at the pace of a tree -- what started out as an acorn eventually becomes a forest
giant, but it doesn't happen overnight.

Remember ever that Mind in its entirety is ever the Builder. For it is step by step,
line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, there a little, that the attaining is
accomplished in the mental, the spiritual, the material applications of an entity in
this material world.
Edgar Cayce – Book of Changes

This slow growth is an accumulation of countless "gathering togethers" as depicted
in the preceding hexagram, of which Pushing Upward is the upside-down image. It is
estimated that an adult human being grows from a single cell to about one-hundred billion
cells through a process of fifty-billion mitotic divisions. It is interesting to observe that
"one-hundred-billion" is the scientific estimate of the number of stars in any given galaxy.
If we apply the Hermetic Axiom: "As above, so below" to this relationship of macrocosm to
microcosm we get the image of our solar system as a single atom in the "body" of a galactic
entity.

That should put the Work into perspective!

Understand that thou art a second little world and that the sun and the moon are
within thee, and also the stars.
Origen -- Homiliae in Leviticum

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject advancing upwards with the welcome of
those above her. There will be great good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Pushing upward that meets with confidence brings great good fortune.

Blofeld: Certainty of promotion -- great good fortune!
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Liu: Confident ascending. Great good fortune. [Indications are that you will be able to
achieve the goal of your undertaking.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Sincere Ascending, the great significant.

Shaughnessy: Really ascending; greatly auspicious.

Cleary (1): Truly rising is very auspicious.

Cleary (2): Truthful rising is very auspicious.

Wu: The ascension is promising and with great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The subjects of the upper trigram are of the same mind with her.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Those above agree in purpose. Blofeld: This is because the will of
our superiors accords with our own. Ritsema/Karcher: Uniting purposes above indeed.
Cleary (2): There is accord with a higher aim. Wu: The ascension agrees with the wishes
of the above.

Legge: Line one is magnetic where it should be dynamic. She is humble and docile,
and those above welcome her advance. As the first line of the trigram of Docility, she may
be supposed to concentrate this attribute within herself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is advancing upward toward those who welcome him.

Wing: Although your position within the situation of your inquiry is low in stature, you
have a natural accord with your superiors. Advancement and promotion are possible
through industrious work on your part. This will give those above you confidence in your
abilities. Good fortune.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the image suggests that forces within the
superconscious realms of the psyche are supporting the ego's action.

The objective psyche, on the one hand, functions independently and regardless of
the ego's intentions; in fact the ego is gradually formed by the objective psyche as
its focal point ... On the other hand, the objective psyche appears to insist on a
continuous dynamic relationship between itself and its focal point in the ego. The
conscious ego must make the effort to relate to the unconscious, its maternal
source-ground, in order to maintain adequate, healthy functioning.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Advance in accordance with the goals of the Work.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject with that sincerity which will make
even the small offerings of the vernal sacrifice acceptable. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one is sincere, it furthers one to bring even a small offering.

Blofeld: Full of faith, he performed the summer sacrifice. [This suggests that faith in
spiritual matters or ancient traditions will serve us well.]

Liu: If you are sincere, a summer offering is beneficial. No blame. [This line indicates
good luck.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Conforming, thereupon Harvesting availing-of dedicating. Without
fault.

Shaughnessy: Returning then beneficial to use the spring sacrifice; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): When sincere it is beneficial to perform the spring ceremony. No blame.

Cleary (2): If there is sincerity, it is beneficial to perform a ceremony... etc.

Wu: With sincerity, he will have the benefit of making offerings in the summer. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The sincerity of the subject of the second line affords occasion for joy.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Sincerity brings blessing. Blofeld: The faith (or confidence)
indicated by this line leads to great happiness. Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing rejoicing
indeed. Cleary (2): The sincerity of the second yang is joyful. Wu: The sincerity of the
second nine brings about joy.

Legge: Compare this with the second line of hexagram number 45. Line two is dynamic,
and the magnetic fifth line is his proper correlate. This suggests a dynamic officer serving
a magnetic ruler. He couldn't do so unless he was possessed by
a sincere and devoted loyalty. In his loyal devotion to line five he will do much good and
benefit many, hence we have the words: "affords occasion for joy."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is an effective but brusque officer serving a weak leader. His upright
sincerity and devoted loyalty meet with a favorable response.

Wing: You can achieve your aim even though you have only modest resources. Those in
authority will be moved by your sincerity despite your lack of traditional criteria.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Editor: Whenever sacrifice is mentioned in the I Ching, it is wise to meditate on the
deeper meaning of the concept to see how it applies to the matter under question. The
situation depicted here shows a dynamic correlate (the "representative of Pushing
Upward" mentioned in Legge's commentary on the hexagram), serving a magnetic ruler.
To be dynamic in a magnetic place suggests one who may be predisposed to impatience.
The sacrifice could be an attitude or belief influencing one to this. If this is the only
changing line, the hexagram becomes number 15, Temperance, so the sacrifice could
also involve pride.

On the psychological level, transformation and sacrifice imply a giving up of some
aspect of "I am," "I have" or “I can," claims and habits, a renouncing of some
cherished needs, convictions or illusions. It may call for a relativization of one's
superior psychological function in favor or the less developed "inferior” function.
A thinking type may have to renounce exclusive reliance upon the intellect in favor
of feeling and emotion. A feeling type may have to learn to subordinate or at least
coordinate emotional responses with thought and reason. An overly active,
driving and controlling person may have to learn a degree of receptivity, yielding
and surrender which, to her or him, may feel like passivity; a passive person may
have to become more actively responsible for his or her own life or therapeutic
management.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing

A. The ego's sacrifices (your pretensions to knowledge? Your impulse to take
action?) are necessary for the furtherance of the Work.

B. A humble offering -- every little bit helps.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject ascending upwards as into an empty city.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One pushes upward into an empty city.

Blofeld: He was promoted to office in a larger city.

Liu: Ascending to a deserted city.

Ritsema/Karcher: Ascending: an empty capital.

Shaughnessy: Ascending the empty city.

Cleary (1): Rising in an empty domain.

Wu: He ascends to the vacant city.

COMMENTARY

46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Confucius/Legge: He advances upwards as into an empty city -- he has no doubts or
hesitation. Wilhelm/Baynes: There is no reason to hesitate. Blofeld: We cause no
doubts to arise in the minds of others. Ritsema/Karcher: Without a place do doubt
indeed. Cleary (2): There is no hesitation. Wu: He has no doubt.

Legge: Line three describes the bold and fearless advance of its subject. According to the
K'ang-hsi editors, there is a shade of condemnation here. He is too bold, "he has no doubt
or hesitation," but is presuming rather on his strength.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: No impediments retard the man's bold advance.

Wing: You may now advance with complete ease -- perhaps too much ease. This sudden
lack of constraint may cause you misgivings. A little caution is a good thing now if you do
not allow it to halt your progress completely.

Editor: Whenever one receives an oracle without the value judgment of "good fortune" or
"there will be evil," it is wise to be especially heedful. This line describes easy progress --
which may or may not be a good thing, depending on the situation. Sometimes it can refer
to making an assumption -- without, however, a clue as to whether the assumption is
accurate! The line can also alert one to something new or unknown: the fact that no value
judgment is appended suggests that a test may be involved.

Many times when I was concentrating on my work and thinking about nothing
else, I suddenly recognized a truth which had no relationship whatever with my
work...At such moments I felt as if my head had just poked up through the ceiling
of one room and emerged above the floor in an upper room. It was a wonderful
feeling to look around with my inward eye in this newly discovered upper room,
inspecting all the hidden treasure lying there.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

A. A sudden upward rush.

B. An image of rapid and easy progress -- don't let it carry you away. Maintain
discipline.

C. You are moving too fast.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject employed by the king to present his
offerings on mount Ch'i. There will be good fortune; there will be no mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The king offers him Mount Chi. Good fortune. No blame.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Blofeld: The King sacrificed on Mount Chi -- good fortune and no error! [This suggests
that faith in spiritual matters or ancient traditions will serve us well.]

Liu: The king makes an offering on Mount Ch'i. Good fortune. No regret.

Ritsema/Karcher: Kinghood availing-of Growing tending-towards the twin-peaked
mountain. Significant. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The king herewith makes offering on Mount Qi; auspicious; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): The king makes offerings on the mountain. This is auspicious and blameless.

Wu: If the king would make offerings to mount Qi, it would have been auspicious and free
from blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Such a service of spiritual beings is according to their mind.
Wilhelm/Baynes: This is the way of the devoted. Blofeld: This indicates our willing
compliance with duty, tradition, circumstances, etc. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding affairs
indeed. Cleary (2): Performs services accordingly. Wu: It would have been a matter of
course.

Legge: This is the place of a great minister, in immediate contact with the ruler, who
confides in him and raises him to the highest distinction as a feudal prince. The capital of
Chou was at the foot of mount Ch'i. The king is the last Shang sovereign; the feudal prince
is Wen. The K'ang-hsi editors say about the commentary: "Such an employment of men of
worth to do service to spiritual beings is serving them according to their mind."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man's progress is aided and abetted by gods and men. The ruler confides in him,
facilitates his efforts, and raises him in distinction.

Wing: Your progress is amplified. It is now possible for your ambitions to be fulfilled.
Continue in your principles and hold to sound traditions.

Editor: This line doesn't lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. Symbolically,
mountains represent a high level of awareness within the psyche. To be employed by the
king to present offerings on a holy mountain suggests actions which are extremely
valuable to the Work, even if you may not understand what is taking place. (Compare with
line 17:6.) Wu’s conditional phrasing here is in accord with a somewhat specialist
historical political interpretation which may not apply in most modern contexts.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Mountains are symbols of the abode of the gods. Consider Sinai, Olympus, Meru,
Fujiyama. Again, they suggest climbing, aspiration, the possibility of attainment.
We all have peaks to climb, and the incentive to action, the disposing element in
our consciousness which leads to volition, has always in the background this idea
of climbing above our present level. Thus the mountain represents what
alchemists call the Great Work.
P.F. Case -- The Tarot

A. A major insight.

B. Ego and Self are in accord. Progress is in harmony with the goals of the Work.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject firmly correct, and therefore enjoying
good fortune. She ascends the stairs with all due ceremony.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. One pushes upward by steps.

Blofeld: Righteous persistence brings good fortune, but the ascent must be made step by
step. [This is no time for rushing forward, but for patient plodding.]

Liu: Continuing brings good fortune. Ascend step by step.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant, Ascending steps.

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious. Ascending the stairs.

Cleary (1): Rectitude brings good fortune. Climbing stairs.

Cleary (2): Correctness is good in raising one up the steps.

Wu: Perseverance leads to good fortune. There is ascending by the steps.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She is firmly correct, and will therefore enjoy good fortune. She
ascends the stairs with all due ceremony and grandly succeeds in her aim. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One achieves one's will completely. Blofeld: Acting thus will lead to the
fulfillment of what we will. Ritsema/Karcher: The great acquiring the purpose indeed.
Cleary (2): The aim is fully attained. Wu: His aspirations are completely fulfilled.

Legge: In line five the advance has reached the highest point of dignity, and firm
correctness is especially called for. "Ascending the steps" may intimate, as Chu Hsi says,
the ease of the advance, or according to others (the K'ang-hsi editors
among them), its ceremonious manner.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: As he approaches the pinnacle, the man guards against intoxication with success. He
steadily advances step by step with the greatest thoroughness and necessary ceremony.

Wing: You are destined to reach your goals through a steady, step-by-step process. Do not
let the coming heights of achievement make you heedless or heady with success. Continue
in the thoroughness that led you to good fortune.

Editor: The idea here is that advancement proceeds one step at a time, naturally and
without haste. Perhaps a dialectical process within the psyche is nearing synthesis. The
line can sometimes imply that there is a need to slow down, or that a more dignified and
orderly approach to the Work is in order.

We are all, at times at least, inclined to feel that the reality of our lives falls short
of our intuitive picture of some kind of completeness. But thereby we lose sight of
the fact that the image of wholeness is itself meant to be a symbolic one,
seemingly never literally or finally to be reached -- a pole star that sets a
direction for the traveler rather than a goal to be reached concretely. The way to
reach closer to completeness then appears to lie in taking each step as it comes in
terms of precisely what it is and at the same time as if related to an encompassing
pattern.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. The image suggests a careful and orderly sequence. Slow down and do it right --
one step at a time.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject advancing upwards blindly. Advantage
will be found in a ceaseless maintenance of firm correctness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Pushing upward in darkness. It furthers one to be unremittingly
persevering.

Blofeld: A night ascent -- advantage lies in unremitting persistence.

Liu: Ascending in ignorance, it is still beneficial to continue unceasingly.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dim ascending. Harvesting: tending-towards not pausing's Trial.

Shaughnessy: Dark ascent; beneficial for unceasing determination.

Cleary (1): Rising in the dark. Benefit lies in unceasing rectitude.
46 -- Pushing Upward -- 46

Cleary (2): Rising into the unknown, it is beneficial to be unceasingly correct.

Wu: This is a blind ascension. It will be good to be ever persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She blindly advances upwards, and is in the highest place -- but there
is decay in store for her, and she will not preserve her riches. Wilhelm/ Baynes: At the
top is decrease and not wealth. Blofeld: But the night ascent will lead to loss, not to
wealth. [Taking the text and commentary of this line together, we may assume that
righteous persistence will win some advantage for us as a result of rather blind progress,
even though we are bound to suffer materially.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Dim Ascending
located above. Dissolving, not affluence indeed. Cleary (2): Rising into the unknown on
high dissolves poverty. Wu: A blind ascension at the top means a loss, not a gain.

Legge: What can the subject of the hexagram want more? She has gained all her riches,
and still she is for going onwards. Her advance is blind and foolish, and only the most
exact correctness will save her from the consequences. When one has reached the greatest
height, she should think of retiring. Ambition otherwise may overleap itself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man advances blindly. Only the most exacting correctness will save him from
unfortunate consequences.

Wing: Advancement without constant re-evaluation and discrimination can easily
become blind impulse. Such behavior will surely lead you into dangerous mistakes. Only
the most careful and exacting conduct can save you from certain damage.

Editor: This line is a clear warning to be extremely careful in whatever endeavor
prompted your question. Legge's translation of the Confucian commentary is quite literal
here: "there is decay in store for her" refers to hexagram number eighteen: Decay (or
Repair), which is the hexagram created if this is the only changing line. Cleary’s version
of the Confucian commentary reads: “Rising into the unknown on high dissolves poverty.”
This seems to be the exact opposite of all the other translations. (Wilhelm’s rendering is
the most succinct: “At the top is decrease and not wealth.”) Cleary’s rendition is based on
Chi-hsu Ou-I’s Buddhist commentary, which states: “When one rises into the unknown,
then one can stop; but if one is unceasingly correct, then one should rise yet further into
the unknown. This is what is called spiritual rank. If they cultivate spiritual rank, people
of low social status are not really poor and lowly – their poverty can disappear.” Since
Chi-hsu Ou-i was not a translator, but reading and writing in his own language, one
wonders how such a seemingly anomalous interpretation of Confucius could occur.
Nevertheless, from the Buddhist perspective the concepts of poverty and wealth are
reversed: “poverty” is wealth, “wealth” is poverty in terms of spiritual value at the top of
the hexagram of Ascending.

I go the way that Providence dictates with the assurance of a sleepwalker.

OPPRESSION

Other titles: Exhaustion, The Symbol of Repression and Confinement, Adversity,
Weariness, Confining, Entangled, Hardship, Depression, Tiresome Restriction, Dried Up,
"Actions speak louder than words." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Oppression means that successful progress is still possible. The perseverance of
the truly great man brings good fortune without error; but if he relies on words, no one
will believe them.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Oppression. Success. Perseverance. The great man brings about
good fortune. No blame. When one has something to say, it is not believed.

Blofeld: Adversity leading to success thanks to persistence in a righteous course; good
fortune for the truly great and freedom from error! Though words be spoken, they will not
inspire confidence. [`Great' refers to high moral qualities. This hexagram is of evil omen
for most people, but success can be won through tremendous persistence in doing what is
right.]

Liu: Oppression. Success. Persistence. Good fortune for the great man. No blame. If one
indicates with words only, no one will believe.

Ritsema/Karcher: Confining, Growing. Trial: Great People significant. Without fault.
Possessing words not trustworthy. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
restriction and distress. It emphasizes that turning inward through accepting enclosure
is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Entangled: Receipt; determination for the great man is auspicious;
there is no trouble. There are words that are not trustworthy.

Cleary (1): Exhaustion develops the righteous. Great people are fortunate and
blameless. If one complains, one will not be trusted.

Cleary (2): Exhausted but coming through successfully, upright great people are
fortunate and impeccable. Mere words are not believed.

Wu: Hardship indicates pervasion and perseverance. There will be good fortune for the
great men. No error. But their words do not make impressions on people.
47 -- Oppression -- 47

The Image

Legge: An abyss beneath the marsh that drains its water -- the image of Oppression.
Thus the superior man will sacrifice his life to attain his purpose.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is no water in the lake: the image of Exhaustion. Thus the
superior man stakes his life on following his will.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a marsh in which no water (appears). The Superior
Man risks his life to carry out his will.

Liu: The lake with no water symbolizes Oppression. The superior man would give up
his life to achieve his purpose.

Ritsema/Karcher: Marsh without stream. Confining. A chun tzu uses involving fate to
release purpose.

Cleary (1): A lake with no water is exhausted. Therefore superior people use life to the
full and achieve their aim. [When people lack purpose their path is at an end. Therefore
they use life to the full to achieve their aim... Using life to the full means to get to the end
of conditioned life; achieving one’s aim means to achieve the primordial life... Using the
temporal to restore the primordial, ending false life and establishing real life, producing
being in the midst of nothingness, seeking life within death, getting through an
exhausting impasse, is like a lake without water again being filled with water.]

Cleary (2): ...Developed people accomplish their will by living out their destiny.
[Developed people only live out their destiny; they do not willingly try to avoid following
and accepting it. Being strong and balanced, they are able to be joyful even in danger;
this is the will that is up to oneself. Developed people intend to accomplish their will and
do not vacillate just because they run into problems.]

Wu: The marsh has no water; this is Hardship. Thus the jun zi is prepared to dedicate
his life to fulfill his commitments. [A marsh devoid of water is like a man deprived of his
intellectual pursuits. This is unacceptable to a jun zi. He would rather fight to the end
than surrender to idiocy.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Oppression we see the dynamic lines covered and obscured by
the magnetic. We see the attribute of Perilousness in the lower trigram going on to
Cheerfulness in the upper. Who but the superior man is still able to advance although
straitened by circumstances? The central position of the dynamic lines explains the good
fortune of the great man who is firm and correct. As regards speech making, to be fond of
argument or persuasion is the way to be reduced to extremity.

Legge: The written Chinese character of Oppression presents us with the picture of a
tree within an enclosure. "A plant," according to Williams, "fading for want of room." "A
47 -- Oppression -- 47

tree," according to T'ai Tung, "not allowed to spread its branches." The image conveys the
idea of being straitened and distressed, and the hexagram indicates how skilful
management may relieve it.

The two central places in the figure are occupied by dynamic lines, but line two is
confined between one and three, which are magnetic; and line five (the ruler), as well as
four (his minister), are covered by the magnetic sixth line. These conditions indicate the
repression of good men by adversity. The K'ang-hsi editors imply that "actions and not
words" are what are required in the case.

Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and Cheerfulness that of the
upper. The superior man, no matter how straitened, remains master of himself, and
pursues his principled intent. The idea of speech making is found in the upper trigram,
one of the attributes of which is the mouth, or speech, as well as Pleased Satisfaction. The
pleading of the oppressed party still tries to make others pleased with him.

Literally translated, the first sentence of the Image reads: "A marsh with no water
is Oppression." Chu Hsi says: "The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above
will become dry."

Anthony: Our belief in the ruling power as beneficial is shaken by doubt. This lack of
steadfastness is a problem because it obstructs acceptance and its corrective power. We
often receive this hexagram when we feel tired. The oppressiveness of doubt exhausts our
inner resources.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: With enough will, success can be won. "Actions speak louder than words.”
(i.e., The answer lies beyond the realm of reason and logic -- intuition furthers.)

The Superior Man stakes everything he's got on his will to succeed.

In Oppression we have the image of a dry lake bed. Anyone who has ever seen
alkali flats in the desert can easily understand this metaphor for Oppression -- almost
nothing can live in such an environment. The following hexagram, The Well, is an
upside-down image of Oppression depicting the opposite case of an unending source of
nourishment flowing from deep beneath the surface of the earth. (A comparison of these
two figures will reveal a great deal about the meaning of each.)

To be under Oppression then, is to be cut off from all sustenance -- although there
is water down below, it is presently inaccessible, and there is no nourishing flow of inner
forces to the surface. This is a common, inevitable and potentially defeating experience for
anyone doing serious inner work:

People who try to practice the Tao can all keep steadfast when they are in easy
circumstances, but many of them waver in determination when they are in
difficult or perilous situations. They may change their minds because of the
47 -- Oppression -- 47

pressures of making a living, or they may slack in determination due to illness;
their spirits may flag because of old age, or they may stop work because of
obstruction by some obsession. All these are cases in which people do not exert the
mind of Tao and are hindered by exhaustion, so they ultimately do not attain the
Tao.
T. Cleary – The Taoist I Ching

Obviously, this is a dangerous situation, and we are told how to cope with it in the
Confucian commentary, where it is observed that the lower trigram of Peril goes on to the
upper trigram of Cheerfulness. These two trigrams are found in reversed sequence in
hexagram number sixty, Restrictive Regulations, where a cheerful attitude is
described as absolutely essential for the furtherance of the Work. The observations made
there also apply here, and we see the superior man thereby enabled to advance under
conditions that would utterly defeat lesser individuals.

This Cheerfulness cannot be underestimated. When it comes naturally and isn't
forced, it is a gift of grace. Suddenly one is enabled to face the most incredible hardships
with a light heart. It isn't that you no longer care -- you still do the best you can to further
the Work, but you do it with bemused detachment.

The one thing the Jewish mystics never lost sight of was the suffering experienced
in the arena of the profane. They did not retreat from this suffering, but sought
instead to find meaning in it by living it. This is the core of mysticism. The temple
in which the sacred marriage takes place is the world.
C. Ponce -- Kabbalah

Lines 2 and 5 specifically mention sacrifice: an important concept in the I Ching.
Sacrifice is mentioned in lines 17:6, 45:2, 46:2, 46:4, 47:2, 47:5, 63:5, and in the Judgment
of hexagram 20. Note that in each case sincerity is specifically cited as essential to success.

Sincere 1: marked by genuineness: as a: free of dissimulation: not hypocritical:
REAL, TRUE, HONEST...

Very often, the “sincerity” of our sacrifices involves following the dictates of the
Work whether we fully understand them or not. Much that takes place in the Work is
incomprehensible to ego consciousness; for example, changes often occur within the
psyche which we only experience as strange dreams. Yet somehow, perhaps months later,
we suddenly realize that we no longer act in a certain way or have lost interest in
something that used to be of compelling importance. Our sacrifices are necessary for these
changes to take place, even if they don't immediately make sense to us.

"With sacrifice shall you nourish the gods; and may the gods nourish you. Thus
nourishing one another, you will obtain the Highest Good. "The gods, nourished
by sacrifice, will bestow on you the enjoyments you desire." He is verily a thief
who enjoys the things that they give without offering to them anything in return.
The Bhagavad-Gita
47 -- Oppression -- 47

Each of Cleary’s Taoist (1) and Buddhist (2) commentaries provides valuable
insights into how much courage is required to follow the dictates of the Work at its more
advanced levels. Take comfort that others before you have persevered and survived:
“Developed people accomplish their will by living out their destiny.”
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject with bare buttocks straitened under
the stump of a tree. She enters a dark valley, and for three years has no prospect of
deliverance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One sits oppressed under a bare tree and strays into a gloomy valley.
For three years one sees nothing.

Blofeld: With dried branches entangling the lower part of his body, he enters a gloomy
valley. For three years he encounters no one. [Whoever receives this line must resign
himself to failure.]

Liu: His bottom is oppressed by the bare tree. He enters a dark valley. For three years, he
sees no one. [This line indicates fear, sadness or mourning.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The sacrum Confined, tending-towards stump wood. Entering
tending-towards a shady gully. Three year's- time not encountering.

Shaughnessy: The lips are entangled in a columnar tree: Entering into a dark valley, for
three years he is not drawn out; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Sitting exhausted on a tree stump, gone into a dark ravine, not to be seen for
three years.

Wu: He sits on tree roots. He enters a lonely valley. He does not see the outside world for
three years. [It is all in his mind. (He) is preoccupied with the thoughts of hardship before
it actually happens.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: So benighted is she, and without clear vision. Wilhelm/Baynes:
One is gloomy and not clear. Blofeld: What is said about entering a gloomy valley
indicates darkness that will not be dispelled. Ritsema/Karcher: Shady, not bright
indeed. Cleary (2): It is obscure and unclear. Wu: His mind is not open.

Legge: The poor subject of line one sitting on a mere stump, which affords her no shelter,
is indeed badly off. The line is at the bottom of the trigram of Peril, and her correlate
fourth line is unable to render help. So stupid is line one that by her own action she
increases her distress. "Three years" is used for a long time.
47 -- Oppression -- 47
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man lacks clear vision and is badly off. He is overwhelmed and has
no immediate prospects of deliverance.

Wing: You are in danger of falling into a trap created by an adverse situation. The trap is
of your own making and comes about because of discouragement. Discouragement creates
a pattern for failure that will continue if not halted now.

Anthony: As long as we are influenced by doubt, we are blocked from seeing the solution.
We must firmly resist doubt and hopelessness to restore open-mindedness. The way out
will show itself at the right time.

Editor: Despite Blofeld's note on this line, it does not necessarily always intimate
complete failure. In the most neutral sense, it's an image of stalemate, though there is a
definite suggestion that this is due to one's own failing in something. Self-pity is hinted at,
as well as lack of clarity. Some kind of illusion prevails. There is a possibility that things
aren't as bad as they seem, or your attitude is making them worse than they need to be.
The line can sometimes indicate that you have misunderstood a previous hexagram.

There are two wrongs the soul commits. The first is its descent; the second, the
evil done after arrival here below. The first is punished by the very conditions of
its descent. Punishment for the second is passage once more into other bodies,
there to remain at greater or less length according to the judgment of its deserts.
(The word "judgment" indicates that this takes place as a result of divine law.) If,
however, its perversity goes beyond all measure, the soul incurs an even more
severe penalty administered by avenging daimons.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. You are oppressed and confined by ignorance; perhaps the aridity of "reason."

B. A self-created impasse.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject straitened amidst his wine and viands.
There come to him anon the red knee-covers of the ruler. It will be well for him to
maintain his sincerity as in sacrificing. Active operations on his part will lead to evil, but
he will be free from blame.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One is oppressed while at meat and drink. The man with the scarlet
knee bands is just coming. It furthers one to offer sacrifice. To set forth brings misfortune.
No blame. [This pictures a state of inner oppression. Externally, all is well, one has meat
and drink. But one is exhausted by the commonplaces of life, and there seems to be no
way of escape. Then help comes from a high place... Here a disagreeable situation must
be overcome by patience of spirit.]
47 -- Oppression -- 47

Blofeld: Difficulties arise through indulgence in food and drink. A vermillion sash-
wearer (man of very high rank) appears; it is advisable to utilize this opportunity to offer
sacrifice. Advancing brings misfortune, though no error is involved.

Liu: Oppressed by food and drink. The man in the red ceremonial robe comes. It is
beneficial to sacrifice. It leads to misfortune to set forth. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-towards liquor taking-in. Scarlet sashes on-all-
sides coming. Harvesting: availing-of presenting oblations. Chastising: pitfall, without
fault.

Shaughnessy: Entangled in wine and food: the scarlet kneepads having just arrived, it is
beneficial to use an aromatic grass sacrifice; to be upright is inauspicious; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): Hard up for wine and food; then comes the regal robe. It is beneficial to make
ceremonial offerings. To go on an expedition brings misfortune. No blame.

Cleary (2): Exhausted, but with food and drink. When the regal robe comes, it is
beneficial to make a ceremonial offering. An expedition leads to misfortune, but there is no
blame.

Wu: He is enslaved by wine and food. He just received a red vestment. It is good for
making offerings. He will encounter ill fortune in having undertakings, but no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Although straitened, his position is central, and there will be ground
for congratulation. Wilhelm/Baynes: The middle brings blessing. Blofeld: The
difficulties arising from our gluttony may nevertheless be productive of blessings.
Ritsema/Karcher: Center possessing reward indeed. Cleary (2): There is celebration
within. Wu: The central position has things worthy of celebration.

Legge: The three dynamic lines in the figure (two, four and five) are all superior men, and
their being straitened is not in themselves, but in their circumstances which prevent self-
development. Hence line two is straitened while he fares sumptuously. His correlate in
the fifth place, though not quite proper, is the ruler who comes to his help. (The red knee
covers distinguish the ruler from those of the nobles, which are scarlet.) Let line two
cultivate his sincerity and do the work of the hexagram as if he were sacrificing to spiritual
beings, and then, if he keeps quiet, all will be well.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is apparently well off but is actually inwardly depressed. He is unable to
solve the ordinary problems of life and develop his basic principles. He is rescued by the
47 -- Oppression -- 47

prince, who is looking for able helpers. However, he must first be patient until the unseen
obstacles are overcome by prayers and sacrifices.

Wing: An Adversity facing you now comes about from boredom. Indulgences and
pleasures may come too easily for you. Try giving yourself to a worthwhile cause. There is
redemption in such altruistic actions.

Editor: The core idea here is that a sacrifice of some kind is necessary to relieve your
oppression. Sacrifice is a universal principle deeply rooted in the unconscious psyche. The
general idea behind it is the offering of something valuable to obtain something more
valuable, which may not be immediately obvious; it is an act of faith and acknowledgment
of subservience to higher guidance. In terms of the Work, this is the ego's sacrifice of its
autonomy to the Self. Here the situation is the seeming contradiction of being oppressed
while surrounded by plenty, so the sacrifice could involve not partaking of what is readily
available. Compare with 45:2, which is created if this is the only changing line.

Sacrifice, "making sacred" (from the Latin sacrum facere) psychologically entails
a surrender of ego libido to the service and intents of the transpersonal
entelechy ... Transformation rests on sacrifice, on making "holy" by giving up
and rendering to the transpersonal, "sacred" powers what one "has" while
remaining what one essentially "is." One submits to change, death and loss of
some aspects of one's being, abilities or possessions, while refusing to "curse God,
and die" (Job 2:9), in other words, refusing to let go of one's trust in life and one's
central core of integrity and Self.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing

A. Starving amid plenty, one has almost made a connection with the source of truth.
Give up your illusions and wait.

B. What you seek is all around you, and the connection is immanent. Have the will
to sacrifice an option to relieve your oppression.

C. You can afford to sacrifice something now in the faith that you'll get something
better later on.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject straitened before a frowning rock. He
lays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone, and leans on thorns
and thistles. He enters his house and does not see his wife. Misfortune.

Blofeld: Faced by rock-like difficulties and with naught to lean upon but thistles and
briars, he entered his dwelling but could not find his wife -- misfortune! [This line may be
47 -- Oppression -- 47

taken to presage insuperable difficulties; the word “wife" does not necessarily have any
special application to our case, as can be seen from the commentary on the line.]

Liu: The man is oppressed by stone. He sits on thorns and thistles. When he enters his
home, he cannot find his wife. Misfortune. [One should be prepared to meet with insult or
difficulty.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-toward petrification. Seizing tending-towards star
thistles. Entering tending- towards one's house. Not visualizing one's consort. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Entangled in stone, and crying out in the thistles: Entering into his palace,
and not seeing his wife; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Stymied by rocks, resting on thorns, going into the house without seeing the
wife – inauspicious.

Cleary (2): Exhausted on a rock, resting on thorns, going into a house but not seeing the
wife is not a good sign.

Wu: He is surrounded by rocks and leaning on thorny shrubs. He enters his house and
does not find his wife. Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: "He lays hold of thorns" -- this is suggested by the position of the line
above the dynamic line. To enter one's palace and not see one's wife is inauspicious.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He rests on a hard line. This bodes misfortune. Blofeld: The firm
line just below him. His not finding his wife symbolizes bad luck. Ritsema/Karcher:
Riding a solid indeed. Not auspicious indeed. Cleary (2): Not seeing the wife is not a
good sign. Wu: An unfortunate omen.

Legge: For a full explanation of the third line, Chu Hsi refers the reader to what Confucius
said on it: "If one be distressed by what need not distress him, his name is sure to be
disgraced; if he lay hold on what he should not touch, his life is sure to be imperiled. In
disgrace and danger, his death will soon come; is it possible for him in such
circumstances to see his wife?" The K'ang-hsi editors say here: "The subjects of the three
magnetic lines (one, three and six) are all unable to cope correctly with the oppression of
their circumstances. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The third line, able
either to advance or retreat, advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to
his family and finds no one to receive him: a graphic portrayal of the results of reckless
action."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is indecisively unable to deal with adversity and is oppressed by something
which should not oppress him. He leans on things like thorns and thistles, which are
hazardous yet cannot support him.
47 -- Oppression -- 47

Wing: You allow yourself to become oppressed by things that are not oppressive.
You put your faith in things that cannot support you. You are unable to see your priorities
although they are obvious. This brings misfortune.

Editor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender symbolism. The rock is often a
symbol of eternity, and is seen as a dwelling place for spiritual beings, hence: a
transcendental reality or "eternal verity." In fairy tales a barrier of thorns is often created
by an evil witch or other negative magnetic force -- the feminine principle in its destructive
aspect. This barrier is usually what separates the hero from the sleeping maiden, his
unconscious anima or feminine soul. A house or palace is the whole psyche. ("In my
father's house are many mansions." -- John 14:2) The wife of course, is the contra-sexual
correlate: in a man, the anima, or emotional-feeling component of his psyche. (A woman
receiving this line should just reverse the symbolism and see it as the animus, or logical-
thinking component of her psyche.) Putting all these symbols together we receive an
image of a situation which is somehow contrary to "the laws of nature." Both the frowning
rock (yang) and the thorns (yin) are opposed to the situation, so no union can possibly
take place: "He does not see his wife." If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram
created is number twenty-eight, Critical Mass, with a corresponding line which
indicates a position of extreme vulnerability to danger. This line is an unambiguous
warning that your situation is untenable -- both dynamic and magnetic forces are against
you. Ritsema/Karcher translate "pitfall" as: "Leads away from the experience of
meaning; stuck and exposed to danger, unable to take in the situation; flow of life and
spirit is blocked..." Wilhelm alludes to "immanent death," which, of course, should be
interpreted symbolically in most cases.

He disowned the God who made him, dishonored the Rock, his salvation.
Deuteronomy 32: 15

A. You are out of touch with reality -- resisting a situation that you should accept.

B. Your ego-indulgence in illusion prevents psychic unity; your action, intention or
attitude is in opposition to psychic unification.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject proceeding very slowly to help
the subject of the first line, who is straitened by the carriage adorned with metal in
front of him. There will be occasion for regret, but the end will be good.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Humiliation,
but the end is reached.

Blofeld: A slow arrival. Trouble in a golden carriage. Shame, but not for long. [Trouble in
a golden carriage coupled with shame suggests that we get into difficulty through our
47 -- Oppression -- 47

presumption, or through placing too much confidence in someone of much higher station
than ourselves.]

Liu: He comes slowly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Embarrassment, but good results
in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Coming, ambling, ambling. Confined, tending-towards a metallic
chariot. Abashment. Possessing completion.

Shaughnessy: Coming slowly, entangled in the metal chariot; distress; there is an end.

Cleary (1): Coming gradually, exhausted in a golden cart; shame has an end.

Cleary (2): Coming slowly, exhausted in a gold car, there is shame, but there is a
conclusion.

Wu: Walking slowly and leisurely, he is distressed in seeing a golden carriage and feels
humiliated, but he will complete his assignments.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His aim is directed to help the lower line. Although he is not in his
appropriate place, he and his correlate will in the end be together. Wilhelm/ Baynes:
His will is directed downward. Though the place is not appropriate, he nevertheless has
companions. Blofeld: The tardy arrival implies that our will-power is at a low ebb.
However, though the line is not suitably placed, it does not stand alone. [At least we may
hope for a little aid from others.] Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose located below indeed.
Although not an appropriate situation, possessing associating indeed. Cleary (2): The
mind is on something lower. There is a partner. Wu: He wishes to be with the one below.
He is responsive to the other.

Legge: Lines four and one are proper correlates, but four is dynamic in a magnetic
place and therefore slow to give assistance. Then line one is run over by line two, which is
represented as a chariot of metal. It is difficult for one and four to come together and
effect much, but four is near the ruler, also dynamic, and through this common sympathy
a measure of success is attained.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man in a high position proceeds hesitantly to help the lower class. He
encounters difficulty in breaking loose from the circle of the wealthy and the powerful. The
original intention of his good resolution eventually brings favorable results.

Wing: Your progress is slowed by your position in the situation. Although your intentions
are good, you are diverted from your path by temptations. There is some humiliation, but
you will accomplish your aim.
47 -- Oppression -- 47

Editor: Most translations render this line as a golden carriage (a luxurious vehicle),
slowly transporting the subject of the fourth line to his destination. The implication is that
our unhurried progress may be due to self-indulgence, but the position is not totally
improper and a delayed relief of oppression is assured.

In each of us there is another whom we do not know. He speaks to us in dreams
and tells us how differently he sees us from the way we see ourselves. When,
therefore, we find ourselves in a difficult situation to which there is no solution, he
can sometimes kindle a light that radically alters our attitude -- the very attitude
that led us into the difficult situation.
Jung -- Civilization in Transition

A. Resolution of the situation is slow in coming: "Better late than never."

B. Illusions of ease and pleasure retard your progress. Nevertheless, mediocre
performance does not necessarily portend failure.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject with his nose and feet cut off. He
is straitened by his ministers in their scarlet knee covers. He is leisurely in his movements
however, and is satisfied. It will be well for him to be as sincere as in sacrificing to
spiritual beings.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His nose and feet are cut off. Oppression at the hands of the man
with the purple knee bands. Joy comes softly. It furthers one to make offerings and
libations.

Blofeld: His nose and feet are chopped off owing to difficulties with a vermillion sash-
wearer (man of high rank), but joy may come in time. It is advisable to offer sacrifice. [It is
very sure that we shall have to suffer bitterly. The joy to come is less certain, but may be
assured by our making a suitable sacrifice.]

Liu: His nose and feet suffer punishment, oppressed by the man in the red ceremonial
robe. Joy comes gradually. It is beneficial to sacrifice.

Ritsema/Karcher: Nose-cutting, foot-cutting. Confined, tending-towards a crimson
sash. Thereupon ambling possesses stimulating. Harvesting: availing-of offering oblations.

Shaughnessy: Doubled rafters; entangled in crimson kneepads, then slowly having
extrication; beneficial to use an aromatic grass sacrifice.

Cleary (1): Nose and feet cut off, at an impasse in minister’s garb, gradually there will be
joy; it is beneficial to make ceremonial offerings.

Cleary (2): Nose and feet cut off, exhausted in a regal robe, etc.
47 -- Oppression -- 47

Wu: He feels as if his nose and feet had been cut off, as he is distressed in seeing the red
vestment. He will come out of hardship slowly and be happy. It will be good to make
offerings.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His aim has not yet been gained. Satisfied leisure means his position
is central and his virtue is correct. Sincere sacrifice means he thereby receives blessing.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not yet attain his will. The line is straight and central. Thus
one attains good fortune. Blofeld: What we will now will not come to pass. The correct
position of the line. Sacrifice in order to ensure good fortune. Ritsema/Karcher:
Purpose not yet acquired indeed. Using centering straightening indeed. Acquiescing-in
blessing indeed. Cleary (2): The aim is not yet attained. Taking a balanced course. One
receives blessings. Wu: His wishes have not been fulfilled. He is straightforward. He will
receive blessings.

Legge: The fifth line is repressed by the sixth, yet urged on by the fourth. He is thus
wounded from above and below, especially the minister in the fourth line with his scarlet
knee covers. But the upper trigram symbolizes Cheerfulness, and this indicates that he
gets by notwithstanding his difficulties. His sincerity helps get him through also.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man's good intentions to help mankind are obstructed from above and below,
especially by the bureaucrats. Gradually the situation improves. In the meantime, all he
can do is to maintain inner composure, as in offering sacrifices to heaven.

Wing: There exists a frustrating lack of information within your milieu. Bureaucracy
stands in the way of progress. Those who need help are stranded. All you can do is
maintain your composure until things take a promised turn for the better.

Editor: The situation of line five is "between a rock and a hard place." The nose
symbolizes intuition -- to have the nose cut off suggests that we have no insight into our
situation; when our feet are cut off, we "don't have a leg to stand on" and our foundation is
undermined. Psychologically, the symbolism implies that the stress of the position is
caused by a higher power: the Self; if so, the stress is necessary to effect an inner
transformation of some sort. We are asked to sacrifice our need to understand the
incomprehensible and submit to the requirements of the time. This line changes the
hexagram to number forty, Liberation, suggesting that through submission to
Oppression one eventually attains freedom.

The death of the physical body is one of the supremer forms of the principle of
Crucifixion. One which equals it is the "death of initiation." This is the
comparatively high initiation where the whole life is dedicated to the service of
the Spirit ... and the initiate instead of dying for a principle, lives out his life in
47 -- Oppression -- 47

accordance with a principle, and this can be a far harder thing ... The Great Work
comes first, whatever the cost.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. Without intuition you have no power-base -- submit to the lessons that a
restricted situation offers you. Sacrifice your ego impulses.

B. You are oppressed by powers outside of your awareness. For the benefit of the
Work, sacrifice your autonomy and your need to understand, and attain eventual
liberation.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject straitened, as if bound with creepers; or
in a high and dangerous position, and saying to herself: "If I move, I shall repent it." If she
does repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in her going forward.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly and says,
"Movement brings remorse." If one feels remorse over this, and makes a start, good
fortune comes. [A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken. The distress is
drawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he is still influenced by the previous
conditions and fears that he may have cause for regret if he makes a move. But as soon
as he grasps the situation, changes his mental attitude, and makes a firm decision, he
masters oppression.]

Blofeld: Entangled with creepers and tottering uneasily, he voices regret for his actions.
Provided regret is felt, to advance will bring good fortune. [We shall certainly suffer, but
sincere regret will stand us in good stead.]

Liu: Oppressed by vines, he moves uneasily and says, "Movement brings regret." If he
feels regret, then sets forth -- good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Confined, tending-towards trailing creepers. Tending-towards the
unsteady [and] unsettled. Spoken-thus: stirring-up repenting possesses repenting.
Chastising significant.

Shaughnessy: Entangled in the creeping vines in the doubled rafters. Say "regretting the
level;" there is regret; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Exhausted at an impasse, in distress, is called regret over action; there is
regret. It is auspicious to go on an expedition.

Cleary (2): Exhausted in difficulty, in distress, thinking there will be regret if one acts,
one does regret. Going forth leads to good fortune. [At the extreme of Exhaustion, one
should go on actively. If one is negative, weak, and feeble in ability, one doubts whether
one’s ideas are right; this is like being tangled up and ill at ease. Fearing that if one acts
47 -- Oppression -- 47

one will regret it, one always shrinks back, regrettably. Therefore sages go directly forth
to good fortune, resolving this.]

Wu: He is surrounded by tangling vines and besieged with weariness. He says to himself:
“If I would be regretful for doing nothing or doing something, I might as well do
something to take my chances of getting out of hardship.”

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her spirit and action are unsuitable, but she repents of her former
errors and goes on to good fortune. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is not yet suitable. If there is
remorse, this is an auspicious change. Blofeld: The entangling creepers are indicated by
the unsuitable position of this line. Feeling regret is a means to obtain good fortune.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not yet appropriate indeed. Significance moving indeed. Cleary
(2): One has not hit the mark. There is regret because of regretting action; good fortune is
to go. Wu: He is not responsive. This would be a good move.

Legge: Line six is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its
height. She appears bound and on a perilous summit, but her extremity is also her
opportunity. She is moved to think of repenting, and if she does so and goes forward, all
will be fortunate.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man appears to be in the depths of distress. His fears and irresolute concerns
over previous failures are not conducive to progress. But the oppressive bonds can be
broken if he repents of his error and grasps the situation firmly.

Wing: Do not allow difficulties in the recent past to create in you attitudes about the
future. If you have become cynical or opinionated, you are lost. Improve your attitude, and
the situation will follow. Good fortune.

Editor: The dominant idea is that the subject of the sixth line ("at the top") is fettered
only by vegetation which presumably could be cast off with little trouble. (This might
suggest a long-standing dilemma or limiting belief: vines and creepers only entangle those
who are not active enough get out of their way.) It follows that only the illusion that they
can't be cast off prevents liberation.

Our common reaction to painful difficulty, consciously or unconsciously, is "what
have I done to deserve this?" "How can I get out of this?" "How can there be a God
if this is allowed to happen?" Rarely do we ask, "What new dimension of
experiencing does this try to teach me?" "Wherein am I being challenged?"

48 -- The Well -- 48
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FORTY-EIGHT –
THE WELL

Other titles: Welling, Potentialities Fulfilled, The Source, The Deep Psyche, "A
resurrection or transformation. Generations coming and going and the continuance of
life and development." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Although a town site may be altered, The Well remains the same. Its water level
neither disappears nor receives any great increase, and the people can draw from it freely.
Misfortune ensues if the rope breaks or the bucket is broken before it reaches the water.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Well. The town may be changed, but the well cannot be changed.
It neither decreases nor increases. They come and go and draw from the well. If one gets
down almost to the water and the rope does not go all the way, or the jug breaks, it brings
misfortune.

Blofeld: A Well. A city may be moved, but not a well. [The building of a city depends
upon ourselves; but wells cannot be moved to places where nature supplies no water.
The implication is that our activities are limited by natural conditions.] A well suffers
from no decrease and no increase; but often, when the people come to draw water there,
the rope is too short or the pitcher gets broken before reaching the water -- misfortune!
[What we desire is there for the taking, but we may not succeed in getting it.]

Liu: The Well. The city might be moved; but not the well. It neither overflows nor runs
dry. People come and go, drawing from the well. The rope nearly reaches the water, but
not quite; the jug breaks -- misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: amending the capital, not amending the Well. Without
losing, without acquiring. Going, coming: Welling, Welling. Muddy culmination: truly not-
yet the well- rope Well. Ruining one's pitcher: Pitfall. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of the life water coming from the depths that everyone may draw on.
It emphasizes that maintaining access to this central source is the adequate way to
handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to go to the well!]

Shaughnessy: The Well: Changing the city but not changing the well; there is no loss,
there is no gain. Going and coming so orderly; when the drying up arrives one also has not
yet drawn from the well; burdening its formed earthenware jug; inauspicious.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Cleary (1): The Well: Changing the village, not changing the well; no loss, no gain.
Those who come and go use the well as a well. If the rope does not reach all the way into
the well, of if the bucket breaks, that is unfortunate.

Cleary (2): ... People come and go, but the well remains a well. Lowering the bucket to
the water, if you overturn the bucket before drawing it up from the well, this is unlucky.

Wu: The Well indicates that the planning of a district may be changed, but the location
of the well may not. The water level of a well will neither increase nor decrease from use.
There are wells here and there. When one is drawing water from a well, if he tangles the
rope and damages the bucket just before it clears the well, it will be foreboding.

The Image

Legge: The image of water over wood forms The Well. The superior man comforts the
people and stimulates their mutual cooperation.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Water over wood: the image of The Well. Thus the superior man
encourages the people at their work and exhorts them to help one another.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes water over wood. The Superior Man encourages the
people with advice and assistance.

Liu: Water on wood symbolizes The Well. The superior man inspires people to work
diligently, and advises them to help each other.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above wood possessing stream. The Well. A chun tzu uses toiling
commoners to encourage mutualizing.

Cleary (1): There is water above wood – A Well. Thus do superior people comfort the
people and encourage reciprocity.

Wu: There is water above wood; this is The Well. Thus, the jun zi encourages people to
work for the good of the public and to help one another for a better life.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Wood penetrates the water and raises it, giving the image of The
Well which gives nourishment yet is not exhausted. The dynamic central lines in the
second and fifth places indicate that the town site may change, but the well does not. If
the rope does not reach the water the well does not serve its purpose. A broken bucket
brings about evil.

Legge: The upper trigram represents Water, and the lower symbolizes Wood, giving the
image of a wooden bucket in the water of a well. What is said on this hexagram might be
styled: "Lessons to be learned from a well for the proper government of a country." A well
is to its users what a government is to its subjects, and if rulers would only apply the
48 -- The Well -- 48

ancient precepts of government to the present circumstances, they and their people would
benefit greatly.

In the Judgment we see the well remaining substantially the same through many
changes of society -- a dependable source of refreshment to its users. As the fashion of the
well remains changeless, so do the principles of human nature and good government. The
value of the well depends upon the water being drawn up and used -- and so must the
principles of good government be implemented.

Anthony: This hexagram usually indicates that we have a hidden doubt or fear. We may
secretly disbelieve our path.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Amid the changes of life the only constant is the psyche itself -- to be alive is
to draw upon its energy. The ego’s challenge lies in the correct comprehension of its
images.

The Superior Man promotes the harmonious interplay of his thoughts and feelings.
(Works on the integration of his complexes.)

A well is a universal symbol of a source of inner truth, and is often associated with a
place that is sacred to the gods:

There he built an altar and invoked the name of Yahweh. There he pitched his tent,
and there Isaac's servants sank a well.
Genesis 26: 25

From the first well, which is of animal nature and deep, the father drinks, together
with his children and cattle; from the second, which is yet deeper and on the very
margin of nature, there drink only the children of men, namely those whose
reason has awakened and whom we call philosophers; from the third, the deepest
of all drink the sons of the All-Highest, whom we call gods and true theologians.
Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa

Psychologically interpreted, a well symbolizes the continuously flowing unconscious
psyche, the fountain of all awareness. In this hexagram each line represents a level within
the well -- by extension suggesting a hierarchy of value in the unconscious. It is important
to remember that not all of our inner images, intuitions or impulses come from the Self.
Note that lines one through four all show the water of the well not being utilized for one
reason or another -- only in lines three, five and six is it actually available for use.

In some sensitive individuals there is an awakening of para-psychological
perceptions. They have visions, which they believe to be of exalted beings; they
may hear voices, or begin to write automatically, accepting the messages at their
face value and obeying them unreservedly. The quality of such messages is very
varied. Sometimes they contain fine teachings, but they should always be

48 -- The Well -- 48

examined with much discrimination and sound judgment, and without being
influenced by their uncommon origin or by any claim by their alleged transmitter.
No validity should be attributed to messages containing definite orders and
commanding blind obedience, and to those tending to exalt the personality of the
recipient.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

The ego's point of view in relation to The Well is from the outside looking in – the
insights emerge from beneath the surface of awareness and can be held in the light of
consciousness only if one’s comprehension is able to contain them. If "the bucket breaks,"
our understanding is unequal to our observation and the insights are lost. (One might
plausibly find the image for a cancer cure within one's psyche, but without a conscious
frame of reference to acknowledge it, it would be unrecognized and lost.) Those who
closely monitor their dreams know that there is an endless outpouring of strange images
within the psyche which might be of inestimable value if only we knew what they referred
to.

Wilhelm emphasizes the idea of "nourishing the people," which psychologically
means that the role of the ego is to facilitate the cooperation of intra-psychic forces.

The solution lies, rather, along the lines of a harmonious integration of all drives
into the total personality, first through the proper subordination and
coordination, and then through the transformation and sublimation of the
excessive or unused quota of energy.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows a well so muddy that men will not drink of it; or an
old well to which neither birds nor other creatures resort.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One does not drink the mud of the well. No animals come to an old
well.

Blofeld: The muddy water at the well bottom is undrinkable; an old well attracts no
animals.

Liu: No one drinks from a muddy well. Even animals do not come to an old well. [A time
of obstacles.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: a bog, not taking-in. The ancient well without wildfowl.
[Wildfowl, CH’N: all wild and game birds; untamed.]

Shaughnessy: If the well is muddy do not drink; the old well does not have game.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Cleary (1): Mud in a well is not to be consumed. There are no animals at an abandoned
well.

Wu: The muddy water is not drinkable. The old well has nothing to offer.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: It has been forsaken in the course of time. Wilhelm/Baynes: Time
forsakes it. Blofeld: The first clause signifies that our affairs take a downward trend; the
second, that it is time to give up. Ritsema/Karcher: The below indeed. The season
stowed-away indeed. Cleary (2): It is below. Because its time is gone. Wu: It has been
abandoned.

Legge: Line one is magnetic and at the bottom of the figure - suggesting the mud at the
bottom of a well. Many men in authority are like such a well: corrupt, useless, unregarded.
It is said of line one: "Those who have a mind to do something in the world, when they
look at this line and its symbolism will learn how they ought to exert themselves."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man's life is immersed in corrupt, useless, and repulsive muck. No
one is attracted to him.

Wing: You rely too much upon your own opinions and perceptions and therefore have
little to offer others in the way of insight or nourishment. When there is no longer an
exchange with others, you are lost and forgotten.

Editor: The Legge and Ritsema/Karcher translations are the only ones which mention
"birds" or "wildfowl" here; the other translators use "animals," “game,” or "creatures." I
have often found the attribute of the bird to be useful in interpreting the psychological
intent of this line. Birds symbolize the realm of intellect, ideas or thought, and often this
line has clearly meant that my idea or concept of the matter at hand was stagnant or out-
moded. For example, the notion that the world is flat is an idea which was once widely
held, but which has since been "forsaken in the course of time." The image also suggests a
very primitive level within the psyche which is best shunned by consciousness.

In order to seize hold of the fantasies, I frequently imagined a steep descent. I
even made several attempts to get to the very bottom. The first time I reached, as
it were, a depth of about a thousand feet; the next time I found myself at the edge
of a cosmic abyss ... I had the feeling that I was in the land of the dead.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. Image of an archaic, stagnant level of awareness or point of view. Obsolete
thinking.

B. Avoid primitive or inferior elements within the situation.
48 -- The Well -- 48
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows a well from which by a hole the water escapes
and flows away to the shrimps and such small creatures among the grass, or one the water
of which leaks away from a broken bucket.

Wilhelm/Baynes: At the well-hole one shoots fishes. The jug is broken and leaks.

Blofeld: Perch dart from the water in the well hole; the pitcher is worn out and leaks.
[We are doubly unfortunate in that natural conditions (signified by fish in the water) and
our own ineptitude or misfortune combine to ensure our failure.]

Liu: The well is like a valley (it is collapsed). The fish can be seen. The jug is old and it
leaks. [One should be cautious now to avoid disaster.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: a gully, shooting bass. The jug cracked, leaking. [Bass,
FU: freshwater fish, said to go in pairs and be faithful.]

Shaughnessy: If the well is murky shoot the smelt; it is only the worn-out fish-trap.

Cleary (1): The depths of the well water a frog. The jar leaks. [While in the middle of self-
development, if one wants to develop others before one’s own development is sufficient,
one will be of no benefit to others, and will harm oneself first.]

Cleary (2): The depths of the well a minnow. The jar is broken and leaks. [This second
yang is intellectual Buddhahood, where one has been influenced somewhat by learning
but has not yet become a vessel of truth.]

Wu: The well is nearly dried up, with little water left for small fish. If one tries to draw
water from it, the bucket will be damaged. [Apparently the water table has changed,
which prevents water from flowing into the well. Trying to draw water from it not only
is unsuccessful, but also will damage the bucket. The little water may be enough for small
fish, but it is not enough for people.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He has none cooperating with him above. Wilhelm/Baynes: He
has no one to do it with him. Blofeld: This is indicated by the failure of this line to win
response from the other lines. Ritsema/Karcher: Without associating indeed. Cleary
(2): It has no partner. Wu: It has nothing to offer.

Legge: Line two is dynamic, and might very well symbolize an active spring which feeds
the well, and through it, the ground and its cultivators. But it is in an inappropriate place,
and has no proper correlate. Its cool waters cannot be brought to the top.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Wilhelm/Baynes: The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well is a
place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only to catch fish. But the
jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept in it. This describes the situation of a person
who possesses good qualities but neglects them. No one bothers about him. As a result he
deteriorates in mind. He associates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish
anything worthwhile.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: As in the case of able statesmen who refuse to serve as ministers of the government,
the man possesses precious qualities but neglects them. His talents are dissipated in
miscellaneous directions.

Wing: Because you may not be using your abilities and talents in a worthwhile way, you
may go unnoticed in the world. When you are not sought out and challenged by your
contemporaries, your talents will dissipate. When it becomes most important, you cannot
fulfill your function.

Anthony: Doubt that we can achieve our goal through following the path causes good
nourishment to be useless.

Editor: This line reiterates the ideas presented in the Judgment: "If the drawing has
nearly been accomplished, but before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is
broken, this is evil." Psychologically, the image can suggest an insight or idea which is lost
because it is not comprehended.

In the training analysis the doctor must learn to know his own psyche and to take
it seriously. If he cannot do that, the patient will not learn either. He will lose a
portion of his psyche, just as the doctor has lost that portion of his psyche which he
has not learned to understand.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. For some reason you are unable to retain something or make a connection.

B. Wasted energy, lost power.

C. An asset now in decline.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows a well which has been cleared out, but is not used.
Our hearts are sorry for this, for the water might be drawn out and used. If the king were
only intelligent, both he and we might receive the benefit of it.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Wilhelm/Baynes: The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it. This is my heart's
sorrow, for one might draw from it. If the king were clear-minded, good fortune might be
enjoyed in common.

Blofeld: The well has been cleaned out; to my heart's sorrow, no one drinks from it,
though it could well be used to supply drinking water. [If we fail now, it is not for lack of
opportunity but because we do not make use of opportunity.] The King is wise and it is
possible for the people to share his good fortune.

Liu: The well has been cleared, but still no one drinks from it. This is sorrowful for me
(the well), for others might draw from it. If the king is enlightened, he will use it for the
benefit of all.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: oozing, not taking-in. Activating my heart aching.
Permitting availing-of drawing water: Kingly brightness. Together-with acquiescing-in
one's blessing.

Shaughnessy: If the well is seeping do not drink; it makes my heart blocked; it can be
used to draw water; the king's brightness together receives its blessing.

Cleary (1): The well is cleared, but not drunk from; this is the concern of one’s heart. It is
worth drawing from. When the ruler is enlightened, all receive the blessing. [This line
refers to one whose self-development is fulfilled.]

Wu: The well water is clean, but it is not used for drinking. It is a pity. If it were drawn for
drinking, as it should be, then we all would benefit from it like people enjoying the reign of
a perspicacious king.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Even passersby would be sorry that the well isn't used. A prayer is
made that the king were intelligent, for then blessing would be received. Wilhelm/
Baynes: This is the sorrow of the active people. They beg that the king may be clear-
minded, in order to attain good fortune. Blofeld: The first sentence implies activities
which call forth pity; the second, that we should accept our good fortune. Ritsema/
Karcher: Moving: aching indeed. Seeking kingly brightness: acquiescing-in blessing
indeed. Cleary (2): When the well is cleared but not drunk from, travelers are concerned;
they seek enlightenment in the king to receive blessings. [Because it subdues the basic
afflictions of the mind, the well is cleared, but because it does not yet realize essence, it is
not drunk from. Here one should seek the aid of the buddhas; then one can help oneself
and help others.] Wu: The people pray that the king may be perspicacious, such that they
may all benefit from his reign.

Legge: Line three is dynamic and in its proper place -- it represents an able minister or
officer.
48 -- The Well -- 48
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man has competence which is being overlooked and unused. Were the chief
executive clear-sighted, such a man would have been employed for the benefit of all. Those
who know his abilities are deeply saddened to see them go to waste.

Wing: You may be overlooking an opportunity that has come your way or you, and your
talents, may be overlooked by others. This is very unfortunate. If somehow this could be
recognized, you and everyone around you would benefit.

Anthony: In spite of understanding things correctly, we cling to traditional defenses. The
king, our inner self, is not clear-minded enough to trust and draw upon rich inner
resources: to ask for help, to trust the unknown, to persevere in allowing ourself to be led
docilely and receptively. Our path is trustworthy.

Editor: Legge is unusually terse here. Since this is the only line in the lower trigram that
is correctly positioned above its two incorrect companions, it suggests an asset which is
ignored to the disadvantage of potential users. Perhaps an insight or connection within the
psyche is going unrecognized by conscious awareness. The Well is very hierarchal in the
progression of its lines, and it is instructive to compare it with hexagram number fifty,
The Sacrificial Vessel, the third line of which has a similar meaning to this one.

Here we confront a puzzling space-time transcendent dimension of a quasi-
absolute knowledge from within, which is not, however, directly accessible to the
rational ego. In dreams the unconscious dimension operates as if it encompassed
unknown events outside of space and time (and to the dreamer often enough
unknowable) and also subjective problems which lie ahead in the dreamer's
development.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. An asset is ignored -- to the stress of those who might benefit from it.

B. Unused power is wasted power.

C. You don’t see an advantage available to you.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows a well, the lining of which is well laid. There will
be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The well is being lined. No blame.

Blofeld: The well is being tiled -- no error!

Liu: The well is being rebuilt. No blame.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: lining, without fault.

Shaughnessy: The well is walled; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): The well is tiled, without fault.

Cleary (2): When the well is tiled, there is no fault.

Wu: There is no error in repairing the well.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The well has been put in good repair. Wilhelm/Baynes: The well is
being put in working order. Blofeld: For it is under repair. [We are likely to suffer a
necessary delay, but the situation is hopeful.] Ritsema/Karcher: Adjusting the well
indeed. Cleary (2): This means fixing the well. Wu: Because it is functioning.

Legge: Line four is magnetic, but in its proper place. She is neither to be condemned nor
praised. She takes care of herself, but does nothing for others. The cultivation of one's self,
which is represented here, is fundamental to the government of others.

Wilhelm/Baynes: ...In life also there are times when a man must put himself in order.
During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonetheless valuable,
because by enhancing his powers and abilities through inner development, he can
accomplish all the more later on.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man begins to organize his life and develop his capacities. He is too occupied in
this task to help others at the moment. For this he deserves no blame, since he will be able
to contribute more later on.

Wing: The time has come to pull back and reorganize your life or re-evaluate your goals.
This means that you will not be taking an active part in the affairs of others. By putting
your life in order, however, you will be able to contribute more fully later on.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all translate this line in terms of an incomplete process:
the well is undergoing reconstruction. It isn't "well laid" it is "being well laid." That is, the
well is undergoing repairs now and cannot be used until the repairs are completed.
Psychologically, an inner transformation is taking place.

While the hidden life forces are performing their mysterious work of
transformation, the rational and willed attitude of the conscious ego can only
interfere. It can neither assist nor guide. The libido is withdrawn from it, and it is
left high and dry. When this happens one can do nothing but await the re-

48 -- The Well -- 48

emergence of the psychic energy, alert to profit by the creative work in which it
has been taking part.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. While inner forces are being transformed they are unavailable for conscious use.

B. The image suggests the idea of "putting one's house in order." Something is
being transformed.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows a clear, limpid well, the waters from whose cold
spring are freely drunk.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In the well there is a clear, cold spring from which one can drink.

Blofeld: The well is cool; its water tastes like water from an icy spring. [All goes well
with us.]

Liu: The water of the well is clear and cool. People drink from it. [People will succeed in
their undertakings and profit from them.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: limpid, cold spring water taken-in.

Shaughnessy: If the well is crisscrossed with cold springs, drink.

Cleary (1): The well is pure, the cold spring is used for drinking.

Cleary (2): The cold spring in the well is drunk from.

Wu: The well water is fresh and clean. It is like drinking from a cool spring.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is indicated by the central and correct position of the line.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Drinking from the clear, cold spring depends on its central and
correct position. Blofeld: This is indicated by the suitable position of the line, which is
central to the upper trigram. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering correcting indeed. Cleary
(2): Balance and correctness. Wu: Central and correct.

Legge: Line five is dynamic and in his correct place -- the seat of the ruler. As a well full
of clear water is accessible to its users, so should a ruler be to his subjects.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man who
has virtues like a well of this sort is to be a leader and savior of men, for he has the water of
life. Nevertheless, the character for “good fortune” is left out here. The all-important thing
48 -- The Well -- 48

about a well is that its water be drawn. The best water is only a potentiality for
refreshment as long as it is not brought up. So too with leaders of mankind: it is all-
important that one should drink from the spring of their words and translate them into life.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The natural-born leader performs wide and useful services for the people.

Wing: You possess all the potential possible for insight and wisdom. This gift is the mark
of an unparalleled leader. Such abilities and insights, however, must be applied to your
daily life in order to continue growing and developing.

Anthony: It is not enough to have the water of the well; to be of use we must drink it. If
we have doubts about our path, it cannot work for us. We can only make knowledge ours
by putting it to experience, and accepting the hazard of depending on it.

Editor: When our conscious attitude is open to inner truth, that truth is reflected in the
world. The image suggests that an outer attitude reflects an inner reality. See line six for
the subtle difference between the two images.

For when the surface of those waters is disturbed by no slightest ripple of thought,
Then shall the glory of my Self, Which is thy true Self, Be mirrored unto thee.
P.F. Case -- The Book of Tokens

A. Integrated energy is at the surface of awareness.

B. You have what you need to succeed.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the water from the well brought to the top, which
is not allowed to be covered. This suggests the idea of sincerity. There will be great good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: One draws from the well without hindrance. It is dependable.
Supreme good fortune.

Blofeld: The well-rope lies unconcealed -- confidence and supreme good fortune!

Liu: The well is clean, without a cover. There is confidence that water can be drawn.
Great good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Well: collecting, no cover. Possessing conformity, Spring
significant.
48 -- The Well -- 48

Shaughnessy: If the well is arrested, do not cover it; there is a return; prime
auspiciousness.

Cleary (1): The well is being drawn from; don’t cover it. Great fortune.

Cleary (2): Do not cover the well enclosure. There is nurturance, which is very fortunate.

Wu: The water is being drawn and the well is left uncovered. With confidence in its
inexhaustible supply, people will have great fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This indicates the grand accomplishment of the idea of the hexagram.
Wilhelm/Baynes: In the top place, this means great perfection. Blofeld: The supreme
good fortune presaged here is in the nature of a great achievement. Ritsema/Karcher:
Spring significant located-in the above. The great accomplishing indeed. Cleary (2):
Great fortune at the top is great fulfillment. Wu: Great accomplishments.

Legge: The sixth line is in its proper place, but magnetic. If the general idea of the
figure was different, a bad auspice might be drawn from it. But the water is drawn
up and the well is left uncovered so that it may be used by everyone. "Sincerity" suggests
that the supply is inexhaustible.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man's inexhaustible and dependable inspiration is drawn upon by all with whom
he comes in contact.

Wing: You can now share with others good, dependable advice and exceptional
fulfillment. There will be supreme good fortune in your life.

Editor: The difference in meaning between lines five and six is a maddeningly subtle one.
While five suggests that our conscious attitude reflects an inner state, line six suggests that
inner and outer have become one -- the difference is between the reflection of an object
and the object itself. Compare lines five and six in hexagram number twenty,
Contemplation, for a similar subtlety of difference. In general the import is that
everything you need to comprehend the matter at hand is available for your use.

In so far as every individual has the law of his life inborn in him it is theoretically
possible for any man to follow this law and so become a personality, that is, to
achieve wholeness.
Jung -- The Development of Personality

A. Truth flows freely.

B. All the data are in -- now it's up to you to take advantage of it.

METAMORPHOSIS

Judgment

Legge: Metamorphosis is believed in only after it has been accomplished.
Firm correctness abolishes regret and brings successful progress.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Revolution. On your own day you are believed. Supreme
success, furthering through perseverance. Remorse disappears.

Blofeld: Revolution. Not before the day of its completion will men have faith
in it -- sublime success! Determination in a righteous course brings reward;
regret vanishes! [Very often, this means renovation, as of character, etc. But it
may also mean exactly what it says; Confucius, though he regarded loyalty to
the ruler as one of the highest virtues, recognized that evil men forfeit their right
to rule by their excesses, and it is probable that this notion antedates him by
many centuries.]

Liu: Revolution. When the appropriate day comes, the people will believe in
it. Great success. It is beneficial to continue. Remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Skinning; before-zenith sun, thereupon conforming.
Spring Growing Harvesting Trial. Repenting extinguished. [This hexagram
describes your situation in terms of stripping away a protective cover. It
emphasizes that radically changing and renewing the way you present yourself
is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: The Bridle: on the si day then return; prime receipt; beneficial
to determine; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): In revolution, the sun of the self is truth: This is creative,
developmental, fruitful, and perfect. Regret vanishes. [In old texts when it says
that the alchemical elixir is in people, but first they have to refine the self and
wait for the proper time, this means to make a radical purge of all the pollution
of past influences and not let any flaws remain in the heart.]
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Cleary (2): Change is believed in on the day it is completed. It is very
successful, beneficial if correct. Regret vanishes.

Wu: Reform indicates that revolution will become credible when the time is
ripe. In this way, it is great and pervasive and advantageous to be persevering.
Regret will disappear.

The Image

Legge: A fire in the marsh -- the image of Metamorphosis. The superior man
synchronizes his astronomical calculations to clarify the times and seasons.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fire in the lake: the image of Revolution. Thus the
superior man sets the calendar in order and makes the seasons clear.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire rising from a marshy lake. The Superior
Man regulates the calendar and thus ensures that men are clear about times and
seasons.

Liu: Within the lake, fire -- this symbolizes Revolution. The superior man
makes a calendar, clearly arranging the seasons.

Ritsema/Karcher: Marsh center possessing fire. Skinning. A chun tzu uses
regulating time-reckoning to brighten the seasons.

Cleary (1): There is fire in a lake, changing. Thus do superior people make a
calendar and clarify the seasons.

Cleary (2): Fire in a lake – changing. Leaders make calendars to define the
seasons.

Wu: There is fire below the marsh; this is Reform. Thus, the jun zi is
inspired to develop a calendrical system for keeping time.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Metamorphosis, Water and Fire extinguish each other.
When two daughters with opposing viewpoints live together, change is inevitable;
but after the change is accomplished, faith is accorded to it: Clarity brings good
cheer and progress through what is correct. When a transformation is properly
accomplished, all occasion for regret disappears. Heaven and earth undergo their
changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. The rulers of old
transformed the state in accordance with the will of heaven and in response to
the wishes of men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change.

Legge: The written character translated as Metamorphosis is used here in the
sense of changing. Originally used for the skin of an animal or bird, it received
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

the significance of changing at a very early time. The figure deals with the subject
of changes which are called for in the state of the country. The necessity for
change is recognized, and hints are given as to the spirit and manner in which
they should be brought about.

The Judgment assumes that change is viewed by people generally with
suspicion and dislike, and therefore should not be made hastily. [This can refer
to inner complexes, habits, etc. – Ed.] When the necessity for change has been
proven beforehand and subsequently carried out with firm correctness, then the
issue will turn out satisfactorily.

The lower trigram is the symbol for Fire and the upper for Water. Water
extinguishes fire, and fire dries up water. Each "changes" the other. The lower
trigram is also the second daughter and the upper is the youngest daughter. In
the scheme of the trigrams these two are seen to be mutually incompatible.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Hidden within its cocoon the caterpillar becomes a butterfly -- who
would believe it until the Metamorphosis was complete?

The Superior Man recognizes that celestial sequences create changes only
when they are due; he therefore acts in accordance with the requirements of the
times.

The forty-ninth hexagram makes an analogy between the natural
Metamorphosis of animal pelts and the proper way to regard radical changes
in government. Lines one, five and six all refer to skin, and two, three and four
refer to politics. The general idea is that radical transformations occur at their
own natural pace -- they cannot be successfully forced any more than eggs can be
made to hatch before their time. The Image makes this point in its reference to
the celestial correlation of the seasons.

There is a time for everything,
A time for every occupation under heaven:
A time for giving birth,
A time for dying;
A time for planting,
A time for uprooting what has been planted (etc)...
Ecclesiastes 3: 1-2

Once one assumes conscious responsibility for the Work, there comes a
long and indefinite period in which one labors unceasingly without any visible
results at all. Dream images and I Ching meditations will indicate that progress
is being made, but the ego's life in spacetime consists of seemingly fruitless labor
in the service of a transcendental ideal. This is a universal experience -- it
happens to everyone who undertakes the Work. In the Western Mystery
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Tradition it is known as the Dark Night of the Soul. (See Hexagram Number-36
for further insights into this unavoidable phenomenon.)

The Personality undergoes a willful "death,” surrendering everything
that it believes itself to be. Most difficult is that this total surrender of life,
this initiatory sacrifice, must precede the experience of cosmic
awareness. One is required to give up the totality of one's being, one's
very life, in relative darkness, yet in the faith that there will be a
resurrection into the Light.
R. Wang -- The Qabalistic Tarot

Psychologically interpreted, Metamorphosis means that changes are
taking place in the unconscious psyche, but don't expect them to manifest until
their growth is complete. The ego must recognize this and persevere with the
Work, even when "common sense" counsels otherwise. It is a period of probation
and trial, and many there are who fail the test.

There is no short cut without impeding growth or setting the flow pattern
of the Soul back, until each physical or psychological function has been
correctly connected or developed ... Many aspirants do not perceive this
law and become impatient and even lose faith when Providence seems to
be holding back. Nothing occurs outside its time as it is part of a
sequence in the great cosmic cycle that unfolds the Grand Design of
Existence.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah and Exodus

If there is any consolation in this terrible ordeal, it is that others have
made the journey before you, and survived. Keep the faith that, in the imagery of
this hexagram, the lower trigram of Clear Perception following the upper trigram
of Cheerfulness will lead you through the most challenging of all transformations.

Where the issue of ultimate meaning is constellated, transformation will
eventually occur, even though only by way of a great deal of suffering.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject as if he were bound with the
skin of a yellow ox.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.

Blofeld: For strength, use yellow oxhide.

Liu: To strengthen it, use yellow oxhide.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Ritsema/Karcher: Thonging avails-of yellow cattle's skin.

Shaughnessy: Together use the yellow ox's bridle.

Cleary (1): Wrapped up in yellow ox-hide.

Cleary (2): Use yellow ox hide for wrapping.

Wu: He appears as if with a yellow cow’s hide.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He should in his circumstances be taking action. (Sic.)
Wilhelm/Baynes: One should not act thus. Blofeld: Such aids to strength are
necessary, for this line cannot suit itself to its position. [We cannot adapt
ourselves to the present situation; we must increase our strength so as to be able
to combat it.] Ritsema/Karcher: Not permitted to use possessing activating
indeed. Cleary (2): It will not do to use contrivance. Wu: Because he is not
ready for any task.

Legge: Line one at the bottom of the figure may be taken as denoting change
made at too early a period. He has no proper correlate or helper above, hence he
is represented as tied up and unable to take any action.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is under restraint. Premature offensive action will be
unfortunate.

Wing: Restrain yourself. You don't really know if it is an appropriate time to act.
Wait until you're sure. A little moderation will do a world of good now, whereas
premature action will bring difficulties.

Editor: There is a proofreading error in the Confucian commentary on this line
which is preserved in both the Dover and Mentor editions of Legge's translation.
The comment should read: "He should ... not be taking action." The idea of the
hexagram is molting, but at the beginning one is still wrapped in the protective
skin of one's chrysalis. Try to remove a butterfly from its cocoon and you will
surely kill it. The growth cycle must complete itself fully before the revolution
can take place or the new order prevail. Sometimes the line can suggest the idea
of being hidebound -- stuck in a mental cocoon of limiting beliefs. (Yellow is the
color of clarity, intellect.) Hidebound: "Having an inflexible or
ultraconservative character: bigoted, narrow." As always, the exact
interpretation depends upon your intuition about the situation at hand.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

No one except perhaps the wisest can perceive what lies within him, what
is present at that point in a negative form, ready to manifest tomorrow
or a million years from now.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- An Introduction to the Cabala

A. The situation is still developing. The time is not right for action.

B. Hidebound thinking prevents lucid action.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject making her changes after
some time has passed. Action taken will be fortunate. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When one's own day comes, one may create revolution.
Starting brings good fortune. No blame.

Blofeld: On the day revolution is completed, to advance brings good fortune
and is free from error. [We must not advance further until certain major
changes have been completed.]

Liu: When the right day for revolution arrives, start. Good fortune. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Before-zenith sun, thereupon Skinning it. Chastising
significant, without fault.

Shaughnessy: On the si day then bridle it; to be upright is auspicious; there is
no trouble.

Cleary (1): The sun of the self is the good fortune of expedition in revolution; no
blame. [Emptying the mind and governing oneself, one understands revolution
and can first get rid of personal desires... This is the revolution of emptying the
mind to seek illumination.]

Cleary (2): On the day of completion, the change has taken place. An expedition
leads to good fortune, without blame.

Wu: When the time is ripe, reform is in order. It will be auspicious to go
forward with the plan. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She makes her changes when some time has passed -- what
she does will be a matter of admiration. Wilhelm/Baynes: Action brings
splendid success. Blofeld: This line presages great blessings. [Unexpected good
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

fortune.] Ritsema/Karcher: Moving possessing excellence indeed. Cleary
(2): There is felicity in going. Wu: The action will be praiseworthy.

Legge: Line two is magnetic in her correct and central place in the center of the
trigram of Clarity. Her proper correlate is the dynamic fifth line ruler. Let her
take action in the way of change.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: After a series of unsuccessful attempts, the man's chance to make effective
changes has come. He succeeds because of the requisite capabilities, thorough
planning, and public confidence.

Wing: You have reached a point where change is both necessary and timely. To
bring this about requires a strong vision of the ultimate outcome and a thorough
commitment to your project, but with the correct inner attitude, you will meet
with success. You will now find additional support in others.

Editor: This line is conditional and subject to misunderstanding if taken as an
injunction for immediate action. Legge’s commentary and the Siu and Wing
paraphrases misinterpret the timing covertly explicit here: the core idea is to
prepare yourself now for a later change, not to take action now. This
echoes the promise in Wilhelm's Judgment: "On your own day you are
believed." Blofeld adds a prescient footnote to his translation: "We must not
advance further until certain major changes have been completed.” Because the
Work demands almost superhuman levels of restraint, one often receives this line
as a kind of promise: "When the Work is completed you may begin to be active
again in the world."

Kabbalah is an undramatic tradition that requires great patience and
stability. One of the reasons for this tempo is that everyone has to
mature his potential gradually and thoroughly at his natural pace. In
this way his life's work unfolds at the right moment in his own and the
cosmos's time.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- Kabbalah

A. Prepare the groundwork for the changes you anticipate. Change will
come when you're ready for it.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows that action taken by its subject will be
evil. Though he be firm and correct, his position is perilous. If the changes he
contemplates have been three times fully discussed, he will be believed.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Wilhelm/Baynes: Starting brings misfortune. Perseverance brings danger.
When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times, one may commit
himself, and men will believe him.

Blofeld: To advance now would bring misfortune and persistence would lead to
further troubles. When talk of revolution has thrice arisen, then act with
confidence. [We must make very sure that a rumored change will occur before
we take further action.]

Liu: To advance leads to misfortune. To continue leads to danger. When the idea
of revolution has been spoken publicly three times, the people will believe it.

Ritsema/Karcher: Chastising: pitfall, Trial: adversity. Skinning words three-
times drawing-near: possessing conformity.

Shaughnessy: To be upright is inauspicious; determination is dangerous. When
bridling words thrice approach, there is a return.

Cleary (1): It is not auspicious to go on an expedition; even if correct, there is
danger. Revolutionizing words formulated thrice, there is certainty.

Cleary (2): An expedition leads to misfortune, dangerous even if correct.
Change, then speak; on the third presentation, there will be trust. [Here one is
too adamant and unbalanced; but one is in correspondence with the top
(magnetic line), which is flexible but upright, representing a leader that is like a
spotted leopard and cannot be changed forcibly... One can only change oneself
so as to go along with the leader.]

Wu: Going forward is foreboding. Remaining firm is perilous. In discussing
reform thoroughly, he will gain confidence. [“Remaining firm is perilous”
because by doing simply nothing, he will miss an opportunity in making
contributions to reformation. In “discussing reform thoroughly” with others,
such as his [6th line] correlate, he will gain confidence in doing the right thing.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The change contemplated has been three times fully
discussed -- to what else should attention be directed? Wilhelm/Baynes:
"When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times, one may commit
himself." If not, how far are things to be allowed to go? Blofeld: What else
could we do under the circumstances? Ritsema/Karcher: Furthermore
actually wherefore having-them. Cleary (2): Make three presentations. Where
are you going? Wu: What else can be done?

Legge: The symbolism of line three is twofold. The line is dynamic and in his
correct position, but has passed the center of the lower trigram of Clarity and is
on an outward verge. These conditions may dispose him to reckless and violent
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

changes which would be bad. But if he acts with caution and due deliberation he
may take action, and he will be believed in.

Anthony: Changes are difficult to make. If we expect too much progress too
soon, we are being hasty; if we do not put forth energy to persevere because the
task seems too difficult, this is being excessively conservative. We need strength
to make changes; strength comes only from seeing clearly that we must make this
effort.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is disposed toward violent and far-reaching changes. Yet after the
complaints have been well aired, his recommendations will be understood. He
will succeed.

Wing: Do not step into change hastily, for this will bring misfortune. Yet if you
hesitate or deny the possibility of change you will put yourself in danger. Rely
upon openness and self-control to guide you. When the necessity of Changing
has made itself perfectly clear, and when you have thoroughly contemplated its
effect, you may then proceed.

Editor: This depicts a situation in which one must find the proper balance
between action and inaction. The line is an unambiguous warning about being
clear in one's mind and cautious in one's transactions. Balanced differentiations
(perhaps augmented by mature advice from others) are called for. A rather callow
impatience is implied, so it is useful to note the third place in Hexagram 17
(Following) which is created if this is the only changing line: “By staying with
the strong man, you lose the boy. Through following, one will gain what one
seeks. To continue benefits” (Liu). This is an unambiguous picture of immaturity
(inexperience) rectified via seasoned discernment – psychologically, an image of
the ego “following” the intentions of the Self.

Perfect sincerity leads to activity. Activity leads to change. And change
leads to transformation. Hence it is said, "One will consider before he
speaks and deliberate before he acts. By such consideration and
deliberations he undertakes to complete all changes and
transformations."
Chou Tun-I

A. Suggests a situation which can best be resolved via careful
discrimination and judicious choices of action. If appropriate, seek experienced
counsel.

B. Cool it! Premature or ill-considered action brings defeat.

49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows occasion for repentance disappearing
from its subject. Let him be believed in, and though he changes the existing
ordinances, there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse disappears. Men believe him. Changing the form
of government brings good fortune.

Blofeld: Regret vanishes and confidence is established. A change of government
brings good fortune. [Taken out of its political context, this may presage a great
change in some other walk of life.]

Liu: Remorse vanishes. People believe him. Changing the government brings
good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished, possessing conformity. Amending
fate significant.

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone; there is a return that changes the mandate;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Regret vanishes. With sincerity one changes destiny for the better.
[If one is sincere in reforming oneself, while strong one can be yielding, and can
transmute the temperament and not be constrained by yin and yang. This is the
revolution of employing strength with flexibility.]

Cleary (2): Regret vanishes; there is trust. Changing one’s fate, there is good
fortune.

Wu: Regret disappears. Confidence abounds. Revolution will be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune of changing the ordinances is due to the
faith reposed in his aims. Wilhelm/Baynes: Is due to the fact that one's
conviction meets with belief. Blofeld: Good fortune in the sense that people will
put their faith in our objectives. Ritsema/Karcher: Trustworthy purpose
indeed. Cleary (2): Belief in the aim. Wu: Comes from the people’s trust in its
purposes.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but in the place of a magnetic line. This might
vitiate any change he makes, but other conditions suggest a contrary effect: the
line has passed from the lower trigram into the upper where water and fire come
into contact. [e.g., Fire boils water, producing steam to do work. Ed.] In
addition, the fourth place is that of the minister immediately below the ruler's
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

seat. These considerations all demand action in harmony with the idea of
change. Therefore, if he has secured the general confidence he can proceed with
the greatest of changes -- even to change the dynasty -- with good results.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES
Siu: The man succeeds in effecting changes because of inner firmness,
adherence to higher ideals, coupled with adequate power.

Wing: A radical change is at hand. If your position is correct, your motives
worthwhile and you are properly prepared, the new situation will bring great
good fortune.

Editor: I have seldom received this line except in the conditional sense: "When
the proper conditions of the situation are met, then one may act."
Psychologically, when the inner complexes are finally convinced that you mean
business they will cooperate and fall into line. To "change the existing
ordinances" is to change your beliefs or attitudes. Ritsema/Karcher define
"possessing conformity" as: "inner and outer are in accord; confidence of the
spirits has been captured." They translate "amend" (i.e. "amending fate") as
"fighting your own errors." This reflects Anthony’s observation: “Capricious
demands from our inferiors...will have a bad effect.” (In Anthony’s paradigm,
“our inferiors” relate to our habits, complexes, etc.) If this is the only changing
line, the new hexagram created is number 63, Completion, suggesting that a
major synthesis may be at hand if you’re careful.

Such a solution will not appear in the form of an intellectual conclusion
or thought-out plan, but will arise in dream or phantasy in the form of
an image or symbol, so unexpected and yet so apt that its appearance
will seem like a miracle. Such a symbol has the effect of breaking the
deadlock. It has power to bring the opposing demands of the psyche
together in a newly created form through which the life energies can
flow in a new creative effort.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Things will change when your actions reflect your intent. When
confidence is established one may proceed with one's plans.

B. A major transformation is possible now.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the great man producing his changes
as the tiger does when he changes his stripes. Before he divines and proceeds to
action, faith has been reposed in him.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Wilhelm/Baynes: The great man changes like a tiger. Even before he
questions the oracle he is believed.

Blofeld: The great man accomplishes the change like a tiger; he is so confident
that he does not need to employ divination. ["Like a tiger" and "like a leopard"
do not have any connotation of fierceness. The striped skin of the former and the
spotted hide of the latter symbolize brilliance and beauty respectively.]

Liu: The great man transforms himself like a tiger. Even before prediction by the
oracle, people will believe him.

Ritsema/Karcher: Great People; tiger transforming. Not-yet an augury,
possessing conformity.

Shaughnessy: The great man's tiger whip; not yet having prognosticated, there
is a return.

Cleary (1): A great person changes like a tiger. There is certainty without
divination.

Cleary (2): Great people change like tigers. There is certainty without
augury.

Wu: The great man makes changes like a tiger. He is confident of success even
without divination.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The beauty of the tiger's stripes becomes more brilliant.
Wilhelm/Baynes: His marking is distinct. Blofeld: His accomplishing the
change `like a tiger' means in a brilliantly civilized manner. Ritsema/ Karcher:
One's pattern luminous indeed. Cleary (2): Their stripes are clear. Wu: His
refinements are illustrious.

Legge: Line five has every quality proper to the lord of the hexagram, and his
action will be in every way beneficial. He is symbolized by the tiger. The changes
he makes are symbolized by the bright stripes of the tiger when it has just molted
its coat.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The great man clearly shows the strong guiding principles behind his
proposed changes. He retains the spontaneous support of the followers.

Wing: If you look around, you will find that your actions are spontaneously
supported by others. You are in the correct position to bring great change to the
situation. Trust your intuition in the matter.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Editor: Wilhelm renders the second sentence of the line as: "Even before he
questions the oracle he is believed." Blofeld translates it as: "He is so confident
that he does not need to employ divination." The image suggests a powerful,
distinct and clear-cut transformation -- a situation so glaringly obvious that there
is no room for doubt. If this is the only changing line, the new hexagram created
is number 55, Expansion of Awareness, the Judgment of which states:
"...When the king is enlightened there is no need to fear a change. Let him be as
the sun at noon." (Legge). Or, "...The king attains abundance. Be not sad. Be like
the sun at midday." (Wilhelm). In some situations the line can be interpreted as
an admonition from the oracle that you are asking questions which you can figure
out for yourself.

The lips of the king utter oracles,
He does not err when he speaks in judgment.
Proverbs 16: 10

A. A powerful confirmation or endorsement.

B. The situation is too obvious to require divination.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the superior man producing his changes
as the leopard does when he changes his spots, while inferior men change their
faces and show obedience. To go forward now would lead to evil, but there will
be good fortune in abiding firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The superior man changes like a panther. The inferior man
molts in the face. Starting brings misfortune. To remain persevering brings good
fortune.

Blofeld: The Superior Man brings about the change like a leopard and lesser
men promptly switch their allegiance. ["Like a tiger" and "like a leopard" do not
have any connotation of fierceness. The striped skin of the former and the
spotted hide of the latter symbolize brilliance and beauty respectively.] To
advance now brings misfortune. Righteous persistence brings good fortune to
those who remain where they are.

Liu: The superior man transforms himself like a leopard. The inferior man
changes his attitude. To advance leads to misfortune. To remain and persist leads
to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: A chun tzu: leopard transforming. Small People: Skinning
the visage. Chastising: pitfall. Residing-in Trial significant.
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

Shaughnessy: The gentleman's leopard whip; the little man bridles the face; to
be upright is inauspicious; determination about dwelling is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Superior people transform, inferior people change on the surface. To
go on an expedition is unlucky, to remain correct is auspicious. [Gentle non-
striving revolution is only possible to superior people with faith. Inferior people
without faith cannot accomplish it. Inferior people change their appearance,
their surface, but they do not change their hearts; their wills are not firm, and
they do not finish what they have started, eventually to fall into ruin, bringing
on misfortune. Superior people always remain correct; their will becomes
stronger with time, so that they ultimately attain the Tao and achieve good
fortune. This is revolution in which false and true bear their fruits.]

Cleary (2): Developed people transform like leopards; undeveloped people
change their faces ... etc.

Wu: The jun zi makes changes like a leopard. The little man makes only
cosmetic changes. Going forward is foreboding. Remaining firm is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The superior man produces his changes as the leopard does
when he changes his spots means that their beauty becomes more elegant.
Inferior men change their faces means that they show themselves prepared to
follow their ruler. Wilhelm/Baynes: His marking is more delicate ... He is
devoted and obeys the prince. Blofeld: The Superior Man brings about the
change `like a leopard' means that he does so in a manner that is exceedingly
graceful. That lesser men promptly switch their allegiance means that they
readily accept his lead. Ritsema/Karcher: One's pattern beautiful indeed.
Yielding uses adhering-to the chief indeed. Cleary (2): Their spots are dense.
They follow the leader docilely. Wu: Because his refinements are elegant. This
means he (the little man) will obey the king.

Legge: Line six is magnetic, but still penetrated with the spirit of the hexagram.
He is a superior man, inferior only to the great man immediately below him in
line five. Any changes he makes will be subordinate only to those of the ruler. If
he be an inferior man, he will be compliant and submissive. The lesson for him is
to abide firm and correct without taking unilateral action.

Anthony: The inferiors conform to the required changes only superficially.
Habit is strong and clarity short-lived. Permanent change occurs only through
step by step discipline. Giant steps lead to rebellion and back-sliding, therefore
patience and perseverance are necessary.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: After bringing about successful major reforms, the man introduces the
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

necessary minor adjustments in order to bring inferior men into compliance with
the new order.

Wing: The major objective is reached and only details remain to be adjusted.
Although you may see limitations in the new condition, you must not create
disharmony by reaching for perfection. Try to find satisfaction in what is possible
now and bring stability into your life.

Editor: This line does not lend itself to the gender symbolism for a magnetic
line. The difference between the changes in line five and those in line six is seen
in the difference between a tiger's stripes and a leopard's spots, and in the relative
rank and value of the two animals. The tiger is in the ruler's place appropriate to
its strength and majesty, and his changes are bold and distinct. The leopard is
inferior only to the tiger in rank and power, and his changes are represented by
hundreds of spots, suggesting numerous differentiations, many details. The
ruler's reforms are sketched out in bold outlines (stripes), but the specifics
(spots) are completed by his subordinates. It is through the letter of the law (the
details) that inferior men are made to comply (to change their faces) and show
obedience. This is a reiteration of the superior man's role in the Image: "The
Superior Man regulates the calendar and thus ensures that men are clear about
times and seasons" (Blofeld).

Psychologically interpreted, the tiger can be seen as the Self, the leopard as the
ego, and the small (inferior) men as the complexes -- the habits, appetites, drives
and passions within the unconscious psyche. Cleary’s Taoist commentary warns
the ego to “maintain both the spirit and letter of the law” lest your complexes
rationalize the situation (many spots) and adulterate the Work. If this is the only
changing line, the new hexagram created is number 13, Union of Forces, the
corresponding line of which depicts an incomplete synthesis. Ritsema/Karcher’s
Confucian commentary for 13:6 sums it up succinctly: “Purpose not-yet acquired
indeed.” This strongly implies that the “inferior men” in the current line
(whatever they symbolize in the situation at hand) represent cause for concern:
Will the Metamorphosis be successful or not? Ritsema/Karcher’s: “Righteous
persistence brings good fortune to those who remain where they are” portrays
the best strategy for dealing with this situation. Anthony’s commentary nicely
supplements this in contemporary idiom.

Our objective is to abstract patterns from Nature (right hemisphere
thinking), but many proposed patterns do not in fact correspond to the
data. Thus all proposed patterns must be subjected to the sieve of critical
analysis (left hemisphere thinking). The search for patterns without
critical analysis, and rigid skepticism without a search for patterns, are
the antipodes of incomplete science. The effective pursuit of knowledge
requires both functions.
Carl Sagan -- The Dragons of Eden
49 -- Metamorphosis -- 49

A. The image suggests the refinement of details in a transformation. As
the ego consolidates its new position, archetypal forces (complexes, habitual
responses, limiting beliefs) are forced to conform to the altered psychic hierarchy.
Stand pat and hold fast to prevent backsliding.

B. Do nothing until you've analyzed all aspects of the situation at hand.
Beware of inferior forces influencing your choices.

50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY --
THE SACRIFICIAL VESSEL

Other titles: The Cauldron, The Vessel, Rejuvenation, Cosmic Order, The Alchemical
Vessel, "A complete transformation of a person or circumstance." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: The Sacrificial Vessel means great progress and success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Cauldron. Supreme good fortune. Success.

Blofeld: A Sacrificial Vessel -- supreme success!

Liu: The Cauldron. Great good fortune. Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel, Spring significant. Growing. [This hexagram describes
your situation in terms of the imaginative capacity of a sacred vessel. It emphasizes that
securing and imaginatively transforming the material at hand is the adequate way to
handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: hold and transform things in the
vessel!]

Shaughnessy: The Cauldron: Prime auspiciousness; receipt.

Cleary (1): The cauldron is basically good; it is developmental.

Cleary (2): The Cauldron is very auspiciously developmental.

Wu: The Cauldron indicates great auspiciousness and pervasiveness.

The Image

Legge: Wood under a fire -- the image of a Sacrificial Vessel. The superior man
maintains his correctness in every situation to secure the appointment of heaven.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fire over wood: the image of The Cauldron. Thus the superior man
consolidates his fate by making his position correct.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire upon wood. The Superior Man, taking his stance
as righteousness requires, adheres firmly to heaven's decrees.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Liu: Fire above wood symbolizes the Caldron. The superior man makes his destiny firm
with a correct position.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above wood possessing fire. The Vessel. A chun tzu uses correcting
the situation to solidify fate.

Cleary (1): There is fire on top of wood; a cauldron. Thus do superior people stabilize
life in the proper position.

Cleary (2): Fire over wood -- The Cauldron. Leaders stabilize their mandate by
correcting their position.

Wu: There is fire on wood; this is The Cauldron. Thus the jun zi rectifies his position
and consecrates the mandate.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The image of the Sacrificial Vessel shows us wood entering a fire,
which suggests the idea of cooking. The sages cooked their sacrifices to God and nourished
their able ministers with feasts. We have the trigrams of Flexible Obedience and Quick
Intelligence, with the magnetic line advanced to the ruler's place and responded to by her
dynamic correlate below. All these things give the auspice of successful progress.

Legge: The written Chinese character for Sacrificial Vessel represents a cauldron with
three feet and two "ears" used for cooking and preparing food for both the table and the
altar. The hexagram pictures this vessel -- the divided first line represents the feet, the
three undivided lines above represent the body, the divided fifth line shows the ears (or
carrying rings), and the top line is the handle by which the container is carried or
suspended from a hook.

The lesson of the hexagram is that the nourishing of men of talent and virtue
intimates great progress and success. The K'ang-hsi editors point out that the distinction
between hexagram number forty-eight, The Well, and this one is the difference between
the nourishment of the people in general and the specific nourishing of worthy men. They
add that the reality of sacrifice is nourishing in this regard.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: You are the Sacrificial Vessel.

The Superior Man holds to the principles of the Work to attain transcendence.

The usual name for this hexagram is The Cauldron -- specifically, a type of food-
containing vessel which was used in ancient China for religious sacrifices. I prefer
Blofeld’s title of the Sacrificial Vessel as more evocative of the ideas presented in the
figure.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

When the forty-ninth hexagram of Transformation is turned upside down, it
becomes the fiftieth hexagram of the Sacrificial Vessel, thus giving us some valuable
insights into the nuances of meaning in each of the figures. The combined ideas of
transformation and a cauldron used for sacrifices remind us of the alchemical vessel or
retort which "cooked" its contents and transformed them into a higher state of matter --
turned lead into gold in the popular conception. Of course, the true esoteric purpose of the
alchemist was psychological, not physical.

The vessel of the alchemists, like the circle of the psyche and the mandala, must be
closed if the transformation process is to proceed satisfactorily. For the alchemists,
the process took place in the material substances collected in the retort. For us,
this is a symbol representing a similar process taking place within the psyche.
Thus it is said that a wall must be securely built about the psyche before the
reconciliation of the opposites can take place within it, and before the new center
of the individual can be created. ... For if anything is lost the process is nullified
and the final product will be incomplete, imperfect. So long, for instance, as the
individual continues to project his deficiencies, or his values, upon circumstances
or upon another, he does not have an impervious vessel ... Thus the contents
essentially involved in the transformation are seen to be the irrational, instinctual,
not yet human factors of the psyche, the nonego. The human and civilized factors,
those subject to the will, make up the wall of the vessel.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

Now an ancient Chinese cauldron used to contain food intended for religious
sacrifices is not the same thing as a hermetically sealed alchemical retort made to
withstand extreme pressures, but symbolically they are identical images. The ego
sacrifices its autonomy for the good of the Work in the same way that the alchemist
devotes his entire life to the transformation of base metal into gold -- i.e., to transform his
psyche by following the extreme discipline of the Work. Thomas Cleary’s Taoist I-Ching
explicitly tells us that this is the meaning intended here:

The work of refinement is the means by which to sublimate earthly energy and
stabilize celestial energy, causing the raw to ripen and the old to be renewed,
whereby it is possible to illumine the mind and to solidify life. Therefore the
cauldron is basically good and it has a developmental path. The basis is the
potential of everlasting life of goodness; the cooking of the great medicine in the
cauldron is the firing of this living potential to make it incorruptible and
permanent. But in this path there is process and procedure; even the slightest
deviation and the gold elixir will not form. Therefore people must first thoroughly
investigate the true principle.
Liu I-ming

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

In his commentary Legge mentions that the Chinese see an analogy between this
figure and hexagram number forty-eight, The Well. Compare the two figures, noting the
similarities between the first, third, fifth and sixth lines. The component trigrams of the
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Sacrificial Vessel appear in reverse sequence in hexagram number thirty-seven,
Family. What other similarities are there in the two figures? How is the idea of a family
analogous to the idea of a sacrificial vessel?
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows the cauldron overthrown and its feet turned up.
But there will be advantage in getting rid of what was bad in it. Or it shows us the
concubine whose position is improved by means of her son. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A cauldron with legs upturned. Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.
One takes a concubine for the sake of her son. No blame.

Blofeld: To rid it of decaying remnants of meat, the vessel is turned upside down. [Some
actions, though highly improper in themselves, may be properly performed if
circumstances so require; a merely ritualistic conception of right and wrong is not
desirable.] It is not shameful to take a concubine for the sake of bearing sons. [This is
added as an example, immediately acceptable to a traditionally minded Chinese of
something improper in itself which becomes proper when the motive is acceptable.]

Liu: A cauldron overturned by its legs -- it is beneficial to clean out the stagnating matter.
One takes a concubine to get a son. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel: toppling the foot. Harvesting: issuing-forth-from
obstruction. Acquiring a concubine, using one's sonhood. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron's upturned legs; beneficial to expel the bad; getting a
consort together with her son; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): When the cauldron overturns on its base, it is beneficial to eject what is wrong.
Getting a concubine, because of her child she is not faulted.

Wu: The cauldron tips over and conveniently spills its stale food, like a man taking a
secondary wife because of her son. There will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The cauldron is emptied -- this is not incorrect. There will be
advantage in getting rid of what was bad so that the subject of the line will thereby follow
the more noble subject of line four. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is still not wrong. To follow
the man of worth. Blofeld: There is nothing improper about up-ending a sacrificial
vessel to rid it of decaying matter. Such actions are necessary in the pursuit of what is
noble. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet rebelling indeed. Using adhering-to valuing indeed.
Cleary (2): That is not bad. To go along with what is valuable. Wu: There is nothing to
worry about. The outlook is after prominence.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Legge: Line one is magnetic, and little can be expected from her, but she has a proper
correlate in the dynamic fourth line. The overthrow of the cauldron, causing its feet to be
turned upward towards the fourth place empties it of what was bad in it. This is deemed
fortunate, because it thereby hastens the cooperation between the two lines. A similar idea
is that a concubine is less honorable than a wife --like the overthrown cauldron. But if she
has a son, while the wife has none, he will be his father's heir, and the concubine-mother
will share in the honor of his position.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the evil is being discarded. This opens up opportunities for renewal, no
matter how lowly a position the man may temporarily occupy.

Wing: To attain a goal that is worthy in itself, you may need to use means that are
considered unorthodox. If this goal has been a long-term objective, you may have to begin
again, using entirely new methods. This is not a mistake. You can succeed no matter how
inexperienced you are.

Editor: An alchemical vessel is a metaphor for the psyche undergoing the transformation
of the Work. To rid the vessel of what is "bad" (Wilhelm calls it "stagnating stuff") is to
rid oneself of limiting beliefs, negative emotions or whatever harmful element may be
suggested by the matter at hand. After years of work, the testing process becomes
increasingly refined -- one goes through long periods of stress with perfect equanimity,
and begins to take pride in one's strength of will. At about that point, something will
happen to evoke an emotional response, and one becomes suddenly aware that the
refining process is not complete until all of the scum comes to the top and is eliminated
from the psyche. The symbolism of the concubine suggests a rather humble or simple
emotional component, union with which produces a new and promising synthesis.

When this part of the work has been accomplished it is as if the individual had
built a psychic container, and this must be done to the very best of his ability, or it
may go to pieces when the strains and stresses of the transformation process
begin. For there will still remain certain things, and these usually the very
darkest, that will come to light when he explores the unconscious ... These blackest
shadows, that the alchemists called the state of nigredo, will probably prove to be
connected with the unadapted emotions representing the nonpersonal part of the
psyche, and it is most painful to realize that they actually exist within oneself.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. After ridding oneself of limiting beliefs, a conscious connection with basic
principles brings forth new and valuable insights.

B. Expel dross and embrace simplicity.

C. The simplest, least complicated solution is the best one.

D. An image of dealing with unconscious material -- confronting one's hidden
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

issues.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows the cauldron with the things to be cooked in it. If
he can say, "My enemy dislikes me, but he cannot approach me," there will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is food in the cauldron. My comrades are envious, but they
cannot harm me. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The Ting possesses solidity. My enemies are in difficulty and there is nothing
they can do to me -- good fortune!

Liu: The cauldron is filled with food. My associates are jealous, but they cannot harm me.
Good fortune. [Even though a person profits from his business or performs his work
carefully and well, he should still beware lest others harm or disturb him.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel possesses substance. My companion possesses affliction.
Not me able to approach. Significant.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron has substance: my enemy has an illness; it is not able to
approach me; auspicious.

Cleary (1): The cauldron is filled. One’s enemy is jealous, but cannot get at one; this is
lucky.

Cleary (2): The cauldron has content. My enemy is afflicted, but luckily cannot get to me.

Wu: The cauldron is full. My associates have ill feelings about me, but they cannot do
anything to me. This is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Let the subject of the line be careful where he goes. My enemy
dislikes me, but there will in the end be no fault to which he can point. Wilhelm/
Baynes: Be cautious about where you go. This brings no blame in the end. Blofeld: The
first sentence indicates a need for caution. "My enemies are in trouble" indicates that I
shall remain blameless to the end. Ritsema/Karcher: Considering places it indeed.
Completing without surpassing indeed. Cleary (2): Being careful about where one goes.
After all there is no resentment. Wu: Be mindful of where to go. There will be no
resentment in the end.

Legge: The enemy is the first line which solicits. Line two is able to resist the solicitation,
and the auspice is favorable.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man achieves great success, thereby incurring the envy of others. No harm will
come to him, since he is not distracted from his purpose.

Wing: You may feel a need to stand apart from your fellow man to achieve a significant
aim. Such a stance will invite envy, but this will not create a problem for you. Good fortune
is indicated.

Editor: If the Sacrificial Vessel is seen as an analogue of the psyche, it is easy to see
this line as a commentary on not allowing inner forces (appetites, passions, emotions, etc.)
to overcome the ego's control of the Work. Note that the Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu
translations are not conditional like Legge's: "If he can say..." Liu's note is derived from
the Confucian commentary, which seems unduly grave: note that the original line is not
overtly cautionary. Generally, you are protected despite any perceived threats.

The Oracles urge men to devote themselves to things divine, and not to give way to
the promptings of the irrational soul, for, to such as fail herein, it is significantly
said, "Thy vessel the beasts of the earth shall inhabit."
W.W. Westcott -- The Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster

A. The situation is favorable, but you must be on guard to maintain it.

B. Divisive forces covet that which is under your control, but cannot harm you if you
are careful.

C. Your idea has merit. (A cauldron with food in it.) Develop it carefully and don't
get carried away. (Protect it from the enemies of doubt, over-enthusiasm, etc.)
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows the cauldron with the places of its ears changed.
The progress of its subject is thus stopped. The fat flesh of the pheasant which is in the
cauldron will not be eaten. But the genial rain will come, and the grounds for repentance
will disappear. There will be good fortune in the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The handle of the cauldron is altered. One is impeded in his way of
life. The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. Once rain falls, remorse is spent. Good fortune
comes in the end.

Blofeld: The handles of the Ting have been detached, so it is difficult to move it. [A delay
due to some remissness on our part.] The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. [Because of our
remissness an opportunity goes to waste.] Suddenly rain [An omen of good fortune, of
heaven’s nourishing powers] comes, regret wanes and, ultimately, there is good fortune.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Liu: The handles of the cauldron are changed. Its activity will be obstructed. The fat of
the pheasant is not eaten. Once the rain comes, regret vanishes. Good fortune in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel: the ears skinned. Its movement clogged. Pheasant juice
not taken-in. On-all-sides rain lessens repenting. Completing significant.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron's ears are bridled: his motion is blocked; the pheasant fat is
not edible; the countryside rain diminishes; regret, in the end auspicious.

Cleary (1): The lifting hooks of the cauldron are removed; the activity is impeded. Rich
meat is not eaten. When it rains, lack is regretted. It turns out well.

Cleary (2): The knobs of the cauldron are removed, so its use is impeded. Pheasant fat is
not eaten. When it rains, regret is removed and all is well in the end.

Wu: The cauldron’s earrings malfunction. It cannot be carried. The delicious pheasant
dish is not enjoyed. Timely rain washes regret away. There will be auspiciousness in the
end.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is the cauldron with the places for its ears changed -- he has
failed in what was required of him in his situation. Wilhelm/Baynes: He has missed the
idea. Blofeld: What is said about the handles of the Ting implies our failure in carrying
out our duty. Ritsema/Karcher: Letting-go its righteousness indeed. Cleary (2):
When the knobs of the cauldron are removed, it loses its meaning. Wu: It loses its
usefulness.

Legge: Line three is dynamic in his proper place -- if his correlate were the magnetic line
five, the auspice would be entirely good. But instead of five, his correlate is the dynamic
six. What is required is that he and line five, instead of six, should be correlates. The place
of the ears at five has been changed and the advance of line three is thereby stopped; the
good meat in the cauldron will not be eaten. But if he keeps firm line five will eventually
seek his company, the yin and the yang will mingle, and their union will be followed by the
genial rain. The issue will be good.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is faced with obstacles. His abilities go unnoticed and talents unused. But
this is only a temporary setback, as the tension will be relieved.

Wing: Your unique talents are not being used because they are not recognized. This may
be due to erroneous thinking on your part. Maintain a positive attitude about yourself, and
things will change for the better.

Editor: The Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu translations all refer to the "ears" as "handles." We
are justified therefore in combining the ideas of both. Ears are the organs by which we
hear, and handles are devices by which something is grasped. To hear and to comprehend
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

what is heard are the ideas conveyed. However, the ears have been changed or altered, so
the image suggests that a different message or new set of rules and/or circumstances is
now operative; the old rules or concepts no longer apply. The situation has evolved, but
progress is stopped because one hasn't comprehended the changes yet. "The fat of the
pheasant is not eaten" is just another way of saying that one has missed the point, or has
not been nourished by the new insight. However, the situation will not remain static -- a
coming union of thought and feeling will create the catharsis needed to effect the
transformation.

The rain showed that the tension between consciousness and the unconscious was
being resolved. Although at the time I was not able to understand the meaning of
the dream beyond these few hints, new forces were released in me which helped
me to carry the experiment with the unconscious to a conclusion.
Jung -- Memories, Dreams, Reflections

A. The dynamics of your situation have changed, but you are still operating on old
assumptions and have missed the point or not gotten the message. However, the
condition is temporary and will resolve itself naturally.

B. The image suggests a stalemate followed by eventual resolution.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows the sacrificial vessel with its feet broken, and its
contents, designed for the ruler's use, overturned and spilled. Its subject will be made to
blush for shame. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The legs of the cauldron are broken. The prince's meal is spilled and
his person soiled. Misfortune.

Blofeld: The legs of the Ting snap. The prince's food is overturned and his person soiled -

    misfortune! [Through gross carelessness an opportunity to advance our interests is not
    only lost but transformed into an occasion of trouble.]

Liu: The legs of the cauldron are split. The duke's meal is spilled and his face turns red.
Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel: a severed stand. Overthrowing a princely stew. Its form
soiled. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron's broken leg: Overturns the duke's stew; his punishment is
execution-in-chamber; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The cauldron’s legs are broken, spilling the food received for service. The
physical being is enriched, but there is misfortune.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Cleary (2): The cauldron breaks its legs, spilling your food; your face drips. This is
unfortunate.

Wu: The cauldron’s legs are broken. The duke’s feast is spilled over, resulting in
capital punishment. Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: How can he be trusted? Wilhelm/Baynes: How can one still trust
him? Blofeld: The prince's meal is overturned -- how is it possible to continue enjoying
his confidence? Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore trustworthy thus indeed? Cleary (2):
Now that you have spilled your food, what happened to your confidence? Wu: How can
there be trust?

The Master said: "Virtue small and office high; wisdom small and plans great;
strength small and burden heavy: where such conditions exist, it is seldom that they do
not end in evil. As it is said in the I Ching, `The tripod's feet are overthrown, and the
ruler's food is overturned. The body of him who is thus indicated is wet with shame:
there will be evil.'"

Legge: Line four is the minister charged with difficult duties. Although dynamic, he is in
a magnetic position with a magnetic correlate in line one. Weak in himself, and
without an able helper, he has failed to do his proper work, and cannot be trusted again.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man fails to discharge his responsibilities because of personal inadequacies.
Great plans supported by limited knowledge, heavy loads by meager strength, high office
by weak character -- these result in shame and disaster.

Wing: You do not have the capability to achieve the goals you have in mind. You have not
been realistic about your position. You are lacking in either energy, commitment,
information, or assistance. Going forth with your plans will invite disaster.

Editor: The image suggests misfortune brought about by inexperience, incompetence,
lack of capacity, divided loyalties, willful disobedience, or plain ignorance. In my
experience, the line does not necessarily always imply blame: sometimes, with the best will
in the world, one just isn't capable of coping with superior forces in a situation. If this is
the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes #18, Work on What has been
Spoiled, implying that you should clean up the mess you’ve just made.

If you have assumed a character above your strength, you have both acted in this
matter in an unbecoming way, and you have neglected that which you might have
fulfilled.
Epictetus

A. A failure is portended. Only you can determine if blame is involved.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows the cauldron with yellow ears and rings of metal in
them. There will be advantage in being firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The cauldron has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.
Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: The Ting has yellow handles with golden rings attached -- righteous persistence
brings reward! [The faults described in the last two notes have now been put right; the
position is even better than before they were committed.]

Liu: The cauldron has yellow handles and golden carrying rings. Continuing brings
advantage. [A time of benefit.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel: yellow ears, metallic rings. Harvesting Trial.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron's yellow ears and metal bar; beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): The cauldron has yellow hooks with a gold handle. It is beneficial to be single-
minded.

Cleary (2): ... It is beneficial to be correct.

Wu: The cauldron’s ears are yellow and its carrying pole is covered with gold. It is
advantageous to be persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The central position of the line is taken as a proof of the solid virtue
of its subject. Wilhelm/Baynes: The yellow handles of the cauldron are central, in
order to receive what is real. Blofeld: The central position of this line in the upper
trigram implies solid worth. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering uses activating substance
indeed. Cleary (2): The knobs of the cauldron are filled through the center. Wu: What it
holds is substantial.

Legge: "Line five," says the Daily Lecture, "praises the ruler as condescending to the
worthy with his humble virtue." Yellow has occurred repeatedly as a "correct color," and
here the yellow ears and strong rings of metal are intended to intensify our appreciation of
the occupant of line five. As the line is magnetic, a caution is added about being firm and
correct.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is modest and approachable. He thereby attracts associates, who can
provide able help and advice.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50

Wing: If he is humble and receptive, a person in a position of authority will make further
progress in the development of his character. He will attain insights and wisdom. He
should continue developing his expanding awareness.

Editor: The Wilhelm version of the Confucian commentary gives us a more accessible
clue as to the meaning of this line: "...In order to receive what is real." The essential idea
is that of the ruler's receptivity to a higher power. Openness to advice is the basic gestalt --
"ears" are receptive to messages, and "handles" suggest grasp or comprehension. Metal is
often symbolic of the mental qualities, and yellow metal, rendered as "gold" in most
translations of this line, suggests the highest form of mentality -- wisdom, divine
intelligence, cosmic truth, etc. Gold also often symbolizes intuition, the highest form of
comprehension.

The attitude of the serious adept was genuinely religious, and the most important
of the philosophical alchemists confessed in their writings that the religious side of
their "art" was the focus of their interest and endeavors -- above all their inner
experiences during the opus.
A. Jaffe -- The Myth of Meaning

A. The images suggests an open receptivity to harmonious influences: Go to center
and listen to your inner voice.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows the cauldron with rings of jade. There will be
great good fortune, and all action taken will be in every way advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The cauldron has rings of jade. Great good fortune. Nothing that
would not act to further.

Blofeld: The Ting has jade handles -- great good fortune! [A further improvement on the
progress indicated in the preceding note.]

Liu: The cauldron has carrying rings of jade. Great good fortune. Benefit in everything.

Ritsema/Karcher: The Vessel: jade rings. The great significant. Without not Harvesting.

Shaughnessy: The cauldron's jade bar; greatly auspicious; there is nothing not beneficial.

Cleary (1): The cauldron has a jade handle. This is very auspicious, entirely beneficial.

Cleary (2): The jade handle of the cauldron is very auspicious, beneficial to all.

Wu: The cauldron’s carrying pole is decorated with jade. There will be great fortune and
nothing disadvantageous.
50 -- The Sacrificial Vessel -- 50
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The rings of jade are at the very top -- the dynamic and magnetic
meet in their due proportions. Wilhelm/Baynes: The jade rings in the highest place
show the firm and the yielding complementing each other properly. Blofeld: The first
part of the passage is indicated by this top line-- a firm line which meets the yielding fifth
harmoniously. Ritsema/Karcher: Solid and supple articulating indeed. Cleary (2):
The jade handle is above. Hard and soft join. Wu: The strong and the weak are balanced.

Legge: Line six is dynamic, but his strength is tempered by being in a magnetic place. It
is this which makes the handle to be of jade, which, though very hard has a peculiar and
rich softness all its own. The auspice of the line is excellent. The Great Minister (line six)
performs for the ruler (line five) by helping his government and nourishing the worthy.
This is the part that the handle does for the cauldron.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The sage imparts wise counsel to the benefit of the worthy recipient. His gentle and
sincere behavior pleases the heavens, which dispense good fortune to all.

Wing: There exists a general atmosphere of clarity and greatness. All circumstances are
favorable. The inner self has reached a highly developed stage. Everyone will benefit.

Editor: The top line of a hexagram often represents the sage or holy man. Here the
wisdom of the sage is offered to the ruler. Psychologically, the ego is receptive to
instruction from its higher Self. The Confucian commentary alludes to the proper union of
dynamic and magnetic forces -- this is the Holy Marriage of the Perennial Philosophy. The
image suggests the Chinese concept of Li, the character for which combines the ideas of
heaven's ordinances with that of a receptive vessel.

The term Li signifies one of the most important concepts in Confucian ethics. [The
character] is made up of two elements, one representing influence coming down
from heaven, and the other ... representing a sacrificial vessel ... Li came to
include all the customary regulations and acknowledged practices which govern
social relationships.
D.H. Smith -- Confucius

A. One is receptive to the highest influence.

B. An image of the harmonious union of thought and feeling.

51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-ONE –
SHOCK/THUNDER

Other titles: The Arousing, Thunder, The Symbol of Startling Movement, Shake, The
Beginning of Movement, Shocking, The Thunderclap, Action, Motion, Sudden Change,
Surprise! "The necessity to keep tranquil in the midst of upheaval." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Shock intimates ease and development. When the time of movement which it
indicates comes, the subject of the hexagram will be found looking out with apprehension,
and yet smiling and talking cheerfully. When the movement like a crash of thunder
terrifies all within a hundred miles, he will be like the sincere worshipper who is not
startled into dropping his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock brings success. Shock comes --oh, oh! Laughing words -- ha,
ha! The shock terrifies for a hundred miles, and he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon
and chalice.

Blofeld: Thunder -- success! Thunder comes with a terrible noise, laughing and
shouting in awesome glee and frightening people for a hundred miles around. The
sacrificial wine is not spilt. [This suggests that the holder of the sacrificial vessel is not
easily alarmed or else that he is very wise and able to distinguish between the
apparently dangerous and the truly dangerous.]

Liu: Thunder. Success. Thunder comes -- ho ho! Speaking and laughing -- ha ha! It
shocks and terrifies for a hundred miles. But one does not drop the spoon or chalice.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake, Growing. Shake coming: frightening, frightening. Laughing
words, shrieking, shrieking. Shake scaring a hundred miles. Not losing the ladle, the
libation. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of a disturbing and inspiring
shock. It emphasizes that rousing things to new activity, the action of Shake is the
adequate way to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: stir things up!]

Shaughnessy: Thunder: Receipt; thunder comes so renewingly; laughter and talk yaya;
thunder alarms one hundred miles; not losing the ladle or goblet.

Cleary (1): Thunder is developmental. When thunder comes, there is alarm, then
laughter. Thunder startles for a hundred miles, but one does not lose the spoon and wine.

Cleary (2): Thunder comes through. Etc.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Wu: Motion indicates pervasiveness. When Motion comes, it frightens people. Later, it
makes people talk and laugh. Its majesty reaches one hundred li in all directions. There is
no misplacement of the ladle or sacrificial wine.

The Image

Legge: The image of Thunder, being repeated, forms Shock. The superior man, in
accordance with this, is fearful and apprehensive, cultivates his virtue, and examines his
faults.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder repeated: the image of Shock. Thus in fear and trembling
the superior man sets his life in order and examines himself.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes continuous thunder. The Superior Man in fear and
trembling seeks to improve himself.

Liu: Thunder doubled symbolizes shock. The superior man contemplates himself with
fear and caution.

Ritsema/Karcher: Reiterated thunder. Shake. A chun tzu uses anxious fearing to
adjust inspecting.

Cleary (1): Traveling thunder reverberates. Thus superior people cautiously practice
introspection.

Cleary (2): Repeated thunder reverberates. Developed people practice introspection
with caution.

Wu: One thunderclap after another constitutes hexagram Motion. Thus the jun zi
reflects and rectifies for fear of being wrong.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His feeling of dread leads to happiness because he is thereby made to
adopt proper laws for himself. The movement startles the distant and frightens the near,
yet he makes the proper sacrifices the same as always.

Legge: Shock consists of the trigram for Thunder doubled. (This trigram also represents
Movement and the Eldest Son.) The hexagram therefore symbolizes a crash or peal of
thunder, and combined with the idea of movement shows a sudden change taking place in
the kingdom. The lesson is the conduct to be pursued in a time of sudden change through
an awareness of danger and the proper regulation of oneself.

A successful issue is predicted if the dynamic first line can be superior to the two
magnetic lines above him. It is in the idea of the hexagram that he should be moving and
advancing. Although sensible of the danger, he is confident and self-possessed -- so much
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

so that he can calmly perform his religious duties during the prevailing chaos. This is
proper behavior for the eldest son, who must eventually assume the duties of his father.

Anthony: In the I Ching shock means being subjected to unsettling events. It also
means perceiving and reacting to these events ... perceiving, in any of these changes, that a
new set of limits, or deprivations, has been placed on our life which seems to restrict or
even penalize us. This sense of being projected by events into a sort of emotional trap is
what this hexagram calls “Fate.” Acknowledgement of this fate, or trap, and the imperative

    to find the way out – is one of the purposes of shock. As far as the I Ching is concerned,
    there is only one way out – to undergo spiritual development.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: During sudden changes, adjust your tempo and move ahead, remembering
that while conditions may alter, the goal remains the same.

The Superior Man double-checks his premises, confronts his weak spots and adheres to
the rules and ideals of the Work.

The image here is one of a sudden, dramatic release of energy, power and
force. To receive this hexagram without changing lines can refer to almost any abrupt,
startling or unexpected situation. Sometimes it is the oracle's way of saying: "Surprise!” It
can also be a kind of reprimand for asking a dumb or inappropriate question -- the oracle
is "shocked” by your temerity, ignorance, etc. In such instances there is often an element of
wry humor in the situation -- usually at the ego's expense. On rare occasions, it is possible
to receive this hexagram as a warning about an upcoming event which has no bearing on
the question posed. Should you receive such an oracle, be extremely vigilant – as always,
the advice to the superior man in the Image suggests the proper course.

A true test of devotion to the Work is to maintain one's will under all circumstances.
The world may be falling apart around us, but the adept does not ruin the performance of
his sacrifice: the ego continues the Work regardless of conditions, and keeps a cool head
under all circumstances.

Have no fear of sudden terror
or of assault from wicked men,
since Yahweh will be your guarantor,
He will keep your steps from the snare.
Proverbs 3: 25-26

Both Yahweh and Christ are what Jung calls "god images” which exist in one form
or another in every human psyche, whether it is consciously religious or not. The god
image is synonymous with the Self, and the implication of the above quotation from
Proverbs is that as long as the ego remains devoted to the Work -- in I Ching terms:
"maintains the sacrifice” -- it is under the protection of the Self.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

The Perfect Man is godlike. Though the great swamps blaze, they cannot burn
him; though the great rivers freeze, they cannot chill him; though swift lightning
splits the hills and howling gales shake the sea, they cannot frighten him. A man
like this rides the clouds and mist, straddles the sun and moon, and wanders
beyond the four seas. Even life and death have no effect on him, much less the
rules of profit and loss!
Chuang Tzu

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject, when the movement approaches,
looking out and around with apprehension, and afterwards smiling and talking cheerfully.
There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock comes -- Oh, Oh! Then follow laughing words -- Ha, Ha!
Good fortune.

Blofeld: Thunder comes with a mighty roar which changes to noisy glee -- good
fortune!

Liu: Thunder comes -- ho ho! Later there are smiles and happy words -- ha ha! Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake coming: frightening, frightening. After laughing words,
shrieking, shrieking. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Thunder comes so renewingly; afterwards laughter and talk yaya;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): When thunder comes, alarm; afterward, laughter. Auspicious.

Wu: When motion comes, it frightens people. Later, it makes people talk and laugh. This
is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: That feeling of dread leads to happiness because he adopts proper
laws for his course. Wilhelm/Baynes: Fear brings good fortune. Afterward one has a
rule. Blofeld: Its frightening roar causes fear which leads to happiness; its noisy glee is
followed by good order. [Fear is often a good mentor; by causing us to change our ways
it leads to happiness.] Ritsema/Karcher: Anxiety involving blessing indeed.
Afterwards possessing by- consequence indeed. Cleary (2): Fear brings fortune.
Afterward there is a model. Wu: Fear leads to blessings. Law and order will follow.

Legge: What is said on line one is little more than a repetition of the principal part of the
Judgment. The line is dynamic in a dynamic place, and gives a good auspice.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, an unexpected movement causes the man to be apprehensive. But he
soon smiles with confident relief as the ordeal passes.

Wing: An unexpected event may frighten you. You may see it as dangerous, and all the
feelings that accompany danger will rise up in you. Yet the ordeal will end, bringing you
great relief. Good fortune is indicated.

Editor: Blofeld's note on the Confucian commentary sums up the meaning of the line
best: "Fear is often a good mentor; by causing us to change our ways, it leads to
happiness.” When this is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes Number
sixteen, Enthusiasm, giving us an altogether energetic and action-oriented image.

When a vision comes from the thunder beings of the west, it comes with terror like
a thunder storm; but when the storm of vision has passed, the world is greener
and happier; for wherever the truth of vision comes upon the world, it is like a
rain. The world, you see, is happier after the terror of the storm.
Black Elk

A. Powerful forces suddenly upset the status-quo. The way is cleared for something
new. Remain calm.

B. A surprise causes one to re-arrange one's thinking. Fear is followed by relief.

C. Image of "A close call."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject, when the movement approaches in a
position of peril. She judges it better to let go the articles in her possession, and to ascend
to a very lofty height. There is no occasion for her to pursue after the things she has let go;
in seven days she will find them.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock comes bringing danger. A hundred thousand times you lose
your treasures and must climb the nine hills. Do not go in pursuit of them. After seven
days you will get them back again.

Blofeld: Thunder approaches -- trouble is at hand! Sadly he lets go of his valuables and
fleeing sets foot among the nine hills. He should not search for them; in seven days he will
regain them.

Liu: Thunder comes, causing danger. You will lose a great deal of your wealth, then
climb nine hills without searching for it. After seven days you will regain it.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake coming: adversity. A hundred-thousand lost coins. Climbing
tending-towards the ninth mound. No pursuit. The seventh day: acquiring.

Shaughnessy: Thunder comes so dangerously; one loses cowries; sacrificing to the nine
peaks; do not follow, in seven days you will get it.

Cleary (1): Thunder comes: dangerous thoughts. Losing valuables, you climb nine hills:
Don’t chase it – you’ll get it in seven days. [Mounting strength with weakness, arbitrary
imagination gets too high, and one tries to do what one cannot do. This is losing basic
sense and acting on dangerous thoughts ... It is fortunate if you maintain rectitude when
you are weak, not daring to act arbitrarily...]

Cleary (2): Thunder comes – dangerous. Remembering that you have lost your treasure,
you climb nine hills. But do not pursue it; in seven days you will get it.

Wu: He encounters severe movements and presumes to have lost his precious possessions.
He climbs up a hill that has nine winding passes, There is no need to search for his
possessions. He will recover them after seven days. [He climbs up to high ground to
distance himself from the movement below.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A magnetic line is mounted on a dynamic one. Wilhelm/Baynes: It
rests upon a firm line. Blofeld: That the approach of thunder presages trouble is
indicated by the position of this yielding line over a firm one. Ritsema/Karcher: Riding
a solid indeed. Cleary (2): The danger of thunder coming is mounting the unyielding.
Wu: Because he rides on a yang. [The weak second six “rides” on the strong first nine and
finds what a perilous situation he is in.]

Legge: The peril in line two is suggested by her position immediately above line one. The
rest of the symbolism is obscure, and Chu Hsi says he does not understand it. The subject
of the line does what she can to get out of danger, and finally, as is signified by the central
position of the line, the issue is better than could have been expected. On the symbolism of
"seven days," Ch'eng-tzu says: "The places of a hexagram amount to six. The number
seven is the first of another hexagram. When the movement symbolized by Shock has
gone through its cycle, things will be as they were before."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: An uprising endangers the man. He accepts the material losses and ascends to lofty
heights inaccessible to the threatening forces. After the shock and upheaval have subsided,
his property will be restored without his fighting for it.

Wing: A cataclysmic upheaval can cause you great losses. Do not try to resist or fight the
forces, since this is impossible. Instead, remove yourself from the dangerous situation.
Become inaccessible. In time you will recoup your losses.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Editor: Symbolically, the symbolism is not obscure at all: the basic idea is to transcend
your habitual responses and view them from a higher perspective. When things have
settled down again, losses will prove to be illusory.

Verily destruction is the foundation of existence,
And the tearing down thou seest
Is but the assembling of material
for a greater structure...
Deluded are they who say,
"Man liveth by the Mercy of the Lord."

Know ye
That the balance of Mercy and Severity
Is the continuance of every life,
Yea, and of this whole universe.
P.F. Case -- The Book of Tokens

A. A new situation renders old methods obsolete.

B. Detach yourself from your accustomed responses and wait for the situation to
mature. Losses are imaginary.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject distraught amid the startling
movements going on. If those movements excite her to right action, there will be no
mistake.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock comes and makes one distraught. If Shock spurs to action
one remains free of misfortune.

Blofeld: Thunderous impetuosity -- to emulate it at this time will not give rise to harm.
[The Superior Man usually acts calmly and carefully, but there are times when
impetuosity serves a good purpose or, at the very least, does no particular harm.]

Liu: Thunder comes causing a terrified manner. But if one is cautious, one remains free
of disaster.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake: reviving, reviving. Shake moving without blunder.

Shaughnessy: Thunder is so slow; thunder moves without inspection.

Cleary (1): Frightened by thunder; wary action is free from trouble.

Cleary (2): The thunder is faint. Act vigorously, and there will be no trouble.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Wu: He is frightened and uneasy because of the movement, but will not incur misfortune
for his undertakings.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her position is unsuitable to her. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is
not the appropriate one. Blofeld: Thunderous impetuosity is indicated by the unsuitable
position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed.
Cleary (2): The position is not appropriate. Wu: His position is improper.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place, but if she moves on to the fourth place,
which would be correct for her, the issue will not be bad.

Anthony: The shock of encountering our fate, which seems unbearably harsh, causes
emotional trauma. It is as if we are suddenly and irrevocably put into a bad predicament
with no options. This negativism, however, means we are still under the effects of shock. If
we can withdraw from this negative view, we will see that there are workable and correct
means out of the problem. We need to be open-minded in order that the options can
become visible. First, we must “keep still” within, refusing to look at the negative images,
or listen to the voices of our inferiors.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The startling strokes of fate bring mental conflict to the man. He should retain
presence of mind. If he tailors his responses appropriately, he will overpower these
external blows.

Wing: An external blow of fate will put to a test your inner strength. Try, at all costs, to
maintain your composure. Look for an avenue of change that will alleviate the danger.

Editor: Wilhelm comments: "The word su, here rendered by ‘distraught,’ denotes
literally the reviving movements of insects still stiff after their winter sleep.”
Ritsema/Karcher translate SU as: "Regain vital energy, courage or strength; bring to life,
cheer up; relief; lit.: herb whose smell revives weary spirits. The doubled character
intensifies this quality.” The image is one of groggy confusion during a time demanding
decisive action: "Wake up and smell the coffee!” Wilhelm also mentions that the line has
reference to a foreordained or fated situation -- the shock of fate. The idea is that your fate
is demanding that you get moving, that you wake up from your torpor and take action in
accordance with the goals of the Work.

The marvel is that there is not a perpetual state of war within the psyche, for each
of these elements is endowed with energy and so cannot die. Fortunately for our
sanity, many of these irreconcilable elements lie deep within the unconscious,
locked in primordial sleep; those which may have stirred are shut away in
separate compartments. But as life progresses and an increase of consciousness is

51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

achieved, the inner conflicts awaken, and the problem of reconciling the
oppositions they reveal has to be undertaken as a serious and urgent task.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Wake up and resolve your confusion.

B. Get a move on -- drastic circumstance demand drastic responses.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject, amid the startling movements,
supinely sinking deeper in the mud.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock is mired.

Blofeld: After the thunderstorm, the paths are muddy.

Liu: Thunder causes mire. [Even with a humble manner, a person can achieve nothing
during this time. If birth time and zodiac symbols are not favorable, one will be involved
in trouble.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake: releasing the bog.

Shaughnessy: Thunder is followed by mud.

Cleary (1): Thunder gets bogged down.

Wu: He has gotten himself into muddy ground.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The light in him has not yet been brilliantly developed. Wilhelm/
Baynes: It is not yet brilliant enough. Blofeld: This implies muddled thinking.
Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet shining indeed. Cleary (2): Thunder getting bogged down
is not illuminating. Wu: He cannot bring himself to a bright spot.

Legge: The fourth line is dynamic in a magnetic place, and is pressed by the magnetic
lines on either side, hence he is seen as supinely sinking in the mud. Compare what
Confucius says about him with hexagram 21:4 -- "His light has not yet been sufficiently
displayed.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is unable to make progress against an unyielding situation and remains
trapped by its stubborn resistance.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Wing: The Shocking event will reduce you to immobility. This comes about because of a
befuddled mind, confused and unprepared. You cannot make any progress under the
circumstances.

Editor: The image is of one who is trapped in obtuseness and ambiguity, as in mud.
Muddy: Unclear, as in: "This is as clear as mud.” Note that no value judgment is attached
to the line. Meditation on the similarities between this line and 21:4 is useful.

But as the mind matures its principles tend to harden and gradually become fixed,
and it becomes unable to accept fresh material which will not fit easily into the
existing structure. Thus it loses contact with the dynamism of reality. Its enclosing
walls of dogmatic opinion become unable to adapt to changing circumstances,
and if faced with a major challenge of ideas it can only collapse, leaving the
bewildered mind within to cope as best it may with the apparent chaos that
surrounds it. The lesson here is that any structure is only defensible as long as it
remains flexible and capable of evolution; life itself is in a state of constant flux
and no merely human construction can hope to survive if it cannot adapt.
A. Douglas -- The Tarot

A. You are immobilized by ignorance and lack of clarity.

B. The time calls for action, but your inertia bogs you down.

C. Ambiguity emasculates action -- wait for the situation to clarify.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject going and coming amidst the startling
movements of the time, and always in peril; but perhaps she will not incur loss, and find
business which she can accomplish.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock goes hither and thither. Danger. However, nothing at all is
lost. Yet there are things to be done.

Blofeld: Thunder comes and goes alternately -- trouble is at hand! Careful thought will
avert loss, but there are affairs needing attention.

Liu: Thunder going back and forth brings danger. No great loss. Something remains to
be achieved.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake going, coming adversity. Intention without losing possesses
affairs.

Shaughnessy: Thunder goes and comes so dangerously; there is no loss, there is
service.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

Cleary (1): Actively mulling over dangerous plans. No loss; there is concern.

Cleary (2): Thunder goes and comes – dangerous. On reflection there is no loss; there
is something to do.

Wu: Either advance or retreat is precarious. There will be no big loss, only small problems.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her doings are full of risk, but must be undertaken in her central
position. Far will she be from incurring any loss. Wilhelm/Baynes: One walks in danger.
The "things to be done" are in the middle, hence nothing at all is lost. Blofeld: The first
sentence implies that danger threatens our activities. That affairs need our attention is
indicated by this central line of the upper trigram. There will be no important losses.
Ritsema/Karcher: Exposed moving indeed. One's affairs located-in the center. The
great without losing indeed. Cleary (2): This is acting in peril. Wu: This means that any
undertaking will be risky... Problems will be solved through compromise.

Legge: Line five is magnetic in a dynamic place where the action of the hexagram is
concentrated. Hence she is always in peril, but her central position indicates safety in the
end.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is exposed to repeated shocks and continuing peril. As long as he maintains
a central position, safety is assured in the end.

Wing: The shocks will continue and you will be faced with constant troubles and
difficulties. You can survive the times if you actively change with the changes, thus
remaining centered internally and externally.

Editor: Although there is no relationship of correspondence, this line is similar to line
three. Psychologically interpreted, the idea is that the ego is responsible for the Work in
spacetime, and it is never easy -- every choice you make is a judgment call.

The practice of shock therapy shatters the distorted ego complex to the point of
extinction; contact can then be reestablished with the hope of forming new
patterns.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. "Roll with the punches" and keep your head.

B. Don't allow unsettled conditions to divert you from the Work. Do what the
situation requires.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject, amidst the startling movements of the
time, in breathless dismay and looking around her with trembling apprehension. If she
takes action, there will be evil. If, while the startling movements have not reached her own
person and her neighborhood, she were to take precautions, there would be no error,
though her relatives might still speak against her.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around. Going ahead brings
misfortune. If it has not yet touched one's own body but has reached one's neighbor first,
there is no blame. One's comrades have something to talk about.

Blofeld: Thunder brings disorder and people stare about them in terror. Advancing at
this time brings misfortune. The thunder affects not ourselves but our neighbors -- no
error. [We are not to blame for the trouble afflicting them; but, as the commentary on
this line indicates, they may think we are to blame and plan reprisals.] A marriage causes
gossip.

Liu: Thunder causes trembling and frightened looks. Undertaking -- misfortune. It will
not threaten your own body, but it might your neighbor. No blame. There will be gossip
about marriage.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shake: twining, twining. Observing: terrorizing, terrorizing.
Chastising: pitfall. Shake: not tending-towards one's body, tending-towards one's neighbor.
Without fault. Matrimonial allying possesses words.

Shaughnessy: Thunder is so clapping; looking so scared; to be upright is inauspicious.
Thunder is not in his body, but in his neighbor; in going there is no trouble. In confused
slander there is talk.

Cleary (1): Movement uneasy, gaze unsteady – an expedition will bring misfortune. The
action is not in oneself but in the neighbors; there is no blame. Association involves
criticism.

Cleary (2): Thunder is faint; the look is shifty. An expedition leads to misfortune.
The thunder does not reach you, but is in the vicinity. There is no blame. Association
involves criticism.

Wu: He is wavering in mind and looking anxiously right and left. It will be foreboding to
have undertakings. If he can prepare himself well, he will not be affected by the
thunderclap that impinges on his neighbor. However, he will be criticized for initiating
marriage.
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Amid the startling movements she has not found out the course of the
due mean. Though evil threatens, she will not fall into error. She is afraid of being warned
by her neighbors. Wilhelm/Baynes: He has not attained the middle. Misfortune, but no
blame. One is warned by the fear for one's neighbor. Blofeld: That thunder brings
disorder is indicated by the failure of the middle line of the upper trigram to win
supremacy over this top line. Although misfortune arises, we are not to blame. Fear of our
neighbors makes us cautious. Ritsema/Karcher: Center not-yet acquired indeed.
Although a pitfall, without fault. Dreading the neighbor, a warning indeed. Cleary (2):
The thunder is faint – balance has not been attained. Though there is misfortune, there is
no blame. Fear nearby is a warning. Wu: “He is wavering,” because he lacks self-
confidence. Despite the perilous situation, he will be free from error if he can learn a
lesson from his neighbor.

Legge: Line six is magnetic, and must abide the concluding terrors of the movement.
Action on her part is sure to be evil. If she were to take precautions, she might escape with
only the censure of her relatives.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man has not yet found a moderate course of behavior. He is dismayed at the
startling events of the times. Action will lead only to evil under such conditions. He should
withdraw, taking appropriate precautions, before the shock has affected him personally.
His associates may speak against him, but he should not be concerned.

Wing: The times are full of Shocking occurrences which bring disorder to all of society.
You cannot combat the times alone, and all those affected are too confused to react
appropriately. Retreat is the best course, although it may bring criticism from others who
do not comprehend your actions.

Anthony: We must not let shocking events cause us to vilify the Sage, Fate, God, or the
people who have wronged us. Shock brings an end to the old, but also a beginning to the
new, even though we encounter many dangers to get there. Meanwhile, we must withdraw
from the negative effects of shock.

Wu: If he can learn from the experience of his neighbor and rectify his personal life, he
will greatly lessen his losses.

Editor: The "neighbor” in the warning is the fifth line, described as coping with shock
reasonably well, though unable, as ruler, to hold the entire hexagram together. Line six is
advised to learn from her observation of line five's troubles to remain calm and stationary,
out of the fray. In other words, by analyzing the adversity of others, one can avoid making
their mistakes. Another way of conveying the same idea is to regard the "relative” who
might "speak against” line six as the third line correlate who is forced by her
circumstances to take action: because of this, line three is unable to understand why line
six cannot support her. The clear message here is one of adopting an unconventional or
51-- Shock/Thunder -- 51

independent point of view: survival now depends on not following the crowd. Blofeld, Liu,
Ritsema/Karcher and Wu are the only translators who mention "gossip about marriage."
Psychologically interpreted, this can mean stress connected with any synthesis of thought
and feeling -- perhaps a new attitude or belief. If this is the only changing line, the new
hexagram becomes number twenty-one, Discernment, giving a hint that cold-blooded,
dispassionate analysis is the best way to cope with a tricky situation.

The devastating impact of this fire can free the mind from its fetters and open the
way that leads to the center; but if the conscious mind is not prepared, not
strongly built on firm foundations, it may end in catastrophe. In psychological
terms the outcome will be dissociation, the division of the mind against itself.
A. Douglas -- The Tarot

A. Forewarned is forearmed. Never act when confused. Differentiate the
components of the situation, center your thinking, then act in your own best interests.

B. Despite contrary input (psychological or social), observation, experience and/or
common sense counsel self-protection.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-TWO --
KEEPING STILL

Other titles: Mountain, Keeping Still, The Symbol of Checking and Stopping, Desisting,
Stilling, Stillness, Stoppage, Bound, Reposing, Resting, Meditation, Non-action, Stopping,
Arresting Movement, "Refers to meditation and yoga." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: When his repose is like the back, and he loses all consciousness of self; when
he walks in his courtyard and does not see the people, there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping Still. Keeping his back still so that he no longer feels his
body. He goes into his courtyard and does not see his people. No blame.

Blofeld: Keeping the back so still as to seem virtually bodiless, or walking in the
courtyard without noticing the people there involves no error!

Liu: Stillness. Keeping the back still -- one feels that the body no longer exists. Even
when one walks in the courtyard, one sees no people. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's back. Not catching one's individuality. Moving one's
chambers. Not visualizing one's people. Without fault. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of confronting a boundary or obstacle. It emphasizes that stopping
and acknowledging the limit, the action of Bound, is the adequate way to handle it. To be
in accord with the time, you are told to stop!]

Shaughnessy: Stilling his back, but not stilling his body: Walking into his courtyard,
but not seeing his person; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Stopping at the back, one does not have a body; walking in the garden,
one does not see a person. No fault.

Cleary (2): Stilling the back, one does not find the body, etc.

Wu: Stoppage indicates that, resting on his back, he does not find his body and walking
in his courtyard, he does not see any person. Faultless.

Legge: The image of one mountain atop another forms Keeping Still. The superior
man, in accordance with this, does not allow his thoughts to go beyond the duties of his
immediate circumstances.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Mountains standing close together: the image of Keeping Still..
Thus the superior man does not permit his thoughts to go beyond his situation.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes two mountains conjoined. The Superior Man
takes thought in order to avoid having to move from his position.

Liu: Mountain next to mountain symbolizes stillness. The superior man's thoughts do
not go beyond his position.

Ritsema/Karcher: Joined mountains. Bound. A chun tzu uses pondering not to issue-
forth-from one's situation.

Cleary (1): Joining mountains. Thus do superior people think without leaving their
place.

Cleary (2): The mountains are still. Thus the thoughts of developed people are not
out of place.

Wu: One mountain overlapping another makes Stoppage. Thus the jun zi does not
contemplate things beyond his position. [Confucius said: “If you do not hold an office, do
not give counsels on its administration.” What he meant is: not to volunteer counsels
freely. On the other hand, if you are requested, then give the best you can.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Keeping Still means stopping: One rests when it is time to rest, and
acts when it is time to act. When action and rest occur at the proper times, one's behavior
is enlightened. Keeping his back still, he rests in his proper place. The upper and lower
lines of the hexagram all mirror each other, but are without any interaction: Hence it is
said that he has no consciousness of [ego]. He does not see the persons in his courtyard,
and there will be no error.

Legge: Two trigrams symbolizing Mountain make up the hexagram of Keeping Still.
Mountains rise up grandly from the surface of the earth, their huge masses resting on it in
quiet and solemn majesty. They are barriers to the onward progress of the traveler. The
attributes of this hexagram are both resting and arresting. It denotes the characteristic of
resting in what is right in principle, right on the widest possible scale -- in the absolute
conception of the mind and in every possible position in which a man can be placed. As in
hexagram number thirty-one, Initiative, the symbolism is taken from the different parts
of the human body.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

According to the K'ang-hsi editors, the second sentence in the Image should be
translated: "The superior man, in consequence with this, thinks anxiously how he shall
not go beyond the duties of his position."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: "Wipe out imagination: check desire: extinguish appetite: keep the ruling
faculty in its own power.” -- Marcus Aurelius

The Superior Man eliminates all distraction and concentrates on the matter at hand.

A large portion of the Work consists of nothing more than the will to keep still.
Anyone who has ever tried it can attest that Keeping Still, or doing “nothing,” is
probably the most difficult thing that a human can be asked to do. We are an ever-flowing
fountain of restless desire -- the senses are mindlessly programmed to encounter their
objects, and when we prevent them from doing this, a great commotion occurs in the
psyche. We are so accustomed to feeling our desires, drives, instincts and appetites as
integral to our awareness, that we are seldom conscious of the fact that they are actually
autonomous forces -- as separate from the ego, or choice-making complex, as we are from
other people, creatures or objects in the physical world. Try controlling an ingrained habit,
such as smoking, and observe how difficult it is to impose your will upon it. Who controls
whom?

The power of sight does not come from the eye, the power to hear does not come
from the ear, nor the power to feel from the nerves; but it is the spirit of man that
sees through the eye, and hears with the ear, and feels by means of the nerves.
Wisdom and reason and thought are not contained in the brain, but they belong to
the invisible and universal spirit which feels through the heart and thinks by
means of the brain. All these powers are contained in the invisible universe, and
become manifest through material organs, and the material organs are their
representatives, and modify their mode of manifestation according to their
material construction, because a perfect manifestation of power can only take
place in a perfectly constructed organ, and if the organ is faulty, the
manifestation will be imperfect, but not the original power defective.
Paracelsus -- De Viribus Membrorum

The ego has only one legitimate function -- to make choices: it is the switchboard in
the psyche which directs where the energy of the instinctual powers shall go. If these
autonomous forces are stronger than the will of the ego, they soon learn to get their way as
often as possible. The main difference between an inferior and a superior man is that the
latter has learned to control and direct his energies for a higher purpose. One of the best
ways to acquire this ability is to learn the lessons inherent within Keeping Still.

Psychoanalysis has demonstrated that the power of these images and complexes
lies chiefly in the fact that we are unconscious of them, that we do not recognize
them as such. When they are unmasked, understood, and resolved into their

52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

elements, they often cease to obsess us; in any case we are then much better able
to defend ourselves against them.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

The lines of the upper and lower trigrams are mirror images of each other, yet not
one of them has a proper correlate: they don't connect with each other. This suggests the
separation of the senses from their objects. For example, eyeballs are sensory-receptors
designed for the perception of light and form -- close your eyes, and they are prevented
from contacting the phenomena they were created to perceive. That the psychic entities
attached to this desire to perceive phenomena might resist restriction is a foregone
conclusion, but the ego has control over the eyelids -- or should have. “Not seeing the
people in one's own courtyard” means that one ignores one's autonomous impulses.

Regulation of the psyche’s autonomous manifestations in accordance with the will
of the Self is for the purpose of gaining a controlling influence over one’s karma. As stated
herein many times, you, as ego, are nothing more than a tool created by the Self for the
direction of its own destiny.

Both karma theory and quantum mechanics refuse to accept that observers can
exist independent of the systems they observe. Spiritual science goes so far as to
take the observer’s own internal universe and its states as its experimental field.
For it is within that field that karma is produced and stored ...The “matter” from
which we and our obstructions are created includes both the dense physical
material from which our bodies are built and the thoughts, attitudes and emotions
that make up our minds. Tantric practice is karmic engineering within this field of
name and form, orchestration of substance and action into result. First you direct
new causes against previous effects to nullify adverse influences on your
awareness, then you unleash yet further actions to negate the influence of the
nullifying actions.
Robert Svoboda –Aghora III, The Law of Karma

How any ego could tackle such responsibilities with any hope of progress is
impossible to imagine without the direction of the Self. Keeping Still certainly has its
own karmic consequences, but when the “not choosing” implied in this hexagram is done
in accordance with the Self’s will and intent, the results slowly lead to ever higher levels of
awareness – eventually into realms beyond the physical. That is what the Work is all
about: any other choice is to lock ourselves into a continuous round of birth and death in
physical manifestation.

The Kabbalists teach that everything we do stirs up a corresponding energy in
other realms of reality. Actions, words, or thoughts set up reverberations in the
universe. The universe unfolds from moment to moment as a function of all the
variables leading up to that moment. When we remain cognizant of this mystical
system, we are careful about what we do, say, or even think, for we know that
everything is interdependent; we know that a seemingly insignificant gesture
could have weighty consequences.
Rabbi David Cooper – God is a Verb

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Notice that every line of this hexagram except the last deals with an inherent
challenge involved in the discipline required to keep still. Compare the lines in Keeping
Still with similar lines in hexagram 31, Initiative.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping her toes at rest. There will
be no error, but it will be advantageous for her to be persistently firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping his toes still. No blame. Continued perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Stilling the toes -- no error. Unwavering persistence in a righteous course brings
advantage. [This suggests the simplest kind of stillness, namely staying where we are.]

Liu: Keeping the toes still. No error. Continued persistence is advantageous.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's feet. Without fault. Harvesting: perpetual Trial.

Shaughnessy: Stilling his foot: there is no trouble; beneficial for permanent
determination.

Cleary (1): Stopping at the feet, there is no fault. It is beneficial to be always upright.

Wu: He rests his toes. No error. It is advantageous to be persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She does not fail in what is correct according to the idea of the figure.
Wilhelm/Baynes: What is right is not yet lost. Blofeld: This passage is implied by the
position of this line, which is not out of order. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet letting-go
correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Stop the feet before losing correctness. Wu: He has not
lost the correct way.

Legge: The symbolism of the hexagram rises from one part of the body to the other. The
first line at the bottom of the figure fitly suggests the toes. Toes play a great part in
walking, but there are here at rest, and so do not lose the correct idea of Keeping Still.
The lesson is that from the first men should rest in and be anxious to do what is right in all
their affairs. The dynamic line in a magnetic place accounts for the caution with which the
phrase concludes.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man pauses to study the situation as it actually exists -- without
being led astray by wishful thinking or ulterior motives. He must remain persistently firm
and correct to avoid irresolute drifting.

Wing: Because the situation is only at its beginning, you are able to see things as they are.
Furthermore, your interests and motives have not yet become self-serving. Continuing in
this objective attitude is necessary for advancement.

Editor: The I Ching consistently uses the image of toes as symbolic of initial movement -

    the beginning of some kind of action. Here the message is to refrain from action. There
    is a hint that egotistical compulsiveness or impatience might
    be involved. You are counseled to squelch this urge and remain quietly in place.

Our vitality constantly drives us to do something and if we stop that, something
within us keeps going on. Try once to think of nothing even for half a second! You
cannot! You think: "Gosh, I have to go to the butcher, etc." It is the constant
autonomous restlessness of the life we lead and our will-power is insufficient to
enable a simple inner life to overcome that autonomous liveliness. With the help of
the Self, however, it comes forth.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. Do not initiate action.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping the calves of her legs at rest.
She cannot help the subject of the line above whom she follows, and is dissatisfied in her
mind.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping his calves still. He cannot rescue him whom he follows. His
heart is not glad.

Blofeld: Stilling the calves. His heart is sad because he is unable to save his followers.
[Perhaps the implication is that the mind's injunction to be still reached the calves but
was delayed there, so that the feet continued moving until it was too late. In other words,
we are too late in deciding to stay where we are, although circumstances make this most
desirable.]

Liu: Keeping the calves still. But he cannot restrain the movements that follow, and he is
uneasy in his mind. [A person cannot achieve his goal now.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's calves. Not rescuing one's following. One's heart not
keen.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

Shaughnessy: Stilling his calves: not raising aloft his rent flesh, his heart is not glad.

Cleary (1): Stopping at the calves doesn’t help out the following. The heart is unhappy.

Cleary (2): Stopping the calves, they don’t rise to follow. The mind is not happy.

Wu: He rests the calves of his legs. He cannot help the one he follows and feels unhappy.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He whom she follows will not retreat to listen to her.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Because this one does not turn toward him to listen to him. Blofeld:
He cannot save them because he failed to retire and wait. Ritsema/ Karcher: Not-yet
withdrawing-from hearkening indeed. Cleary (2): Not rising to follow means not
retreating to listen. Wu: Because that person is unwilling to step back and listen to him.

Legge: Above the toes are the calves, represented by the second line which is magnetic
but in its proper place. Above this again, are the loins, represented by the third line --
dynamic and in danger of being violent. The second line follows the third and would like
to help him, but is unable to do so because there is no correlation between them. The third
line will persist in his course without heeding the warnings of line two.

Anthony: Keeping his calves still. When we allow ourself to be lured by a wrong motive,
it means we doubt that the correct way will work. When doubt pervades, we should not act.
“He cannot rescue him whom he follows.” If our inner eye is fastened on what another
person does, we follow their path rather than our own. We can only rescue them if we
follow our own path. When they see that they are truly alone, with no one to rescue them,
they will try to save themselves.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is unable to stop his stronger master even when the latter is bent on the
direction of wrongdoing. He is unhappy about being swept along by such a movement.

Wing: You are swept along by your goals and the events you've set into motion. Even
though you may wish to stop and reconsider, you cannot halt the flow of action. This
condition brings unhappiness.

Editor: The image depicts one bound to a force or situation which one either can't or
won't control. Ritsema/Karcher translate "hearkening” in the Confucian commentary as:
“T'ING: ...The ideogram ear and actualizing-tao, hear and obey.” Perhaps you have
disregarded your intuition or inner voice: the Self. In some contexts, the image suggests
one disempowered by circumstances not of one’s own making. Little or nothing can be
done to influence the situation.

If you have given way to anger, be sure that over and above the evil involved
therein, you have strengthened the habit, and added fuel to the fire. If overcome

52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

by a temptation of the flesh, do not reckon it a single defeat, but that you have also
strengthened your dissolute habits. Habits and faculties are necessarily affected
by the corresponding acts. Those that were not there before, spring up: the rest
gain in strength and extent.
Epictetus

A. Depicts a powerless relationship with a controlling inferior force.

B. Fight hard against your "need" to act.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject keeping his loins at rest, and
separating the ribs from the body below. The situation is perilous, and the heart glows
with suppressed excitement.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping his hips still. Making his sacrum stiff. Dangerous. The
heart suffocates.

Blofeld: Stilling the loins and stiffening the spine – his heart is suffocated by trouble.
[Elsewhere in the Book of Change, it is made clear that the loins sometimes symbolize
sexual desire. To force oneself to continence when the mind is not ready for it is
exceedingly dangerous and may lead to mental and emotional disarrangement. What is
required is stilling the WHOLE self, a cessation of desire itself.]

Liu: Keeping the loins and the middle of the spine still. Danger. His heart is like an
anxious flame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's limit. Assigned-to one's loins: adversity smothers the
heart.

Shaughnessy: Stilling his midsection: scratching his spine; danger; smoke the heart.

Cleary (1): Stopping at the waist breaks the backbone; danger inflames the heart.

Wu: He rests his waist and tightens it with a waistband. He is deeply worried.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The danger of keeping the loins at rest produces a glowing heat in the
heart. Wilhelm/Baynes: There is danger that the heart may suffocate. Blofeld: If the
loins are stilled, there is a danger that the heart will suffocate. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Exposure smothers the heart indeed. Cleary (2): Danger affects the heart. Wu: He is
deeply worried.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

Legge: When the calves are kept at rest, advance is stopped, but no other harm ensues.
Not so when the loins are kept at rest, and unable to bend, for the connection between the
upper and lower parts of the body is then broken. The dissatisfaction increases to an
angry heat. Canon McClatchie suggests the idea of "stopping at a limit, and separating
what is in continued succession (i.e., the backbone); thus the mind, etc."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Danger results from the smoldering resentment against forced inaction on the part of
the man. The proper frame of mind for meditation and concentration can arise naturally
only out of inner composure and not through artificial rigidity.

Wing: If you attempt to force stillness upon restless desires you will only create deep
inner conflict and resentment. This can be dangerous. Attempt internal composure
through relaxation and Meditation.

Editor: If the heart is the point of balance between the dry speculations of the brain and
the robust libido of the genitals ("loins"), then the will to keep the loins at rest is certain to
create a conflict within the psyche which will test our "heart" to serve the higher ideals of
the Work. As the top line of the lower trigram, this is a place of transition between a lower
and higher condition, and the imagery describes the conflict which ensues whenever one
undertakes such a separation. Blofeld's note about sexuality is very apt here: the Self is
capable of testing one's will to the very limits of endurance on this issue; indeed, control of
sexual libido is one of the cornerstones of the Work and cannot be evaded. The concept of
the "cessation of desire itself" is easily understood, yet all but impossible to achieve. If this
is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes number 23, Disintegration
(Splitting Apart), the corresponding line of which offers a strong hint about how to
handle the situation at hand.

For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these
are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
Galatians 5: 17

A. Make a distinction between your will and your desire, and at least be conscious
about which one you choose.

B. Enforced inaction is suffocating to a free spirit.

C. Calm down -- get back on center. Disassociate yourself from an inferior force.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping her trunk at rest. There will
be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping his trunk still. No blame.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

Blofeld: Stilling the body -- no error!

Liu: Keeping the body still. No error.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's individuality. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Stilling his torso.

Cleary (1): Stopping at the body, there is no blame.

Cleary (2): Stopping at the torso, there is no fault.

Wu: He rests on his body. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She keeps herself free from agitation. Wilhelm/Baynes: He stops
within his own body. Blofeld: Stilling the body means stilling the whole self. Ritsema/
Karcher: Stopping connoting the body indeed. Cleary (2): Stopping the torso stills the
body. Wu: This means he puts a stop at his own person.

Legge: Each part of the body, such as the mouth, eyes and ears has its own particular
appetite which draws it to that which is outside of itself. The back alone has nothing to do
with anything beyond itself -- hardly with itself even. All that it has to do is stand straight
and strong. So should it be with us, resting in principle, free from the intrusion of selfish
thoughts and external objects.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man forgets his ego. This leads to the highest state of rest.

Wing: Your frame of mind is conducive to self-mastery. You have only to transcend the
impulses of your ego to achieve the ideal of Meditation.

Editor: Siu's paraphrase combined with Legge's commentary, implies that the situation
requires total non-action in the physical, emotional and mental realms of the psyche. This
of course is the ideal of almost all forms of meditation.

If, in experiencing an emotion -- any emotion -- a person consciously refrains
from acting on it while at the same time keeping the event alive within himself, he
will discover that the emotion leads him to another dimension of experience. He
will discover that the energy of the emotion does not die because of his refusal to
give it a space outside of himself. If he holds on to the tail of this tiger as it
rebounds inward, he will discover its source. He will then learn why the
mediaeval alchemists and Kabbalists insisted that man contains within him a sun,

52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

a center of pure energy. It should be stressed that the method I am talking about
here is nothing new. The idea is implicit in all Oriental yogas.
C. Ponce -- Kabbalah

A. Non-action is correct action. Maintain repose.

B. Meditate.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject keeping her jawbones at rest, so that her
words are all orderly. Occasion for repentance will disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Keeping his jaws still. The words have order. Remorse disappears.

Blofeld: Stilling the jaws. Since his words are well ordered, he ceases to have cause for
regret.

Liu: Keeping the jaws still. His speech has order. Remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bound: one's jawbones. Words possessing sequence. Repenting
extinguished.

Shaughnessy: Stilling his cheeks: words have sequence; regret is gone.

Cleary (2): Stopping the jaws, there is order in speech, and regret vanishes.

Wu: He rests his lower jaw. He speaks with orderliness. Regret vanishes.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She acts correctly in harmony with her central position. Wilhelm/
Baynes: As a result of central and correct behavior. Blofeld: This is indicated by the
suitable position of this line, which is central to the upper trigram. Ritsema/Karcher:
Using centering correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Stopping the jaws is done with balance
and uprightness. Wu: Because of his central position.

Legge: The place of the magnetic fifth line is not proper for it, hence the mention of her
repenting. Yu Pen (Ming dynasty) says on line five: "Words should not be uttered rashly.
Then, when uttered, they will accord with principle. But it is only the master of the virtue
of the due mean who can attain to this."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is judicious in his choice of words. He thereby eliminates occasions for
regret.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

Wing: Once you have centered yourself, your words will be chosen more carefully, and
outspoken or unthinking comments will be avoided. In this way you will no longer suffer
shame or regret.

Editor: At its most obvious level, to keep the jawbones at rest is to refrain from ill-
considered remarks. But what if one receives this line in a context where speech, per se, is
not a factor? Speech is the utterance of words, and words express ideas. As artifacts of the
mental realm, words are the components of conceptualization. All of the translations
emphasize the idea of bringing order to one's words, hence the line in its larger context is
an injunction to sort out the facts of the matter at hand and arrange them in a meaningful
pattern. It can refer to re-thinking a situation, or sometimes just to the need to shut off
your constant inner chatter. Ritsema/Karcher's Confucian commentary uses the term
"Centering correcting," which they translate as: "Make rectifying one-sidedness and error
your central concern; reaching a stable center in yourself can correct the situation."

It is very difficult for a man to keep silent about things that interest him. He
would like to speak about them to everyone with whom he is accustomed to share
his thoughts ... This is the most mechanical of all desires and in this case silence is
the most difficult abstinence of all. But if a man understands this or, at least, if he
follows this rule, it will constitute for him the best exercise possible for self-
remembering and for the development of will. Only a man who can be silent when
it is necessary can be master of himself.
Gurdjieff

A. Bring order to your thinking. Thought structures can become barriers to correct
perception -- don't jump to simplistic conclusions.

B. "Make sure brain is engaged before putting mouth in gear."

C. When you don't understand what's happening, refrain from useless speculation.

Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject devotedly maintaining his restfulness.
There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Noble hearted keeping still. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The highest form of stillness -- good fortune!

Liu: Keeping still with benevolence. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Magnanimous Bounding, significant.

Shaughnessy: Thick roots; auspicious.
52 -- Keeping Still -- 52

Cleary (2): Careful stopping is auspicious.

Wu: He rests with honor. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: To the end he shows himself generous and good. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The good fortune of noble hearted keeping still comes from the fact that there is
an ample end. Blofeld: He achieves this in order to win greater benefit in the end.
Ritsema/Karcher: Using munificence to complete indeed. Cleary (2): A rich
conclusion. Wu: It ends with honor.

Legge: The third line of the trigrams, and the sixth line of the hexagram, is what makes
Keeping Still what it is -- the symbol of a mountain. The subject of it therefore will carry
out the resting required by the whole figure in the highest style.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attains tranquility in relation to life in its entirety.

Wing: When your inner composure can reach even beyond the situation into all aspects of
your life, you can penetrate the true meaning of things. From this perspective comes great
good fortune.

Editor: The sixth line suggests the very top of the mountain -- the peak which is nearest
to heaven and hence most in conformance with the ideals of the hexagram of Keeping
Still.

If meditation is controlled thinking, it implies that the individual has the entire
thought process under control, including input from the subconscious. The
experienced meditator learns how to think what he wants to think, when he wants
to think it. He can always be in control of the situation, resisting psychological
pressures that work on the subconscious. He is also in control of himself, never
doing something that he knows he really does not want to do. In many schools,
this self-mastery is one of the most important goals of meditation.
Aryeh Kaplan -- Jewish Meditation

A. An image of tranquil non-action.

B. Present inaction creates future advantage.

53 -- Gradual Progress-53
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-THREE --
GRADUAL PROGRESS

Other titles: Development, The Symbol of Progressive Advance, Gradual Development,
Infiltrating, Advancing, Growth, Developing, Gradualness, Dialectical Progression, Step by
Step, "The slower the stronger." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Gradual Progress shows the good fortune attending the marriage of a young
lady. Firm correctness brings advantage.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Development. The maiden is given in marriage. Good fortune.
Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Gradual Progress. The marriage of a maiden brings good fortune.
Persistence in a righteous course brings reward.

Liu: Gradual Development. The marriage of a girl -- Good Fortune. It benefits to
continue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Infiltrating, womanhood converting significant. Harvesting Trial.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of gradually achieving a goal. It
emphasizes that advancing through diffuse but steady penetration is the adequate way
to handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: infiltrate!]

Shaughnessy: Advancing: For the maiden to return is auspicious; beneficial to
determine.

Cleary (2): Gradual Progress in a woman’s marriage is auspicious. It is beneficial to
be chaste.

Wu: Gradualness indicates that it is auspicious for a woman to get married and it is
advantageous for her to be persevering.

The Image

Legge: A tree on the mountain -- the image of Gradual Progress. The superior man
attains and nourishes his extraordinary virtue to improve the manners of the people.

Wilhelm/Baynes: On the mountain, a tree: the image of Development. Thus the
superior man abides in dignity and virtue, in order to improve the mores.
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a tree upon a mountain. The Superior Man, abiding
in holiness and virtue, inclines the people towards goodness.

Liu: A tree on the mountain symbolizes Gradual Development. The superior man, in
maintaining his virtue, improves society's customs.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above mountain possessing wood. Infiltrating. A chun tzu uses
residing-in eminent actualizing-tao to improve the vulgar. [Actualize-tao: Ability to
follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the cosmos ... Linked with acquire, TE:
acquiring that which makes a being become what it is meant to be.]

Cleary (1): There are trees on the mountain, growing gradually. Thus do superior
people abide in sagacity and improve customs.

Cleary (2): ...Developed people improve customs by living wisely and virtuously.

Wu: There are trees on the mountain; this is Gradualness. The jun zi chooses to live in
the neighborhood known for its high moral standards and exemplary custom.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The ascent of Gradual Progress resembles the fortunate marriage
of a young lady. The lines ascend to their proper places, indicating achievement. Because
the ascent is made correctly the subject of the hexagram is empowered to rectify his
country. He is shown as the dynamic ruler in line five, central and correct. The
alternation of Keeping Still and Flexible Penetration ensure that the advance is continuous.

Legge: The written character for Gradual Progress is ordinarily used in the sense of
gradually, but there is connected with it also the idea of advance. The whole of it
denotes a gradual advance like the soaking in of water. The other two hexagrams that
contain the idea of advance are number thirty-five, Advance of Consciousness and
number forty-six, Pushing Upward -- each expresses its own nuance of meaning, and
here the nuance is the gradual manner in which the advance takes place.

The theme of the hexagram is the advance of men to offices in the state -- how it
should take place gradually and by successive steps. Lines 2, 3, 4 and 5 are all in their
proper places as dynamic or magnetic, and we ascend them as by regular steps to the top
of the hexagram.

The marriage of a young lady illustrates an important event which takes place
according to various preliminary steps which must be correctly done in an orderly
sequence. So must it be with the advance of a man in the service of the state.

The K'ang-hsi editors say: "A tree springing up on the ground is a tree as it begins
to grow. A tree on a hill is high and large. Every tree when it begins to grow shows its
branches and twigs gradually becoming long. Every morning and every evening show
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

some difference; and when the tree is high and great, whether it be of an ordinary or
extraordinary size, it has taken years to reach its dimensions."

Added Commentary: Blofeld appends the following footnote to each line in this
hexagram: it is easier to read it here as his general commentary. [The additional Chinese
commentaries explain that the wild goose is a bird which moves toward the sun. Now, a
commonly used Chinese term for the sun is YANG, namely the male principle. So the bird
obviously (sic) betokens a maiden seeking a husband. Its movement from river bank to
rock, dry land, a tree, a hillock and the mainland (which is said in one commentary to
mean peninsula) signifies gradual movement in an unchanging direction. From the point
of view of divination, this is the best course for us, even if marriage is not our objective.
Regarding marriage: the first line betokens gossip, although the marriage is not
unsuitable; the second, a materially successful marriage; the third, an unfortunate
marriage; the fourth, marriage to someone exceedingly kind and thoughtful; the fifth, a
blissful marriage; the sixth, marriage to a public figure who has some responsibility for
good order within the realm and who succeeds in his task.]

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: The proper union of forces within the psyche is a matter of slow maturation.

The Superior Man maintains his will and transforms the psyche. "Example is the
school of mankind, and they will learn at no other." -- Burke

This is one of the most hierarchical of the hexagrams -- each line represents a clear
advance from the position of the preceding line, thus giving an image of Gradual
Progress. The vehicle of this progression is the wild goose, which also appears in every
line. A goose is a bird -- primarily a creature of the air, or realm of thought; but because it
also thrives on either water or land, the goose symbolizes thought which permeates the
lower two categories of consciousness -- emotion (water), and sensation (earth).

Another traditional interpretation of the goose motif is that of the universal aspect
of the soul. The wild goose is able to move about everywhere, on firm land, in
water and in the air. It is the bird of Hermes, who is the leader of souls.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

The progress of the goose is a gradual one, from the shore, or threshold of
awareness in line one, to the mountain heights, or realm of the Spirit in line six. The fact
that this progress is linked with the idea of marriage in the Judgment is a clear hint that
we are dealing here with the idea of the union of opposites within the psyche. (See
commentary on hexagram number eleven.) The message is unambiguous: the process of
psycho-spiritual growth is one of slow maturation. There are no short-cuts to
enlightenment.

Evils and falsities must be removed, to the intent that a new life which is the life of
heaven may be implanted. This can in nowise be done hastily; for every evil
enrooted with its falsities has connection with all evils and their falsities; and

53 -- Gradual Progress-53

such evils and falsities are innumerable, and their connection is so manifold that
it cannot be comprehended ... From this it is plain that the life of hell in man
cannot be suddenly destroyed, for if it were suddenly done he would straightway
expire; and that the life of heaven cannot be suddenly implanted, for if this were
done suddenly he would also expire.
Swedenborg -- Arcana Coelestia

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows the wild geese gradually approaching the shore. A
young officer in similar circumstances will be in a position of danger, and be spoken
against; but there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the shore. The young son is
in danger. There is talk. No blame.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards the river bank. The younger son is in
trouble. There is talk, but no error.

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches the shore. The boy is in danger. There is gossip.
No blame. [This line indicates difficulty, but you will ultimately be able to achieve your
undertaking.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the barrier. The small
son, adversity possessing words. Lacking fault.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the depths; for the little son dangerous; there
are words; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed on the shoreline. The small ones are in danger; there
is criticism, no fault.

Cleary (2): Geese gradually proceed to the shoreline. If humble people are diligent and
speak up, there is no blame.

Wu: The wild goose flies in gradually to rest by the riverbank. The little fellow is in
jeopardy and he is being talked about, but without fault.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The danger is owing to no fault of hers in the matter of what is right.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The danger besetting the little son implies no blame. Blofeld: `The
younger son is in trouble' is just a way of saying that there is trouble for which we are not
to blame. Ritsema/Karcher: Righteous, without fault indeed. Cleary (2): The
diligence of humble people is dutiful and blameless. Wu: In principle he is faultless.
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Legge: In line one the geese appear for the first time in the season approaching the shore.
Then comes the real subject of the line -- she is magnetic in a dynamic place and without a
proper correlate above. The difficulty and danger of her situation are seen as the result of
circumstances -- the young officer has not brought it on herself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the young man begins to make his way in the world. He is subjected to
criticisms because his inexperienced steps are slow and hesitant. These will help prevent
future errors on his part.

Wing: Your position is one of the classic beginner. Criticism is now unavoidable, however
-- it can be used to your advantage in refining your skills. You can lay down the early
foundations for later successes.

Editor: Air (thought) is more abstract than water (emotion); water is more abstract than
earth (sensation). Of the three elements, earth is the most solid and the shore is where
they all meet. As a creature at home in air, water or on land, the goose symbolizes a force
which grounds an abstraction where it can be seen, grasped and understood. The young
officer is inexperienced awareness coping with a new situation. "Danger" and being
"spoken against" suggest confusion and conflicting emotions within the psyche as one
deals with something new and unfamiliar. Remembering that the symbol of marriage in
the Judgment relates to the union of thought and feeling within our physical vehicle, we
can see that this first line represents a new synthesis of some sort.

It is the firmness, the effort and the skillfulness of the conscious ego's position that
finally decide whether the onrush from the deep will bring about chaos and
meaningless suffering or whether the suffering can instead provide the dark
background from which the light of a new order may arise.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Expect confusion and difficulty in coping with a developing situation.

B. Inexperience with new concepts necessitates careful differentiation of all the
factors involved.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the geese gradually approaching the large rocks,
where they eat and drink joyfully and at ease. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff. Eating and drinking in
peace and concord. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards the rock. Eating and drinking happily -

    good fortune.

53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches a big rock. It eats and drinks joyfully. Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the stone. Drinking and
taking-in: feasting, feasting. Significant.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the slope: wine and food so overflowing;
auspicious.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed on boulders; they eat and drink happily. Good
fortune.

Cleary (2): Geese gradually proceed onto a boulder; etc. This is auspicious.

Wu: The wild goose flies in gradually to rest on a big rock. There is joy in eating and
drinking. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: They eat and drink joyfully, but not without having earned their food.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He does not merely eat his fill. Blofeld: Good fortune in the form of
delicate and plentiful food. Ritsema/Karcher: Not sheer satiation indeed. Cleary (2):
They don’t just stuff themselves idly. Wu: Not for the sake of gluttony.

Legge: The geese have advanced in line two, and so has the officer, though she is not
mentioned. Line two is magnetic, humble and central, and has a proper correlate in the
fifth line. Hence the good auspice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man soon overcomes his initial insecurity. He acquires a good position, earns a
reasonable livelihood, and enjoys the company of his comrades.

Wing: You are in a secure position. The activities that lie on the road ahead will further
consolidate your development. You may feel free to share your good fortune and security
with others.

Editor: The first line describes confusion as a new situation begins to develop; line
two suggests that this new force has established a beachhead and now consolidates
(nourishes) itself for further advancement.

Without the development of the ego and its discipline, the growth of modern
thought, modern science, modern technology would have been impossible. Man’s
intelligence has apparently not increased -- at all events, not during historical
times -- but his ability to govern and direct it has expanded enormously.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

53 -- Gradual Progress-53

A. The image depicts the consolidation of a position.

B. Nurture your new-won advantages.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows the geese gradually advanced to the dry plains. It
suggests also the idea of a husband who goes on an expedition from which he does not
return, and of a wife who is pregnant, but will not nourish her child. There will be evil.
The case symbolized might be advantageous in resisting plunderers.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau. The man goes forth
and does not return. The woman carries a child but does not bring it forth. Misfortune. It
furthers one to fight off robbers.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards the dry land. The husband goes forth
and does not return. The wife is pregnant, but the child's birth is delayed -- misfortune!
This is an auspicious time for chastising evil-doers.

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches the highland. The man sets out and does not
return. The woman is pregnant, but does not give birth. Misfortune. It is beneficial to
protect oneself from robbers. [Fearfulness and disharmony are indicated by this line.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the highlands. The
husband chastised, not returning. The wife pregnant, not nurturing. Pitfall. Harvesting:
resisting outlawry.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the land; The husband campaigns but
does not return, the wife is pregnant but does not give birth; inauspicious; beneficial
to have that which robs.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed on a plateau. The husband who goes on an
expedition does not return; the wife who gets pregnant does not raise the child. Misfortune.
It is beneficial to defend against brigands. [The misfortune comes about because in the use
of strength it is important to stop in the proper place and defend against brigands, not
act arbitrarily and become a brigand oneself. This is gradual progress in which one is
strong but loses control.]

Cleary (2): Geese gradually proceed onto high ground. Etc. It is beneficial to defend
against enemies.

Wu: The wild goose flies in gradually to rest on high ground. The husband joins active
military duty, but does not return; the wife is pregnant, but miscarries. Foreboding. Yet it
is advantageous to defend against the intruders. [The third nine is overly strong...he
wants to go alone and may have gotten lost or been captured.]
53 -- Gradual Progress-53
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The husband separates himself from his comrades. The wife has
failed in her proper course. By resisting thieves men would preserve one another.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He leaves the group of his companions. She has lost the right way.
Devotion and mutual protection. Blofeld: The husband's failure to return symbolizes
separation from our normal companions. Delayed childbirth symbolizes our going astray.
The final sentence indicates willingness to take precautions for mutual protection.
Ritsema/Karcher: Radiance flocking demons indeed. [Demon(iac), CH'OU:
possessed by a malignant genius; ugly, physically or morally deformed: vile, disgraceful,
shameful; drunken. The ideogram: fermenting liquor and soul...] Letting-go her tao
indeed. Yielding mutualizes protection indeed. Cleary (2): Leaving the group is
disgraceful. The wife...loses the way. Harmoniously protecting one another. Wu: He
separates from his comrades. She does not take the proper course. Because people would
unite to protect one another.

Legge: Line three is dynamic, has passed the central place to the top of the lower trigram,
and has no proper correlate in line six. He is likely to be violent and unsuccessful in his
movements. He is like a husband who deserts his wife, or a wife who neglects her child.
But in the case supposed, his strength in the end would be useful. "Separation from his
comrades” means he finds no correlate. The wife fails in her proper course because the
line is dynamic instead of magnetic, and has in addition passed the central position of
balance.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man goes too far and plunges into struggles beyond what is required by the
natural laws of development. He loses his way. His life and family are jeopardized. He will
regain his advantage if he does not provoke conflicts but uses his strength more in
guarding his own position in line with his available resources and capabilities.

Wing: If you provoke a conflict or make a bold and forceful advance, you will place
yourself and those close to you in danger. This is a foolish risk indeed. You would be much
wiser to allow things to develop naturally and, instead, secure what you have.

Editor: This is an image of an aborted synthesis: we see Gradual Progress halted and
dissipated in fruitless stagnation. Goose: Sensation and emotion under the influence of
thought. Dry Plains: Infertile prospects: an area of futile speculation or endeavor.
Wilhelm's rendering of "plateau" emphasizes a horizontal rather than vertical orientation -

    reinforcing the image of no increase, no progress. Husband and wife: Union of thought
    and feeling, intellect and emotion. Child: The product, the ongoing evolution of thought
    and feeling within the psyche. Plunderers: Divisive, disruptive elements which bring
    about the separation of what is united. This estrangement brings a halt to the progress of
    the Work. Ritsema/ Karcher’s “Radiance flocking demons indeed” can represent inner
    complexes, phobias, compulsions, etc. The best course is to re-organize and defend
    yourself against further loss. Siu’s paraphrase says it best.

53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Thus [the patient] is still in an undesirably passive condition where everything is
rather uncertain and questionable; neither he nor I know the journey's end. Often
it is not much more than a groping about in Egyptian darkness. In this condition
we must not expect any very startling results -- the uncertainty is too great for
that. Besides which there is always the risk that what we have woven by day the
night will unravel. The danger is that nothing is achieved, that nothing remains
fixed.
Jung -- The Practice of Psychotherapy

A. Image of a stalemate caused by unbalanced forces of some sort – perhaps a
severely limiting belief. Withdraw support from this indulgence!

B. Arid speculation abandons its foundation in basic reality. You waste your
energy on illusions – -- nothing will come of it.

C. Logos departs, Eros aborts -- defend the Work.

D. You’re blowing energy on a fruitless endeavor.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows the geese gradually advanced to the trees. They
may light on the flat branches. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the tree. Perhaps it will find a
flat branch. No blame.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards a tree and may find a suitable branch
on which to perch -- no error!

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches the tree, seeking a safe branch. No blame. [This
is a time of contentment in your personal life, without fear or sadness.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the trees. Maybe
acquiring one's rafter. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the tree: perhaps getting what the robbers
rejected; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed in the trees, and may reach a level roost. No fault.

Wu: The wild goose flies in gradually to rest in the wood. It may find a flat branch. No
error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There is docility in the line going on to flexible penetration.
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Wilhelm/Baynes: It is devoted and gentle. Blofeld: Its finding a suitable branch
augurs willing acceptance and gentleness. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding using Ground
indeed. Cleary (2): Following docilely. Wu: It may find a flat branch if the approach
is favorable.

Legge: The web-footed goose is not suited for taking hold on the branches, but on flat
branches it can rest. Line four is the first line in the upper trigram of Humility, and it is
concluded that she will not fall into error. Ch'eng-tzu says that humility and right-doing
will find rest and peace in all places and circumstances.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man attains a safe position through docility and pliancy.

Wing: You must remain flexible now. It may be necessary to sidestep difficulties, yield to
obstacles, or retreat from danger. These, of course, are only temporary measures. The
important thing is to maintain your safety now so that you can develop the conditions for
later successes.

Editor: The image suggests a temporary compromise.

But between the starting point in the lowlands of our ordinary consciousness and
the shining peak of Self- realization there are intermediate phases, plateaus at
various altitudes on which a man may rest or even make his abode, if his lack of
strength precludes or his will does not choose a further ascent.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

A. Adapt to circumstances.

B. A temporary position provides support through a transition.

C. "Any port in a storm."

D. "On hold."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows the geese gradually advanced to the high mound. It
suggests the idea of a wife who for three years does not become pregnant: but in the end
the natural issue cannot be prevented. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the summit. For three years
the woman has no child. In the end nothing can hinder her. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards the hillock. In the end, the results will
be incomparable -- good fortune!
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches the top of the hill. The woman is not pregnant
for three years. In the end, nothing can overcome her. Good fortune. [There will be
confusion in the beginning, but understanding later; after overcoming obstacles, things
will go smoothly in your life.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the mound. The wife,
three year's-time not pregnant. Completing: absolutely-nothing has mastering. Significant.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the mound: the wife for three years does not
get pregnant; in the end nothing overcomes it; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed onto a mountain top. The wife does not conceive for
three years, but in the end nothing defeats her. Good fortune.

Cleary (2): ... After all, no one could overcome her. This is auspicious.

Wu: The wild goose flies in gradually to rest on a hill. The woman has not been pregnant
for three years, but she finally overcomes her disadvantages. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The subject of the line will get what she desires. Wilhelm/
Baynes: In the end nothing can hinder good fortune. One attains one's wish. Blofeld:
Good fortune in the form of complete fulfillment of our desires. Ritsema/Karcher:
Acquiring the place desired indeed. Cleary (2): Getting what was wished for. Wu: She
gets what she wishes.

Legge: Line five is a dynamic line in the ruler's seat, and yet appears here as the symbol of
a wife. Somehow she has been at variance with, and kept in disgrace by, calumniating
enemies such as the plunderers of line three; but things come right in the end. The wife,
childless for three years, becomes at last a mother, and there is good fortune. The wife will
have a child; minister and ruler will meet happily.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Because of the calumny of deceitful people, the man is misjudged while advancing
into a high position. Although reconciliation and progress result eventually, nothing is
achieved in the interim.

Wing: As you gain an ever greater position of influence, you become more and more a
target for attack. Deceitful people may slander you, or you may even be misjudged by those
closest to you. Because you are isolated, nothing meaningful can be accomplished.
Eventually communications will be established and good fortune will follow.

Editor: The image is of a peak or goal which is somewhat subordinate to the extreme
heights of line six. The rewards of this attainment require more time to become
consolidated.
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

On the biological plane the irreconcilable elements of father and mother, of male
and female, are reconciled on a new level in the child, who carries in his own
person physical characteristics and psychological components derived from both
parents. It is not surprising, therefore, that in the images of the unconscious a
child frequently appears as the symbol of reconciliation on the psychological plane
within the individual.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. A delayed issue comes in due time.

B. Protracted labor brings forth an eventual synthesis.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows the geese gradually advanced to the large heights
beyond. Their feathers can be used as ornaments. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wild goose gradually draws near the cloud heights. Its feathers
can be used for the sacred dance. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The wild goose moves gradually towards the mainland. Its feathers can be used
for ritual purposes -- good fortune!

Liu: The wild goose gradually approaches the cloudy heights. Its feathers can be used in
ritual decoration. Good fortune. [You will carry out a significant undertaking with
someone’s help.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The wild-swan Infiltrating tending-towards the highlands. Its
feathers permit availing-of activating fundamentals. Significant.

Shaughnessy: The wild goose advances to the land: its feathers can be used to be
emblems; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Geese gradually proceed to level ground; their feathers can be used for
ceremonies. Good fortune.

Wu: The wild goose flies gradually into the clouds. Its feathers may be used for decorum.
Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The object and character of the subject of the line cannot be disturbed.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He is not to be disconcerted. Blofeld: The sentence about the
feathers indicates that now disorder cannot prevail. [The traditional Chinese conception
of good government, good order within the family and so on, allots an important role to
ritual because of its efficacy in making people inclined to regard their duties with
53 -- Gradual Progress-53

solemnity and because it helps to make everything seem orderly.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Not permitting disarray indeed. Cleary (2): They cannot be put in disarray. Wu: Don’t
mess it up.

Legge: The subject of line six has reached the top of the hexagram. There is no more
advance for him, and he has no correlate. He will work for the state and verify the auspice
derived from the ornamental plumes of the geese.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man reaches the pinnacle, completes his work, and leaves inspiration for the
world to follow.

Wing: As you achieve the greatest heights in your upward climb, you become an example
for others. You are emulated by those who admire you, and this in itself is the greatest
praise. There is good fortune for all concerned.

Editor: Most translations emphasize that the use of the feathers is for ritual or sacred
purposes. A feather used in religious ritual suggests spiritual thoughts, concepts, truths,
aspirations, ideals, etc. "The large heights beyond" would be the realm of ultimate
realities and eternal truths to which one aspires. Since one of the central ideas of the
hexagram is the contracting of a marriage, this line suggests the consummation of that
marriage, and the religious references indicate that it is a hieros gamos, or holy marriage.
If we combine Legge's image of ornaments with the idea of religious rites, the Chinese
concept of the proper attitude for sacrifice emerges:

In religious sacrifice ... the important thing is one’s attitude, especially sincerity, in
the performance. These sacrifices are "ornaments" or refined manifestations of an
inner attitude.
D.H. Smith -- Confucius

A. The image suggests a spiritual synthesis. Energy has been transformed -- the
dialectical progression has been successful.

B. The line can suggest the idea of a sacrifice which one makes on behalf of the
Work.

C. A successful union of opposites.

Judgment

Legge: Propriety indicates that action will be evil, and in no wise advantageous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden. Undertakings bring misfortune. Nothing
that would further.

Blofeld: The Marriageable Maiden. Advance brings misfortune. No goal (or
destination) is now favorable.

Liu: The Marrying Girl. Undertaking leads to misfortune. Nothing benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood, chastising: pitfall. Without direction:
Harvesting. [Without direction: Harvesting: ... In order to take advantage of the
situation, do not impose a direction on events.] [This hexagram describes your situation
in terms of the changing status of someone who cannot control their circumstances. It
emphasizes that finding a real field of activity through accepting this imposition is the
adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Returning maiden: To be upright is inauspicious; there is no place
beneficial.

Cleary (1): Making a young girl marry: To go on will lead to misfortune; no profit
is gained.

Cleary (2): Marrying a young girl. To go on an expedition leads to misfortune, with
nothing gained.

Wu: Marrying a Maiden indicates that it will be foreboding to make moves. There is
nothing to be gained.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

The Image

Legge: The waters of a Marsh with Thunder over it form the hexagram of Propriety.
The superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end, knows the
mischief that may be done at the beginning.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder over the lake: the image of The Marrying Maiden. Thus
the superior man understands the transitory in the light of the eternity of the end.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder over a pool. The Superior Man knows that,
to achieve an enduring end, he must be aware of his mistakes at the beginning.

Liu: Thunder over the lake symbolizes the Marrying Girl. The superior man knows
the cause of error, and persists in his virtue to the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh possessing thunder. Converting Maidenhood. A
chun tzu uses perpetually completing to know the cracked.

Cleary (1): There is thunder above a lake, making a young girl marry. Thus
superior people persist to the end and know what is wrong.

Cleary (2): Thunder over a lake – Marrying a young girl. Developed people consider
lasting results and know what is wrong. [The way developed people handle things is that
before they take the time to ask how to start something, they first consider lasting results.
If they think of lasting results, they know what is wrong with acting prematurely, like
marrying an immature girl. If you understand the meaning of this, you can apply it to
government and to contemplating mind as well.]

Wu: There is thunder above the marsh; this is Marrying a Maiden. Thus, the jun zi in
the pursuit of lasting excellence realizes the flaws and corrects them.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In the marriage of a young bride the proper relationship between
heaven and earth is seen. Nothing could grow or flourish if heaven and earth did not unite.
The marriage of a young bride is therefore both the commencement and goal of humanity.
But here the desire of pleasure employs movement to attain union. This action will be evil
because the lines are in inappropriate places, and the magnetic three and five are mounted
on dynamic lines.

Legge: The Chinese phrase for this hexagram might be equivalent to the English "giving
in marriage,” but there are some special meanings in this case which must be understood.
The Judgment gives a bad auspice because the trigram of the Youngest Daughter is
beneath the trigram of the Eldest Son. Since the action of the hexagram begins with the
lowest trigram, we have two violations of propriety. First, the marriage is initiated by the
woman and her friends. She goes unilaterally to her future home instead of the
bridegroom coming to fetch her. Second, the parties are unequally matched -- there is too
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

great a disparity in their ages. In addition, all the lines in the hexagram except the top and
the bottom are in places inappropriate for them. Some commentators insist that the
symbol of the contracting of a marriage in this hexagram sets forth some principles which
should obtain in the relation between a ruler and his ministers.

The growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth is
analogous to the increase of mankind through the interaction between male and female in
marriage. The K'ang-hsi editors reconcile this good auspice with the unfavorable
Judgment by saying: "The interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but
we ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end.”
The error here is that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she is
heedless of the disparity in their ages.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Propriety means that unilateral action is inappropriate.

The Superior Man understands that the Work is guided from within, and that choices
which ignore this truth can only retard its progress. (Present actions originate future
consequences: pay heed to your choices.)

The traditional name for this hexagram is The Marrying Maiden -- a title which
does not convey to modern western readers the subtlety of its symbolism. Blofeld says:
"This hexagram is, on the whole, a most unfortunate omen ... We must not suppose that
it deals only with marriage. What is said about the maiden symbolizes in some way or
other what we may expect for ourselves within the context of our enquiry." The figure is
certainly difficult, but "unfortunate" only if its import is resisted or denied: any portrayal
of our situation which eliminates illusion (however painful the realization), must be
regarded as a positive lesson.

Although the Confucian commentary describes this hexagram in terms of self-
seeking aspiration, the wretched protagonist of the figure is not invariably culpable, and
neither Judgment nor Image imply this. In addition to being at the very bottom of the
social pecking order, the maiden is portrayed as half-blind, crippled and a "slave."
Although condemned by the commentators for importuning a marriage that would raise
her status, a close reading of the lines reveals that only the sixth place suggests possible
impropriety -- the others all contain advice about how one of extremely low status should
cope with restricted circumstances. The hexagram therefore can deal with either of two
possible conditions: those involving Propriety and those involving Making-do as an
adaptation to adversity.

In the first instance, it is useful to compare the symbolism here with that of the
preceding hexagram of Gradual Progress. There we see the organic progression of the
Work allegorized as the proper marriage of a young woman. In this case, Gradual
Progress has been turned upside down and the symbolism reversed: this young woman
improperly pursues a marriage on her own initiative. Psychologically interpreted, it can be
regarded as an image of the ego pushing its own agenda or desire for union.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

The ego may move in directions and toward actions that are at variance with the
intentions and standards of the Self ... The mature adult needs to recognize
eventually his or her relative limitedness vis-à-vis the "Self- field" and the cosmic
organism of which s/he is but a cell. We are subject to the ordering and growth
intents of the entelechy of the whole.
E. C. Whitmont -- The Alchemy of Healing

To recognize our `relative limitedness “vis-à-vis the Self-field” is to renounce our
claim to unilateral action. Though the ego ardently desires a marriage with the Self, only
the Self can initiate such a union. Chou Tun I, an early Neo-Confucian, makes an
observation which illuminates Legge's Image:

"The superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end,
knows the mischief that may be done at the beginning. The most important things
in the world are tendencies. Tendencies may be strong or weak. If a tendency is
extremely strong, it cannot be controlled. But it is possible to control it quickly if
one realizes that it is strong. To control it requires effort. If one does not realize
early enough, it will not be easy to apply effort.”

To receive this hexagram without changing lines can be an admonition to examine
your motives and actions in the matter at hand. Where are you out of line? If no obvious
impropriety is involved, it could also portray an essentially impotent predicament. At such
times Ritsema/Karcher's synopsis bears repetition: "This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of the changing status of someone who cannot control their
circumstances. It emphasizes that finding a real field of activity through accepting this
imposition is the adequate way to handle it.”

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Compare Propriety with hexagram number fifty-three, Gradual Progress, then
compare them both with hexagram number thirty-one, Initiative. What are the
similarities in their ideas? Now look at hexagrams number eleven, seventeen and twenty-
two and observe the over-all philosophy which begins to emerge.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows the young woman married off in a position ancillary
to the real wife. It suggests the idea of a person lame in one leg who yet manages to tramp
along. Going forward will be fortunate.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden as a concubine. A lame man who is able to
tread. Undertakings bring good fortune.

Blofeld: The maiden marries and becomes a concubine. The lame can walk -- to advance
brings good fortune. [Some advance is indicated, but not a very splendid one. To become
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

a concubine is doubtless better than remaining single; to walk with a limp is better than
not walking at all – neither is greatly to be desired.]

Liu: The marrying maiden is to be a concubine. A crippled man can walk. Undertaking is
good fortune. [Even with limited ability a person will achieve his undertakings by
depending on someone influential.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood using the junior- sister. Halting enabling
treading. Chastising significant.

Shaughnessy: The returning maiden with younger sisters; the lame are able to walk; to
be upright is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Marrying off a young girl as a junior wife. The lame can walk. It is good to go
on. [The time is not right but her virtue is right, and she does not do anything improper.
This represents the ability to maintain rectitude when the time is not right.]

Cleary (2): Marrying a young girl, taking junior wives. The lame can walk. To go on leads
to good fortune.

Wu: The marrying of a young woman with her younger sister is like treading with one
lame leg. It is auspicious to proceed.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: That she is in a subordinate position is the constant practice in such a
case. Even though lame she can render useful service. Wilhelm/Baynes: "The marrying
maiden as a concubine,” because that gives duration. "A lame man who is able to tread...,”
because they receive each other. Blofeld: What is described in the first sentence was due
to her constancy; the second sentence presages mutual support. Ritsema/Karcher:
Using persevering indeed. Mutualizing receiving indeed. Cleary (2): The lame can walk
to good fortune because of service. Wu: It is auspicious because they have roles to play.

Legge: A feudal prince was said to marry nine ladies at once. The principal of them was
the bride who was to be the proper wife, and she was attended by two others, virgins from
her father's harem; a cousin and a half-sister, a daughter of her father by another mother
of inferior rank. Under line one the young woman of the hexagram appears in the inferior
position of this half-sister. But the line is dynamic, indicative of a female of firm virtue.
The mean condition and its duties are to be deplored, and give the auspice of lameness;
but notwithstanding, the secondary wife will in a measure discharge her service. There
will be good fortune.

Notwithstanding apparent disadvantages, an able officer may do his ruler good service. "It
is the constant practice for such a case" in the Confucian commentary seems to mean that
an ancillary wife has no right to the disposition of herself, but must do what she is told.
Thus it is that the mean position of the younger sister does not interfere with the service
that she can render.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man in a relatively low position enjoys the confidence of the prince.
Outwardly, he keeps tactfully behind the official ministers. Although this diminishes his
status, he continues to perform valuable services for the state.

Wing: Your position within the situation is low in stature, but you have the good fortune
of being taken into the confidence of a superior. If you remain Subordinate, you will
assure your security. You can then influence the situation using tact and reserve.

Editor: This line does not lend itself to the usual gender designation employed in this
book. Generally speaking, the line should be read as symbolic of any situation in which
one is in a subordinate, powerless position. Often it suggests the need for some sort of
compromise in the situation at hand.

In that game of interaction which the ego plays with the objective psyche, it
appears as if the cards were dealt by the unconscious, since it is the unconscious
which gives rise to and shapes the strength or weakness of the ego. The ego's
responsibility is to do the best that it can with the hand it is dealt.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. An image of making do with what you have. Get by as best you can.

B. Although in a weak and powerless position, you can still render service to the
Work.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows her blind of one eye, and yet able to see. There
will be advantage in her maintaining the firm correctness of a solitary widow.

Wilhelm/Baynes: A one-eyed man who is able to see. The perseverance of a solitary
man furthers.

Blofeld: The one-eyed man can see. Righteous persistence brings advantage to the
recluse. [It is not unusual for a one-eyed man to see, more or less, or for a recluse to
benefit from persistence in his meditations and devotions; neither of them symbolizes
anything at all remarkable.]

Liu: A one-eyed man can see. It benefits the solitary man to keep quiet.

Ritsema/Karcher: Squinting enabling observing. Harvesting: shade people's Trial.

Shaughnessy: The blind are able to see; beneficial for a dark man to determine.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

Cleary (1): The one-eyed can see. It is beneficial to be chaste as a hermit.

Wu: It is like looking with one injured eye. It is advantageous to having a recluse’s
perseverance.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has not changed from the constancy proper to a wife.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The permanent law is not changed. Blofeld: As yet, no change
occurs in the ordinary course of events. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet transforming the
rules indeed. Cleary (2): The benefit of the chastity of a hermit is not changing the norm.
Wu: He has not yet deviated from his course.

Legge: Line two is dynamic in a magnetic place, and her correlate is magnetic in a
dynamic place. Both, however, are central in their respective trigrams. With a weak
correlate, line two can't do much in the discharge of her duties, but if she thinks only of her
husband, like the widow who will die rather than marry again, such devotion will have its
effect and reward. Though blind in one eye, she still manages to see -- devoted loyalty in
an officer will compensate for many disadvantages.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Devoted loyalty on the part of the man will compensate for many weaknesses on the
part of his associates as well.

Wing: The situation is disappointing. It is up to you, alone, to carry on the original vision.
Such devotion and loyalty will ultimately bring progress.

Editor: The line does not lend itself to the usual gender designations used in this
book. Blofeld's Confucian commentary: "As yet, no change occurs in the ordinary course
of events” suggests that although we may not perceive or understand what is going on, we
still haven't violated the Work. Legge's rendition of "the firm correctness of a solitary
widow” implies virtuous abstinence -- not giving one's energy to any force that would
compromise our integrity.

It is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if
nobody can see it. It is much more needful to teach people the art of seeing. For it
is obvious that far too many people are incapable of establishing a connection
between the sacred figures and their own psyche: they cannot see to what extent
the equivalent images are lying dormant in their own unconscious. In order to
facilitate this inner vision we must first clear the way for the faculty of seeing.
How this is to be done without psychology, that is, without making contact with
the psyche, is, frankly, beyond my comprehension.
Jung -- Psychology and Alchemy

A. The situation has yet to clarify -- go it alone until the way becomes clear.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

B. Partial vision is better than none. Remain uncommitted, and do not depart from
your accustomed routine.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows the young woman who was to be married off in a
mean position. She returns and accepts an ancillary position.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden as a slave. She marries as a concubine.

Blofeld: From being a servant, the marriageable maiden becomes a concubine.
[Again, a small advance is made, but nothing very satisfying is won.]

Liu: The marrying girl is to be a maidservant. She marries as a concubine.

Ritsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood: using hair-growing. Reversing
Converting: using the junior-sister.

Shaughnessy: The returning maiden with consorts turns around and returns with
younger sisters.

Cleary (1): When the bride-to-be seeks, it will be the little sister who is married
instead.

Wu: The marrying of the young woman is being put on hold. Instead, her younger sister is
married in her place.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is shown by the improprieties indicated in the line. Wilhelm/
Baynes: She is not yet in the appropriate place. Blofeld: Her former state is indicated by
the unsuitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Not- yet appropriate indeed.
Cleary (2): The bride-to-be who seeks is not right. Wu: Because her position is improper.

Legge: The third line is magnetic in a dynamic place at the top of the trigram of Frivolity.
She is of so mean a character and such a slave of passion that no one will marry her. She
returns and accepts the position of a concubine.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: It is preferable to be a concubine rather than a slave. The inferior person enters into
situations incompatible with self-esteem, in pursuit of joys that cannot be attained
legitimately.

Wing: To attain your desires, it will be necessary for you to compromise your Self.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

Editor: There are at least two interpretations of this line: one portrays moving from an
abject position (slavery) to accept a correct, albeit still subservient role. On the other hand,
the line can suggest an attempt at a union or synthesis which is unstable or premature:
The imbalances within the situation cause its dynamics to be re-adjusted at a lower level
than desired. An inherent instability cannot be maintained no matter how much we want
it to be otherwise.

Those who do not seek release from the bondage of the instinctive drives by the
road of inner development remain the slaves of their own passionate desirousness
or suffer the sterility resulting from its ruthless repression. In any time of crisis
these persons have no power to curb their own barbaric reactions.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. An image of modestly improving one's position -- better a servant than a
slave.

B. "You can't always get what you want” – accept the best alternative.

C. Don't compromise yourself.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows the young woman who is to be married off
protracting the time. She may be late in being married, but the time will come.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Marrying Maiden draws out the allotted time. A late marriage
comes in due course.

Blofeld: The maiden stays unwed beyond the proper time, but the day comes when she
makes a late marriage.

Liu: The marrying girl postpones marriage. She will marry later, waiting for the right
time.

Ritsema/Karcher: Converting Maidenhood overrunning the term. Procrastinating
Converting possesses the season.

Shaughnessy: The returning maiden exceeds the appointed time, and tardily returns
having time.

Cleary (1): When it is the wrong time for a girl to marry, she delays the marriage until the
proper time.

Wu: The marrying of the young woman is postponed. A later date is anticipated.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: After waiting, the thing may be done all the better. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The state of mind that leads to drawing out of the allotted time indicates a desire
to wait for something before going. Blofeld: Her firm desire to postpone her marriage
indicates that we should wait before taking action. Ritsema/Karcher: Over-running the
term's purpose. Possessing awaiting and-also moving indeed. Cleary (2): The purpose of
putting off the marriage is to go at the right time. Wu: To wait for the right time.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, where it should be magnetic, but in the case of a female the
indication is not bad. The subject of the line, however, is in no haste. She waits, and the
good time will come. It is she who puts off the marriage, not the other way around.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The person does not throw her virtue away but waits. Her marriage will be all the
better for it.

Wing: You are faced with a situation in which you must now refrain from action in order
to await a more propitious time. It may appear that the world is passing you by as you wait,
but your reward for maintaining your principles is on its way.

Editor: The line does not lend itself to the usual gender designations used in this book.
The image is one of patient postponement, with assurance that the desired consequences
will occur in the course of time. Wilhelm's rendition of "allotted time” suggests that fate is
involved.

In the early community, the man who had learned to bide his time, for either
revenge, barter, or any other objective, also had the advantage over the one who
was compelled to act when the stimulus arose, without consideration of the
consequences. Through having disciplined his own instincts such a man gained
power over his more instinctively acting neighbors. The power of the medicine
man rested largely on such self-control.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Be patient -- a union comes in the course of time.

B. Wait and see. Don't commit yourself -- it will all make sense eventually.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, reminds us of the marrying of the younger sister of King
Ti-yi, when the sleeves of the princess were not equal to those of the still younger sister
who accompanied her in an inferior capacity. The case suggests the thought of the moon
almost full. There will be good fortune.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

Wilhelm/Baynes: The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage. The embroidered
garments of the princess were not as gorgeous as those of the serving maid. The moon
that is nearly full brings good fortune.

Blofeld: The Emperor's second marriageable daughter wore regal garments less splendid
that those of her bridesmaid. [The implication is that the princess showed better taste
than her maid in not dressing too grandly. We must be on our guard against
ostentation.] Close upon the full moon comes good fortune!

Liu: Emperor I gives his daughter in marriage. The embroidered dress of the princess is
not as splendid as that of the concubine. The moon is nearly full. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: The supreme burgeoning Converting Maidenhood. One's chief's
sleeves: One's junior-sister's sleeves not thus fine. The moon almost facing, significant.

Shaughnessy: Di Yi marries off the maiden: the primary wife's sleeves are not as fine as
her younger sister's sleeves; the day's moon is past full; auspicious.

Cleary (1): The emperor marries off his younger sister; the attire of the empress is not as
good as the attire of the young wife. The moon is nearly full. Good fortune.

Cleary (2): ... The attire of the lady is not as good as that of the junior wives. The moon is
almost full. This is auspicious.

Wu: Di Yi married off his younger sister. Her dress was not so elaborate as her younger
sister’s. The moon was almost full. Auspicious. [This was considered proper, for what was
proper was the virtuous union, not the wedding dress.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: That her sleeves were not equal to her inferior's shows her noble
character, indicated by the central position of the line. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is in
the middle, hence action has value. Blofeld: The first sentence means that, though we
may be of only middle rank, we should behave with true nobility. Ritsema/Karcher:
One's situation located-in the center. Using valuing movement indeed. Cleary (2): The
position is one of balance, behaving in a noble manner. Wu: Her position was central and
royal. She had no need for ornamentations.

Legge: The King's sister is here honorably married, suggesting that the adornment she
preferred was the "ornament of the hidden man of the heart.” Ch'eng-tzu says: "The
moon is not full, but only nearly full. A wife ought not to eclipse her husband.” She is in
the place of honor, with a proper correlate in line two.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is reminded that the sister of King I placed herself graciously below her
outranked husband and remained free of vanity. The moon that is full does not face the
sun.

Wing: When you can overlook your social position and stature and place yourself in the
service of another, you will realize good fortune. To accomplish this you must overcome
vanity, pride, and any ostentatious behavior. To Subordinate yourself to others,
regardless of their position, is now a good thing.

Editor: It is instructive to compare this line with the fifth line of hexagram number eleven,
Harmony, which also refers to King Ti-yi's younger sister. A clue to the symbolism
comes from the Neo-Confucian classic, The Doctrine of the Mean:

The Book of Odes says, "Over her brocaded robe, she wore a plain and simple
dress,” for she disliked the loudness of its color and patterns. Thus the way of the
superior man is hidden but becomes more prominent every day, whereas the way
of the inferior man is conspicuous but gradually disappears. It is characteristic of
the superior man to be plain, and yet people do not get tired of him. He is simple
and yet rich in cultural adornment. He is amiable and yet systematically
methodical. He knows what is distant begins with what is near. He knows where
the winds (moral influence) come from. And he knows the subtle will be
manifested. Such a man can enter into virtue.

We see here a princess-bride who is less attractively arrayed than her bridesmaid,
and a waxing moon which has yet to reach full illumination. The context of the line is a
royal marriage -- the hieros gamos or holy marriage of the alchemists which is also
described in hexagram number eleven. Psychologically, the image can suggest that during
a time when forces are coming together for synthesis, less important elements in the
situation may seem more attractive than the true essence. Since the moon isn't full yet, we
haven't seen all of the light -- full comprehension has yet to dawn. Sometimes the line
simply boils down to the idea that "things are
not what they seem.”

It should also be pointed out that the reaching up into the realm of the super-
conscious and its exploration, while approaching the consciousness of the Self,
may sometimes even constitute an obstacle to full Self- realization, to the reaching
of the summit where the personal-I awareness blends into awareness of the
spiritual Self. One can become so fascinated by the wonders of the super-
conscious realm, so absorbed in it, so identified with some of its special aspects or
manifestations as to lose or paralyze the urge to reach the summit of Self-
realization.
Roberto Assagioli -- Psychosynthesis

A. "You can't see the forest for the trees." The truth is hidden by distracting
elements, but in the fullness of time it will be revealed. Seek simplicity.
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

B. The true goal may seem less attractive than lesser, more seductive elements.

C. The simple solution is the best.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the young lady bearing the basket, but without
anything in it, and the gentleman slaughtering the sheep, but without any blood flowing
from it. There will be no advantage in any way.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it. The man
stabs the sheep, but no blood flows. Nothing that acts to further.

Blofeld: A woman holds a basket with nothing inside; a man stabs a sheep without
drawing blood. No goal (or destination) is favorable now.

Liu: The woman's basket is empty. The man stabs the sheep, but no blood comes.
Nothing beneficial.

Ritsema/Karcher: A woman receiving a basket without substance. A notable
disemboweling a goat without blood. Without direction: Harvesting. [Without
direction: Harvesting, WU YU LI: no plan or direction is advantageous; in order to
take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events.]

Shaughnessy: The woman holds up the basket, there is no fruit, the man stabs the
sheep, there is no blood; there is no place beneficial.

Cleary (1): The woman receives a chest, but there is nothing in it. The man sacrifices a
goat, but there is no blood. No benefit is gained.

Wu: The woman carries a basket that is bottomless; the man sacrifices a sheep that has no
blood. There is nothing to be gained.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The basket is empty. Wilhelm/Baynes: The reason that the top
line has no fruits is because it holds an empty basket. Blofeld: This top line implies
absence of solid worth, hence the symbol of holding an empty basket. Ritsema/
Karcher: Six above, without substance. Receiving an empty basket indeed.
Cleary (2): The top (line) has no fulfillment. This is receiving an empty chest. Wu: The
top line does not have anything substantial to offer, because she carries a bottomless
basket.

Legge: The sixth line is magnetic at the top of the hexagram, and without a proper
correlate, hence the unfortunate auspice. The marriage contract is broken, and union does
54 -- Propriety/Making-Do -- 54

not take place. The parties concerned offer sacrifices in the temple, but the woman's
basket is empty and the man's effort is fruitless.

Cleary (2): When one does not accumulate virtue in life, then one has no spirit after
death and cannot cause one’s descendants to flourish. Developed people, knowing what is
wrong by thinking of the lasting results, see this at the outset.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man goes through superficial actions, such as offering an empty basket and a
pre-slaughtered sheep to the gods, solely to preserve the form. This disregard for content
bodes no good for lasting associations.

Wing: Are you just going through the motions? Is there content to the refined manner
you present? If you are acting out of adherence to form, don't bother. Nothing will come of
it.

Editor: Like everything else in the Book of Changes, this line can symbolize an
enormous range of situations. At its most basic level, a union of opposites does not take
place. Whether or not blame is involved depends upon the circumstances. Note
that blame is not mentioned in the line itself.

Sacrifices, charities and penances performed without faith in the Supreme are
nonpermanent. O son of Prtha, they are useless both in this life and in the next.
Bhagavad-Gita 17: 28

A. An empty sacrifice, a fruitless offering, wasted effort.

B. A missed connection or fruitless union -- any further striving would be a waste of
energy.

C. "Don't cast your pearls before swine."

D. An image of hypocrisy of some sort.

ABUNDANCE (EXPANSION OF AWARENESS)

Other titles: Abundance, Fullness, The Symbol of Prosperity, Greatness, Abounding,
Richness, Prolific, Fruitful, Luxuriant, Zenith, Affluence, Correct Action, Lucid Behavior,
"Generally means that one will have enough for one's needs with a little over. Does not
mean large wealth as a rule." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Expansion of Awareness means progress and development. When the king is
enlightened there is no need to fear a change. Let him be as the sun at noon.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Abundance has success. The king attains abundance. Be not sad.
Be like the sun at midday.

Blofeld: Abundance -- success! The King inspires them. Do not be sad; it is fitting to be
like the sun at its zenith. [Abundance in itself is often good; but it is generally followed by
the waning of what was abundant; moreover, as we shall see, there can be abundance of
darkness, or anything else unpleasant. (The Judgment itself) may be taken as an
auspicious omen.]

Liu: Greatness. Success. The king attains greatness, without sadness; he should be like
the sun at midday.

Ritsema/Karcher: Abounding, Growing. The king imagining it. No grief. Properly sun
centering. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of profusion and abundance
reaching culmination. It emphasizes that exuberantly increasing things to their fullest is
the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Abundance: Receipt; the king approaches it; do not be sad. It is proper
for the middle of the day.

Cleary (1): Richness is developmental. Freedom from worry when the king is great
is suited to midday.

Cleary (2): Richness is success; a king attains this. Do not worry. Take advantage of the
sun at noon.

Wu: A sage king will attain abundance. There is no need to worry, for he knows the
expedience of observing the midday sun.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

The Image

Legge: The superior man, in accordance with this, decides cases of litigation, and
apportions punishments with exactness.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Both thunder and lightning come: the image of Abundance. Thus
the superior man decides lawsuits and carries out punishments.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder and lightning occurring simultaneously. The
Superior Man decides law suits and inflicts the necessary penalties.

Liu: Thunder and lightning coming together symbolize Greatness. The superior man
judges lawsuits and imposes punishments.

Ritsema/Karcher: Thunder, lightning, altogether culminating. Abounding. A chun
tzu uses severing litigating to involve punishing.

Cleary (1): Thunder and lightning both arrive, abundant. Thus do superior people pass
judgment and execute punishment.

Cleary (2): Thunder and lightning both come in richness. Thus do leaders pass
judgments and execute punishments.

Wu: Thunder and lightning come together; this is Abundance. Thus the jun zi decides
the verdicts and exacts the punishments.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The greatness of Expansion of Awareness is due to Movement
directed by Clarity. Although the king has attained this state, he must still make it greater.
But there is no need for anxiety -- let him be as the sun at noon: let his clarity shine on all
under the sky. As soon as sun and moon reach zenith their light begins to wane. The
intercourse of heaven and earth alternates between abundance and scarcity. It waxes and
wanes according to the seasons. How much more so with men or spiritual forces!
[Ritsema/Karcher translate "spiritual forces" [Kuei Shen] as: "The whole range of
imaginal beings both inside and outside the individual; spiritual powers, gods, demons,
ghosts, powers, fetishes." -- Ed.]

Legge: The written Chinese character denoting Expansion of Awareness is the
symbol of being large and abundant -- a condition of prosperity. In human affairs,
prosperity often gives place to its opposite. The lesson of the hexagram is to show how the
ruler may preserve the prosperity of his state and people. The component trigrams show
Motive Force under the direction of Intelligence. A ruler with these attributes will not fail
to maintain the progress and development of his kingdom. He is told not to be anxious,
but to study how he may always be like the sun at its zenith, cheering and enlightening all.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

It must be noted that a change has been introduced in this hexagram in explaining
the symbolism of the lines. Normally, for two lines to have a correct relationship one must
be female (magnetic) and the other male (dynamic). Here two dynamic male lines make a
proper correlation in the first and fourth places.

In the Image, lightning appears as the natural phenomenon of which Clarity is the
symbol in the lower trigram. The virtues of Clarity and Movement are required of the
superior man in judging litigation.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Don't grieve when the truth hurts: a loss of illusion is a gain in awareness.
Once truly attained, enlightenment cannot be lost, it can only be increased.

The Superior Man acts with clarity by accurately evaluating cause and effect. [Or: The
objective assessment of any contradiction is the road to comprehending it.]

The fifty-fifth hexagram is very intriguing in that it appears to have a misleading
title in the original Chinese, which is usually translated as Abundance, Fullness,
Prosperity, etc. All of the internal clues, plus empirical experience with the figure have
convinced me that the title Expansion of Awareness is a more accurate description of
the forces operating in this hexagram. Here is my reasoning:

First, the component trigrams of Clarity and Movement portray action directed by
clear comprehension, as well as awareness itself in motion or expansion. The title of
Abundance seems misleading because it suggests a relatively static condition, whereas the
combined trigrams in the figure symbolize Clear Movement. These trigrams appear in
reverse sequence in hexagram number twenty-one, Discernment, which symbolizes the
act of comprehending -- a dynamic function of consciousness described in the Image here
as a quest for justice: "Thus the superior man decides lawsuits and carries out
punishments." (Wilhelm) Notice also that the message for the superior man in this Image
is almost identical with that in Discernment: "Thus the kings of former times made firm
the laws through clearly defined penalties." (Wilhelm) The ancient kings can always be
taken as symbolic of archetypal forces (the "gods"), so their laws are those of nature, not of
humankind. Interpreted broadly, both messages counsel us to: "Comprehend the law of
Tao, or suffer the penalties of ignorance." Which is to say: "expand your awareness."

Second, note the message in the Judgment. Most of the translators render this by
comparing the king at the peak of his power with the sun at the peak of its illumination at
noon. The sun is the symbol of clarity and enlightenment, and the sun at its zenith
therefore symbolizes a high point of awareness.

Third, notice that lines two, three and four depict an eclipse of the sun through its
waxing, full and waning phases. This suggests ignorance gradually evolving toward
comprehension, which is finally attained in line five. The progression in the hexagram is
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

from ignorance to clarity, and then in line six, ignorance within clarity -- i.e., an image of
one who remains obtuse while surrounded by the light of illumination.

Fourth, the combined trigrams of shock and light (thunder and lightning) suggest
a sudden and numinous illumination: the sort of en-light-enment (expansion of
awareness) described by Yogis:

Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light
entering my brain through the spinal cord ... The illumination grew brighter and
brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt
myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light ... I was no
longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small
point of awareness confined in a body, but instead was a vast circle of
consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of
exaltation and happiness impossible to describe.
Gopi Krishna -- Kundalini, the Evolutionary Energy in Man

It is possible that the written character translated into English as Abundance
has these associations in Chinese. Unfortunately, the title of Abundance itself does not
immediately suggest in the English language the ideas that are integral in the symbolism
of the hexagram.

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject meeting with his mate. Though they are
both of the same character, there will be no error. Advance will call forth approval.

Wilhelm/Baynes: When a man meets his destined ruler, they can be together ten days,
and it is not a mistake. Going meets with recognition.

Blofeld: On meeting a prince of equal rank, though he accepts his hospitality for ten days,
he is not at fault -- progress is made in winning respect!

Liu: When a man meets a deputy ruler, there will be harmony between them for ten days.
No blame. Setting forth will lead to progress.

Ritsema/Karcher: Meeting one's equal lord. Although a decade, without fault. Going
possesses honor.

Shaughnessy: Meeting his consort's ruler; it is only the ten-day week; there is no
trouble; in going there will be elevation.

Cleary (1): Meeting your director, even as equals there is no blame. If you go on, there
will be exaltation.

Cleary (2): Meeting your partner, etc.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

Wu: He meets with his matched partner. Although they are of the same kind, there will be
no error. The meeting is favorable.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: If the subject of this line seeks to overpass that similarity, there will
be calamity. Wilhelm/Baynes: More than ten days is harmful. Blofeld: Were he to
exceed that time, he would invite calamity upon himself. [It is all very well to accept the
hospitality of our equals, but accepting too much of it will ultimately lead to trouble.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Exceeding a decade, calamity indeed. Cleary (2): If you carry the
equality too far, there will be disaster. Wu: It will be perilous if he tries to outshine his
partner.

Legge: Line one is dynamic in a dynamic place. His correlate is the dynamic fourth line,
which would normally be deemed unfortunate. But here the text calls line four the mate of
line one, and makes their belonging to the same category of no account. The lesson taught
is that mutual helpfulness is the great instrument for the maintenance of prosperity, and
the subject of this line is encouraged to go forward.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man meets his destined ruler and goes forth with his approval.
Mutual helpfulness is required for continued prosperity.

Wing: Associating with someone whose goals are similar to your own will now bring you
clarity and energy. It is not a mistake to continue in this close relationship until the project
is complete.

Editor: For two yang lines to be in proper correlation seems to contradict the logic upon
which the I Ching is founded, yet in this specific instance it is deemed correct. The image
suggests the affinity of similar principles or categories. The Confucian commentary may
be interpreted to mean that they remain united only to the extent that they are in accord.
To make more or less out of the situation than the analogy warrants is to break the
connection and lose the truth. Psychologically interpreted, the line can suggest a close
connection between ego and Self.

Maturity and development demand a confrontation of the ego and the Self. The
necessary adaptation of the ego is challenged by the Self's urge for the ego’s
transformation.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Make a logical connection -- perhaps a highly "intellectual" conceptualization is
in order. Focus on the principles of the Work to determine correct action.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

B. When correspondences are legitimate, take advantage of them; however, don't
make more out of such associations than the reality of the situation warrants.

C. For the moment at least, you are on the right track – this could change later.

D. Tentative or preliminary approval of the query at hand.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject surrounded by screens so large and
thick that at midday she can see from them the constellation of the Bushel. If she goes and
tries to enlighten her ruler who is thus emblemed, she will make herself to be viewed with
suspicion and dislike. Let her cherish her feeling of sincere devotion that she may thereby
move her ruler's mind, and there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The curtain is of such fullness that the polestars can be seen at noon.
Through going one meets with mistrust and hate. If one rouses him through truth, good
fortune comes.

Blofeld: So great is the obstruction that the midday sun appears to him as a tiny star. To
advance now would be to invite mistrust and various ills. However, confidence seems to be
on the increase -- good fortune!

Liu: The shield is so great that you can see the polestar at noon. Undertakings will lead to
suspicion and harm. Only truth can win the confidence of the ruler. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Abounding: one's screen. Sun centering: visualizing a bin. Going
acquiring doubt, affliction. Possessing conformity, like shooting-forth. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Making abundant his curtain; in the middle of the day one sees the
Dipper; in going one gets a suspicious illness; there is a return leaking-like.

Cleary (1): Increasing the shade, seeing stars at midday. If you go on this way you will
have doubt and affliction. But if there is sincerity and it is acted on, it will bring good
fortune.

Cleary (2): With abundant shade, you see stars at midday. If you go, you will be afflicted
by doubt. If sincerity is expressed, there will be good fortune.

Wu: He makes abundance of curtains. His house is so dimmed as if he could see the
Dipper with the sun at noon. If he goes to meet with his correlate, he may be suspected.
But if he lets his sincerity prevail, it will be auspicious.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: It is by sincerity that the mind is affected. Wilhelm/Baynes: One
must rouse his will through trustworthiness. Blofeld: Presently people's trust will help us
to accomplish our will. Ritsema/Karcher: Trustworthiness using shooting-forth
purpose indeed. Cleary (2): Expressing sincerity means expressing intention truthfully.
Wu: Sincerity can change the impressions of others.

Legge: The magnetic second line is in her correct place in the center of the lower trigram
of Clarity. Her ruler is the magnetic and incorrect fifth line whose ignorance doesn't
recognize line two's intelligence. If two tries to advance she won't be acceptable to the
ruler, and will not be employed. The only way to be useful under such circumstances is to
sincerely develop her inner light until it is recognized.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Intrigues have put a barrier between the chief executive desiring great works and the
man capable of bringing them about. The courtiers have usurped the ruler's power. The
man should not take energetic action, which will only lead to suspicion and dislike. He
must depend upon his sincere devotion to move the ruler's mind in a less obvious way.

Wing: You lack influence in regard to the object of your interest. Obstacles not of your
own making stand in the way of your progress. If you attempt to push ahead, you will
invite envy and suspicion. There is a possibility of a fortunate outcome only if you are
continuously sincere and truthful. Then your influence may reach.

Editor: The image of screens so thick that the stars can be seen at noon is psychologically
an eclipse of consciousness by ignorance. The answer or solution is available, but you or
someone involved in the matter at hand doesn't see it. Sometimes the line can hint at an
estrangement between ego and Self beyond our ability to understand at the moment.

Never in any circumstances should one indulge in the unscientific illusion that
one's own subjective prejudice is a universal and fundamental psychological truth.
No true science can spring from this, only a faith whose shadow is intolerance and
fanaticism. Contradictory views are necessary for the evolution of any science,
only they must not be set up in rigid opposition to each other but should strive for
the earliest possible synthesis.
Jung -- The Symbolic Life

A. Clarity is obscured by ignorance and mistrust. Intelligence unrecognized is
intelligence unused. Allow the situation to develop until the way becomes clear.

B. It is not always possible to understand what is taking place below the threshold
of awareness -- hold to the precepts of the Work when you are uncertain of your role.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject with an additional screen of a large and
thick banner, through which at midday he can see the small Mei star. In the darkness he
breaks his right arm; but there will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The underbrush is of such abundance that the small stars can be seen
at noon. He breaks his right arm. No blame.

Blofeld: So copious is the rain that, even at midday, there is obscurity. He breaks his
right forearm -- no error!

Liu: Heavy clouds -- a fine drizzle can be seen. He hurts his right arm. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Abounding: one's profusion. Sun centering: visualizing froth.
Severing one's right arm. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Making abundant his screen; in the middle of the day one sees small
stars; breaking his right bow, there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Increasing shade, seeing glimmering stardust at midday. One breaks one’s
right arm. No one is to blame.

Cleary (2): With abundant rain, you see the drops in the sunlight. You break your right
arm but are not to blame.

Wu: He makes abundance of heavy curtains. His house is so dimmed as if he could see
small stars with the sun at noon. He breaks his right forearm. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Great things should not be attempted in such circumstances. His
broken arm means that in the end he will not be fit to be employed. Wilhelm/Baynes:
One can carry out no great transactions. In the end, one must not try to do anything.
Blofeld: There is nothing great we can accomplish now. His breaking his right forearm
indicates uselessness up to the very end. [It is not clear whether the omen refers to our
own uselessness for the task we have set ourselves or to that of someone on whom we
have been depending. We must interpret the line in the context of our enquiry.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Not permitting Great Affairs indeed. Completing, not permitting
availing-of indeed. Cleary (2): When the rain is abundant, you cannot do great works.
When you break your right arm, it cannot be used. Wu: He will not have big achievements.
(His arm) will no longer be used again.

Legge: Line three is dynamic in its proper place in the trigram of Clarity. This seems to
favor his action, but his correlate is the magnetic sixth line at the extremity of the trigram
of Movement. Since the sixth line is powerless, line three has no one to cooperate with
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

him. His situation is worse than that of line two, but his own proper goodness and
capacity will save him from error. Mei is a small star in or near the constellation of the
Bushel. The light in line three is hidden, and this blindness unfits him for employment.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The prince is so eclipsed that even insignificant personalities push themselves onto
the stage. Although the man is in a key position, he is powerless to achieve anything. But
he remains free of error.

Wing: Incompetence is at its Zenith. Be patient.

Editor: Midday is noon -- normally the zenith of illumination, and hence symbolic of
awareness or truth. Here however, a condition equivalent to a full solar eclipse is
portrayed. (The exact opposite of the position of the king in the Judgment.) The "small
Mei star" is a distant sun, a lesser light: symbolically, a feeble comprehension. Darkness is
ignorance, and the right arm represents one's power or ability to act. Blofeld, Liu,
Ritsema/Karcher and Cleary (2) state that rain or "froth" is screening the light -- a hint
that emotion may be clouding clear perception. (Water symbolizes the emotional realm.)
These somewhat confused images nevertheless all agree that clear choice is eclipsed by
ignorance: you are essentially powerless, and should refrain from significant action. If this
is the only changing line, the new hexagram becomes number 54, Propriety, the
Judgment of which states that "action will be evil, and in no wise advantageous."

I am an empiricist, not a philosopher; I cannot let myself presuppose that my
peculiar temperament, my own attitude to intellectual problems, is universally
valid. Apparently this is an assumption in which only the philosopher may
indulge, who always takes it for granted that his own disposition and attitude are
universal, and will not recognize the fact, if he can avoid it, that his "personal
equation" conditions his philosophy.
Jung -- The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious

A. You are hampered by incomplete data: "There is more to the subject than meets
the eye.” Useful action is impeded: Don’t act when you don’t know.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject in a tent so large and thick that at
midday he can see from it the constellation of the Bushel. But he meets with the subject of
the first line, undivided like himself. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The curtain is of such fullness that the polestars can be seen at noon.
He meets his ruler, who is of like kind. Good fortune.

Blofeld: So great is the obstruction that the midday sun appears to him as a tiny star.
Meeting a prince of equal rank -- good fortune!
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

Liu: The shield is so great that you can see the polestar at noon. One meets an ignorant
ruler. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Abounding: one's screen. Sun centering: visualizing a bin. Meeting
one's hiding lord. Significant.

Shaughnessy: Making abundant his curtain; in the middle of the day one sees the
Dipper; meeting his placid ruler; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Increasing shade, seeing stars at midday. Meeting the hidden master is
auspicious.

Wu: He makes abundance of curtains. His house is so dimmed as if he could see the
Dipper with the sun at noon. He meets with his equal partner. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The position of the line is inappropriate. There is darkness and no
light. The good fortune of meeting the first line means that action may be taken.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the appropriate one. He is dark and not light-giving.
This means action. Blofeld: The extent of the obstruction is indicated by the unsuitable
position of this line. His seeing only a tiny star at midday implies nothing wherewith to
lighten the darkness surrounding us. His good fortune in meeting a prince of equal rank
indicates that action can now be taken. [We are obstructed by ignorance or stupidity and
should not act until someone ready to help us appears.] Ritsema/Karcher: Situation
not appropriate indeed. Shade, not brightening indeed. Significant movement indeed.
Cleary (2): With abundant shade, the position is not appropriate. Seeing the stars at
midday means it is dark and dim. Meeting the hidden master is auspicious in terms of
action. Wu: Because his house is darkened, etc.

Legge: The first sentence of line four is the same as line two, until we come to the strange
correlation of the two dynamic lines in four and one, and the issue is good. An alternative
translation is: "He meets with the subject of the parallel line."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The eclipse is decreasing. The man gets together with elements with which he has a
natural affinity.

Wing: Although your position as been less than ideal, you will finally meet with the right
elements to help you achieve your aim. Enthusiasm coupled with wise decisions lead to
good fortune.

Editor: The essential image is one of ignorance (darkness) which is dispelled by an
alliance or connection. Ordinarily one would not expect to take action when in the dark
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

about the situation in question, but here action is advised in order to dispel the darkness.
Because of the unusual correct correlation between two dynamic lines, the image suggests
that a highly abstract, "intellectual" association may be called for here.

Nowhere is the basic requirement so indispensable as in psychology that the
observer should be adequate to his object, in the sense of being able to see not only
subjectively but also objectively. The demand that he should see only objectively is
quite out of the question, for it is impossible. We must be satisfied if he does not
see too subjectively.
Jung -- Psychological Types

A. When you're in the dark, seek help: Take steps to clarify the situation.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject bringing around her the men of brilliant
ability. There will be occasion for congratulation and praise. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Lines are coming, blessing and fame draw near. Good fortune.

Blofeld: The variegated beauty of the sky after a storm now appears. Blessings
[Unexpected or seemingly unmerited good fortune] and fame are won -- good fortune!

Liu: Glory will come, causing prosperity and recognition. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Coming composition. Possessing reward, praise, significant.

Shaughnessy: There comes a pattern, celebratory and uplifting; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Bringing beatification, there is glory; this is auspicious.

Cleary (2): Bringing brilliance, there is celebration and praise, etc.

Wu: If he could welcome his notable partner, there would be something to celebrate and
praise. Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is the congratulation that is sure to arise.
Wilhelm/Baynes: It bestows blessing. Blofeld: Here, good fortune connotes the
blessings already mentioned. Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing reward indeed. Cleary
(2): There is joyful celebration. Wu: His good fortune depends on that there is
something praiseworthy.

Legge: Line five is the ruler's place, magnetic herself, but the ruler of the trigram of
Movement. She can do little without assistance, but if she can bring into her service the
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

talents of lines one, three and four, and even of two, her magnetic correlate, the results will
be admirable. Nothing consolidates the prosperity of a country so much as the
cooperation of the ruler and her able ministers.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The modest ruler assembles ministers of brilliant ability around him. Especially is he
attracted to men who are sound of heart and sure of getting results.

Wing: Be receptive to the opinions of others. Invite counsel from the most able helpers
you know. Such modesty brings unexpected good fortune and rewarding results for all
concerned.

Editor: "Brilliant ability" refers to the lines of the lower trigram of Clarity which rise to
assist and reinforce the central line in the trigram of Movement. Wilhelm refers to these
lines directly; Blofeld calls them "variegated beauty;" Liu, "Glory;" Ritsema/Karcher
translate it as "composition"-- ("a well-composed whole and its structure; beautiful
creations.") Shaughnessy dubs it a "pattern," etc. – none of the translators use exactly the
same term. Because this is the ruler's place, all versions implicitly refer to the imagery in
the Judgment: "The king attains abundance. Be not sad. Be like the sun at midday." Note
however, that everyone except Blofeld places this in the future: it seems to be a coming
event. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram created is number 49,
Metamorphosis, suggesting that an Expansion of Awareness may be in the offing:
"Comes the dawn!"

For it is the function of consciousness not only to recognize and assimilate the
external world through the gateway of the senses, but to translate into visible
reality the world within us.
Jung -- The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche

A. You are surrounded by forces of enlightenment and lucid action is possible.
"Gather your wits about you" -- clarity approaches.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with her house made large, but
only serving as a screen to her household. When she looks at her door, it is still, and there
is nobody about it. For three years no one is to be seen. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His house is in a state of abundance. He screens off his family. He
peers through the gate and no longer perceives anyone. For three years he sees nothing.
Misfortune.

Blofeld: There is abundance in his dwelling and a wall around his house; yet, peering
through the gate, he sees no one. For three years, he sees nobody -- misfortune!
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

Liu: One's house is big and luxurious; later it will be overgrown. Someone looks in at the
gate and does not see anyone. For three years he sees nothing. Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Abounding: one's roof. Screening one's dwelling. Peeping-through
one's door. Living-alone, one without people. Three year's-time not encountering. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Making abundant his room, screening his house, and arching his window;
he is alarmed at his having no people; for three years he does not follow; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Embellishing the room, shading the house; peeking in the door, it is quiet,
with no one there, unseen for three years. Inauspicious.

Cleary (2): Making the house rich, shading the home. A peek in the door finds quiet, etc.

Wu: He has his house richly decorated. He uses curtains to shield his home. Peeping
through its door, one sees not a single soul. For three years, nobody has been seen therein.
Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has made her house large -- she soars in her pride to the heavens.
She looks at her door, which is still, with no one about it -- she only keeps herself
withdrawn from all others. Wilhelm/Baynes: He flutters about at the border of heaven.
He screens himself off. Blofeld: He seems to be hovering on the border of the skies. He
has deliberately hidden himself. [The whole of this refers to someone who had done very
well for himself but who, out of snobbery or for a similar reason, refuses to share his
good fortune and therefore remains alone and miserable amidst his splendid
possessions.] Ritsema/Karcher: The heavenly border, hovering indeed. Originating-
from concealing indeed. Cleary (2): Making the house rich is pride. For one has hidden
oneself. Wu: He has made himself feel like flying high in the sky. For he has hidden
himself from the rest of the world.

Legge: All the conditions of line six are unfavorable, and she is left to herself without any
helpers. Her long isolation undoes her -- the issue is only evil. No one but herself has any
confidence in her. She holds herself aloof from others, and they leave her to herself.

Anthony: If, after being helped, as in the fifth line, we seek only to have our own way, or
to be master of the situation, we lose all the benefits of acting correctly. If we are to make
progress, we must keep our motives pure.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is overwhelmed by his pride as he seeks personal splendor, alienating even
members of his own household. He becomes isolated and is undone.
55 -- Abundance (Expansion of Awareness) -- 55

Wing: Your quest for abundance has made you proud. Your desire to maintain it has
isolated you. You are out of harmony with the times and out of touch with those close to
you. Therefore you have already lost your greatest possessions.

Editor: A "house made large" symbolizes an expanded psyche, or a situation of abundant
choice. That this is "a screen to her household” tells us that important aspects of the
situation are unrecognized: She "can't see the trees for the forest.” Legge's "still” door is a
portal closed to awareness. In short, because of self-chosen isolation, she doesn't take
advantage of an abundance of unperceived opportunities. A hermit’s life of renunciation
may bring about an expansion of awareness, but it is wasted if one does not take
appropriate action in the world. Ironically, the hexagram created when this is the only
changing line is number 30, Clarity, offering a clear image of what she is missing in life.

Communication must be radiation and receiving and exchange. Whenever
irritation is involved, then we are not able to see properly and fully and clearly the
spacious quality of that which is coming toward us, that which is presenting itself
as communication. The external world is immediately rejected by our irritation
which says, “No, no, this irritates me, go away.” Such an attitude is the complete
opposite of transcendental generosity. So the bodhisattva must experience the
complete communication of generosity, transcending irritation and self-
defensiveness. Otherwise, when thorns threaten to prick us, we feel that we are
being attacked, that we must defend ourselves. We run away from the tremendous
opportunity for communication that has been given to us, and we have not been
brave enough even to look to the other shore of the river. We are looking back and
trying to run away.
Chogyam Trungpa

A. You are out of touch with reality -- blind to the light which surrounds you, too
myopic to see your options.

56 -- Transition -- 56
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-SIX –
TRANSITION

Other titles: The Wanderer, The Symbol of the Traveler, The Exile, Sojourning, The
Newcomer, To Lodge, To Travel, Traveling, The Stranger, Strangers, The Traveling
Stranger, The Outsider, The Alien, The Gnostic, The Tarot Fool, Wandering, Homeless,
Uncommitted, On Your Own, "Can refer to being out of one's element." -- D.F. Hook

Judgment

Legge: Transition means that small attainments are possible. If the traveling stranger is
firm and correct, there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Wanderer. Success through smallness. Perseverance brings
good fortune to the wanderer.

Blofeld: The Traveler -- success in small matters. Persistence with regard to traveling
brings good fortune.

Liu: The Exile. Small success. To continue leads to good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sojourning, the small: Growing. Sojourning, Trial: significant.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of wandering journeys and living in
exile. It emphasizes that mingling with others as a stranger whose identity comes from a
distant center is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Traveling. Small receipt. Traveling; determination is auspicious.

Cleary (1): Travel is developmental when small; if travel is correct, it leads to good
fortune.

Cleary (2): Travel has a little success. Travel is auspicious if correct.

Wu: Traveling indicates small pervasion. Perseverance will bring auspiciousness.

The Image

Legge: A fire on the mountain -- the image of Transition. The superior man exerts
cautious wisdom in his punishments, and does not permit prolonged litigation.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Wilhelm/Baynes: Fire on the mountain: the image of The Wanderer. Thus the
superior man is clear-minded and cautious in imposing penalties, and protracts no
lawsuits.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire upon a mountain. The Superior Man employs
wise caution in administering punishments and does not suffer the cases brought before
him to be delayed.

Liu: Fire over the mountain symbolizes the Exile. The superior man is careful and clever
in imposing punishments, and does not delay the cases brought.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above mountain possessing fire. Sojourning. A chun tzu uses
brightening consideration to avail-of punishing and-also not to detain litigating.

Cleary (1): There is fire atop a mountain, transient. Thus superior people apply
punishments with understanding and prudence, and do not keep people imprisoned.

Cleary (2): Fire on a mountain – traveling. Etc.

Wu: There is fire on the mountain; this is Traveling. Thus the jun zi exercises the
utmost deliberations in exacting punishments such that prisoners will not be detained
without cause.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Transition indicates that there may be some small attainment and
progress -- the magnetic line occupies the central place in the upper trigram, and is
obedient to the dynamic lines above and below it. We also have the attributes of Keeping
Still connected with Intelligence in the lower and upper trigrams. Hence it is said that
there may be some small attainment and progress. If the traveling stranger is firm and
correct as he ought to be, there will be good fortune. Great is the time and great is the
right course to be taken under these circumstances!

Legge: The written Chinese character for this hexagram denotes people traveling abroad,
and is often translated as Strangers. The figure addresses itself to traveling strangers, and
tells them how they ought to comport themselves through the cultivation of humility and
firm correctness. By means of these they would escape harm, and make progress. The
status of traveling stranger is seen as too low to expect great things of them.

It is assumed that the wanderer is in the position of the fifth line. The ideas of
humility, docility, calmness and intelligence are derived from the attributes of the
component trigrams. These are all characteristics which are proper to a stranger, and are
likely to lead to advancement and attainment of his desires. Concerning the Image, K'ung
Ying-ta comments: "A fire on a mountain lays hold of the grass, and runs with it over the
whole space, not stopping anywhere long, and soon disappearing -- such is the emblem
of the traveler."
56 -- Transition -- 56
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: During a Transition, keep your willpower great and your expectations
small.

The Superior Man sees clearly and does not embroil himself in complexity. He is clear-
minded and cautious in judging the truth of the situation, maintaining detachment from
the social milieu.

Wilhelm's translation of the title of this hexagram is The Wanderer. A wanderer
is one who has no home, or who is between one home and another. This reminds us of the
gnostic notion of the "Alien": the incarnate soul exiled to wander in the space-time
dimension (i.e., this world).

The alien is that which stems from elsewhere and does not belong here ... The
stranger who does not know the ways of the foreign land wanders about lost; if he
learns its ways too well, he forgets that he is a stranger and gets lost in a different
sense by succumbing to the lure of the alien world and becoming estranged to his
own origin ... The recollection of his own alienness, the recognition of his place of
exile for what it is, is the first step back; the awakened homesickness is the
beginning of the return.
Hans Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion

In the broadest interpretation then, the message in the Judgment: "If the traveling
stranger is firm and correct, there will be good fortune" can refer to not becoming
entangled in the affairs of this world in which we wander -- an idea emphasized in the first
line. Ritsema/Karcher state it explicitly -- defining our challenge as "mingling with others
as a stranger whose identity comes from a distant center." This is good general advice for
anyone seriously engaged in the Work, since the "distant center" ("God," or the Self)
represents the essence we incarnated to serve.

We are strangers in this world, and the body is the tomb of the soul, and yet we
must not seek to escape by self- murder; for we are the chattels of God who is our
herdsman, and without his command we have no right to make our escape.
Pythagorean ethic

In more specific situations, the hexagram symbolizes a transitional phase. Lines
two, three and four all depict "Inns" or temporary resting places (commonly experienced
in dreams as images of hotels or motels). The symbolism is identical: the psyche is
reflecting an interim situation during a state of Transition.

By definition, a transition is fluid and not yet fixed. Depending upon the choices
made, one can go in different directions. In terms of consciousness, it is obvious that the
transition can be from a lower state of awareness to a higher one, or vice-versa. Because a
transition is an opportunity for deliberate choice-making, the Confucian commentary
56 -- Transition -- 56

concludes with: "Great is the time and great is the right course to be taken under these
circumstances!"

Lines one, three and six depict very negative situations involving ignorant, arrogant
choices. We think of the ego blindly pushing the river of its desires, unable to see the
unfortunate consequences it thereby engenders. Line two suggests a solid resting place
during our journey, while line four depicts a tenuous, though not necessarily incorrect,
similar situation. The fifth line counsels a kind of sacrifice to the ruler (the Self) which
results in an eventual reward. The message is to let the Self guide you through a
Transition.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

Hexagram number fifty-six is the reverse of hexagram number fifty-five. Compare
the role of the superior man in the Image of each figure. How are they the same? How are
they different? What are the differences and similarities of the component trigrams of
each hexagram, and how do they affect their respective meanings?

Notes, August 15, 2009: A new paraphrase of the Judgment and Image:

The Gnostic Alien. Small attainments are possible if the Alien keeps a clear head
and maintains his self-discipline. The initiated Adept is intelligent, discreet, and
displays vigilant wisdom: he maintains and protects his gnosis via cautious reserve
in worldly disputes, eschewing needless contention. [He can do this because he
knows that this is an illusory reality: a set-up, a trap, a Loosh factory created by the
Demiurge.] A chun tzu uses brightening consideration to avail-of punishing and-
also not to detain litigating. [In other words “do the work in the place in which you
find yourself” quickly, and efficiently, with as few entanglements as possible under
the circumstances. Shun new karma. Implicit is that this experience is preparation
for the bodhisattva vow.]

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows the stranger mean and meanly occupied. It is thus
that she brings on herself further calamity.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things, he draws down
misfortune upon himself.

Blofeld: Trifling with unimportant matters, the traveler draws upon himself calamity.

Liu: If the exile dallies with petty matters, he will draw disaster on himself.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sojourning: fragmenting, fragmenting. Splitting-off one's place,
grasping calamity.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Shaughnessy: Traveling so trivially; this is the fire that he has taken.

Cleary (1): Restless in travel, this is the misfortune you get.

Cleary (2): Petty fussing on a journey brings misfortune.

Wu: The traveler complains about trivial things and he is poorly received.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her aim has become of the lowest character, and calamity will ensue.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Thereby his will is spent, and this is a misfortune. Blofeld: The
calamity attendant upon having no will of our own. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose
exhausted, calamity indeed. Cleary (2): The misfortune of frustration. Wu: His small-
mindedness causes poor reception.

Legge: Line one is magnetic in a dynamic place at the bottom of the hexagram, thus the
unfavorable auspice. The meanness of the first line doesn't arise from the nature of her
occupation, but from her mind and aim being emptied of all that is good and ennobling.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the newcomer in a lowly position is occupying himself with
disgraceful machinations. His aspirations invite troubles.

Wing: Do not assume a demeaning role in the general situation. Do not pay attention to
trivial matters. This is not a way to gain entry into a group or situation. Maintain a
dignified attitude about yourself. Through self-abasement you will only invite ridicule.

Editor: Legge's "Mean" is rendered by the other translators as: "trivial," "unimportant,"
and "petty." The Confucian commentaries are translated as a failure of willpower which
brings about disaster. Implied is loss of purpose and hence of being unclear or ignorant of
the situation at hand.

All men, from birth onward, live more by sensation than by thought, forced as
they are by necessity to give heed to sense impressions. Some stay in the sensate
their whole life long. For them, sense is the beginning and end of everything.
Good and evil are the pleasures of sense and the pains of sense; it is enough to
chase the one and flee the other. Those of them who philosophize say that therein
wisdom lies. Like big earthy birds are they, prevented by their bulk from rising off
the ground even though they have wings.
Plotinus -- The Enneads

A. Don't waste your energy on unimportant matters.

B. "Trivial pursuit."
56 -- Transition -- 56
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows the stranger occupying her lodging-house,
carrying her means of livelihood, and provided with good and trusty servants.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wanderer comes to an inn. He has his property with him. He
wins the steadfastness of a young servant.

Blofeld: The traveler reaches an inn with his valuables still nestling safely in the bosom
of his robe. He gains the loyalty of a young servant. [This implies that we need fear no loss
upon our journey.]

Liu: The exile arrives at an inn. He carries valuables. He wins the loyalty of a young
servant.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sojourning, approaching a resting-place. Cherishing one's own.
Acquiring a youthful vassal: Trial.

Shaughnessy: In traveling having just lodged, he cherishes his belongings, getting the
young servant's determination.

Cleary (1): Coming to a lodge on a journey with money in your pocket, you have
attendants, yet are upright.

Cleary (2): Coming to an inn on a journey with supplies in hand, one gains the loyalty of
a servant.

Wu: The traveler makes a stop with his valuable belongings and gets help from a
trustworthy bellboy.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: With such servants she will in the end have nothing of which to
complain. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is not a mistake in the end. Blofeld: There will be no
trouble to the very end. Ritsema/Karcher: Completing without surpassing indeed.
Cleary (2): After all there is no complaint. Wu: He is free from troubles.

Legge: Line two is magnetic, but in her proper and central place. Hence the traveler is
represented as provided with everything she requires, and though the auspice is not
mentioned, we must understand it as being good. Strong and trusty servants are the most
important condition for the comfort and progress of the traveler.
56 -- Transition -- 56
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man retains his inner sense of modesty and reserve. He acquires the necessary
means of livelihood, a home, and good and trustworthy servants.

Wing: With confidence and self-possession you can attract support from new
environments. Think of it as the personal gravity generated by the weight of your
principles. Someone is ready to help you in your endeavors.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, the image of a wandering stranger portrays the
ego en-route to somewhere else -- transient, uncommitted, undergoing change. A lodging
house or Inn is a temporary shelter, an interim point of view, a transitory state. Legge's
"means of livelihood" (rendered as "valuables," "property," "belongings," “money” or
“supplies” by the other translators), can be any wealth, gain, power, ability, or
consolidation of psychic energy. Most translators qualify "servants" as "young servant."
A young servant would symbolically suggest inexperienced, untried power or ability to do
work. These images all suggest the consolidation of energy during a period of transition.

If the emphasis is on the temporary and transient nature of the worldly sojourn
and on the condition of being a stranger, the world is called also the "inn," in
which one "lodges"; and "to keep the inn" is a formula for "to be in the world" or
"in the body."
H. Jonas -- The Gnostic Religion

A. One preserves one's gains through a transition and obtains new and untried
powers. You have everything you need to succeed.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows the stranger, burning his lodging-house, and
having lost his servants. However firm and correct he tries to be, he will be in peril.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wanderer's inn burns down. He loses the steadfastness of his
young servant. Danger.

Blofeld: Owing to the traveler’s lack of caution, the inn is burnt down and he no longer
enjoys the young servant's loyalty. Persistence now would lead to trouble. [Our
carelessness leads us into such difficulties that it would be folly to proceed.]

Liu: The inn where the exile stays burns down. He loses the loyalty of his young servant.
To continue is dangerous.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sojourning, burning one's resting-place. Losing one's youthful vassal.
Trial: adversity.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Shaughnessy: In traveling burning his lodging, and losing his young servant;
determination is dangerous.

Cleary (1): Burning the lodge on a journey, you lose your attendants. Even if righteous
there is danger.

Cleary (2): Burning the inn on a journey, losing the servants, is dangerous even if one is
upright.

Wu: The lodge is on fire. He loses the favor of his helper. He is in danger even persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: By burning down his lodging-house he himself also suffers harm.
When as a stranger, he treats those below him as the line indicates, the right relation
between master and servant is lost. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is a loss for him personally.
If he deals like a stranger with his subordinate, it is only right that he should lose him.
Blofeld: Traveling on a downward path, our sense of duty and fitness is impaired.
Ritsema/Karcher: Actually truly using injuring. One's righteousness lost indeed.
Cleary (2): One will also be injured. Duty is lost. Wu: It is a pity. Being stern to the
helper in traveling is an invitation to loss.

Legge: The third line is dynamic in a dynamic place, but because he is at the top of the
lower trigram, he may be expected to be violent. In the case symbolized he is violent to an
extraordinary degree, and incapable of correctness. He treats those below him (his
servants) with arrogance, which of course alienates them from him. The K'ang-hsi editors
remark that the second and third lines are represented as having lodging-houses when the
other lines don't, because they are the only two lines in the figure who are in their proper
places.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The newcomer becomes arrogant and truculent. He eventually loses his house and
servant and finds himself without support in a perilous situation.

Wing: Offensive and careless behavior in your position are great mistakes. You are in
danger of losing what security you have by interfering in matters that are not your concern.
Those who may have once been loyal will then withdraw, leaving you in a perilous state.

Editor: Wilhelm points out that the dynamic line in a dynamic place is in this case too
overbearing -- representing one who shows no respect for either those above or below him.
For a "stranger in a strange land" to behave in this fashion is a sure formula for failure.
One is reminded of the boorish behavior of some tourists in foreign countries -- their
insensitivity invariably costs them both money and respect. Sometimes the line can
suggest a kind of masochistic petulance in your attitude toward the Work. Note: Oracle
interpretation must always remain open and flexible. A recent receipt of this line reversed
56 -- Transition -- 56

its usual syntax to portray a situation in which the “Inn set on fire” referred to an
organization which lost a faithful servant (the querent-employee) through unethical
business practices. Always allow your best intuition to recognize the best fit for the
symbolism, particularly if an answer doesn’t seem to make sense. Try inverting the
situation to see if that works better – if so, the answer will usually be numinous.

The arrogant heart is abhorrent to Yahweh,
be sure it will not go unpunished.
Proverbs 16: 5

A. A position is undermined and support is lost because of arrogance.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows the traveler in a resting place, having also the
means of livelihood and the axe, but still saying: "I am not at ease in my mind."

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wanderer rests in a shelter. He obtains his property and an ax.
My heart is not glad.

Blofeld: The traveler reaches a place where he obtains the money needed for his
expenses, yet laments that there is no joy in his heart. [Were we to travel or continue to
travel now, though material difficulties would not arise, we should not experience any
happiness.]

Liu: The exile finds rest in a sanctuary. He regains his valuables. He is not happy in his
heart.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sojourning, tending-towards abiding. Acquiring one's own emblem-
ax. My heart not keen.

Shaughnessy: In traveling, staying put, he gets his goods and ax; my heart is not happy.

Cleary (1): Traveling in the right place, one obtains resources and tools, but one’s heart is
not happy.

Wu: The traveler rests in his lodge. He has the amenities, but he is not at ease.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Although in a resting place, he has not got his proper position. Even
with a livelihood and an axe his mind is not at ease. Wilhelm/Baynes: He has not yet
obtained his place. He is not yet glad at heart. Blofeld: His wandering to that place is
indicated by the unsuitable position of this line; his obtaining money for expenses brings
him no joy. Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet acquiring the situation indeed. The heart not-yet
56 -- Transition -- 56

keen indeed. Cleary (2): One has not gotten a position. One’s heart is not yet happy. Wu:
His position is improper. He is still not at ease.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but in a magnetic place. Hence, although he is without a
lodging-house, he does have a shelter which is not very secure. He can use the axe for
defense, but is still uneasy in his mind. The K'ang-hsi editors observe that the mention of
the axe makes us think of caution as a quality desirable in a wanderer.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Although the inferior man finds a resting place and a means of livelihood, his
aspirations are greater than his capabilities. He remains ill at ease, a stranger in a strange
environment.

Wing: Though you are on your way toward the attainment of your goals, you are
constantly aware that you have not arrived. This state of mind leaves you feeling uneasy --
knowing you must move on, and yet anxious to protect and hold intact that which you
have already accomplished.

Editor: Here the wanderer is "camping out," so to speak -- occupying a temporary
position during a transition. The axe, analogous to the sword (or any metallic cutting
instrument), can symbolize mental discrimination. (Cf. The suit of swords in the Tarot.)
The image is of one who has the power to comprehend his situation and the resources to
advance to a new position, yet is still in a very tenuous and ill-defined state of being. The
issue could go either way.

This realization is extremely important from a practical standpoint, for it implies
that only constant attention to the unconscious, an inner devoted tribute, is
sufficient to enlist its cooperation. The unconscious realms cannot be analyzed
away, cannot be defeated in battle, but, at best, by conscious confrontation, can be
taken into account within the limits of one's individual capacity.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. A synthesis is only tentative -- gains are vulnerable to loss.

B. Consolidate and defend your position. You have all you need, but could lose it.

C. An incomplete idea or concept needs nourishment and careful discrimination to
make it secure.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject shooting a pheasant. She will lose her
arrow, but in the end she will obtain praise and a high charge.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Wilhelm/Baynes: He shoots a pheasant. It drops with the first arrow. In the end this
brings both praise and office.

Blofeld: While pheasant shooting, he loses an arrow. In the end he wins praise and
attains to office. [After suffering a small loss, we shall receive considerable benefits from
those above us.]

Liu: He shoots a pheasant, losing one arrow. In the end he gains honor and position.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shooting a pheasant. The-one arrow extinguishing. Completing uses
praising fate.

Shaughnessy: Shooting the pheasant, one arrow is gone; in the winter he is thereby
presented a command.

Cleary (1): Shooting a pheasant, one arrow is lost; eventually one is entitled, because of
good repute.

Cleary (2): ... Ultimately one is lauded and given a mandate.

Wu: He shoots a pheasant, but loses an arrow. Eventually he receives a conferment of
praise.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has reached a high place. Wilhelm/Baynes: In the end he rises
through praise and office. Blofeld: Both of these are bestowed from above. Ritsema/
Karcher: Overtaking the above indeed. Cleary (2): Reaching the highest. Wu:
“Eventually he receives a conferment of praise” from his superior.

Legge: Although magnetic, the fifth line is in the center of the upper trigram of Clarity
and Intelligence. She is the ruler of the trigram and the dynamic fourth and sixth lines
loyally defend and help her. She shoots a pheasant. When an officer was traveling abroad
in ancient times, the gift of introduction at any feudal court was a pheasant. The wanderer
is here praised by her friends and exalted to a place of dignity by the ruler to whom she is
acceptable. Note that the idea of the fifth line being the ruler's seat is dropped here as
being alien to the idea of the hexagram.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man succeeds in his task and receives the recognition and praise of his friends.
They recommend him to the prince, who accepts his services in a highly responsible
position.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Wing: It may be that you must establish a place for yourself in altogether new territory.
Be mindful of your approach. Modesty and generosity in the beginning will be rewarded
with position and acceptance. Success is indicated.

Editor: There is some ambiguity in the various interpretations of this line. Some say that
the fifth line is the seat of the ruler, though the logic of the symbolism suggests that since
the ruler bestows favors on the subject of the line, he must be elsewhere. Wilhelm says
that line four represents the wanderer's friends, and line six represents the high place to
which she is promoted. As a bird, the pheasant is a creature of air, or mental realm, hence
symbolic of an idea, concept or thought. Here the thought is given (sacrificed) to the ruler
or Self. The arrow here suggests aspiration or intent: to perceive a goal or target (the
pheasant) and make it one's own. However, the arrow is lost, and the quarry is given to
the ruler in a gesture of fealty. In the end this results in a reward for the wanderer. All of
these images suggest a kind of willing sacrifice which one may not completely understand,
but which will eventually result in an ample reward.

Intellectually the Self is no more than a psychological concept, a construct that
serves to express an unknowable essence which we cannot grasp as such, since by
definition it transcends our powers of comprehension. It might equally well be
called the "God within us." The beginnings of our whole psychic life seem to be
inextricably rooted in this point, and all our highest and ultimate purposes seem
to be striving towards it.
Jung -- Two Essays on Analytical Psychology

A. Your aspiration exceeds your comprehension. Sacrifice a small reward now and
receive a big one later on.

B. Sacrifice your need to understand. Have faith in the Work.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, suggests the idea of a bird burning its nest. The stranger,
thus represented, first laughs and then cries out. He has lost his ox-like docility too readily
and easily. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The bird's nest burns up. The wanderer laughs at first, then must
needs lament and weep. Through carelessness he loses his cow. Misfortune.

Blofeld: A bird manages to burn its own nest. At first the traveler laughs, but then has
cause to shout and weep. A cow is lost through carelessness -- misfortune! [Presumably,
someone's carelessness causes him misfortune which excites our mirth -- until we
discover that we ourselves are deeply involved in the resulting loss.]

Liu: A bird's nest burns. The exile laughs in the beginning, laments later. He loses his cow
by being careless. Misfortune.
56 -- Transition -- 56

Ritsema/Karcher: A bird burning its nest. Sojourning people beforehand laughing,
afterwards crying-out sobbing. Losing the cattle, tending-towards versatility. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: A crow disorders its nest; the traveler first laughs and later weeps and
wails, losing an ox at Yi; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): A bird turns (Sic) its nest. The traveler first laughs, afterward cries. Losing the
ox at the border, there is misfortune.

Cleary (2): ... Losing the cow while at ease is unfortunate.

Wu: Like a bird burning its own nest, the traveler first laughs with joy and then howls in
sorrow. Like losing a cow in the field, it is foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He would not listen to the truth about the course to be pursued.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Being at the top as a wanderer rightly leads to being burnt up. In the
end he hears nothing. Blofeld: The top of this hexagram signifies burning. The loss of a
cow through carelessness means that no news will ever be obtained of something we have
lost (or are about to lose). Ritsema/Karcher: Using Sojourning to locate- in the above.
One's righteousness burning indeed. Completing absolutely-nothing: having hearing
indeed. Cleary (2): Because the travel is in a high place, it is just to be destroyed. After all
one does not listen. Wu: Traveling at this top position amounts to burning oneself. The
misfortune of losing a cow in the field is something he has not heard of.

Legge: Line six is dynamic in a magnetic place at the outer limit of the trigram of Clarity -

    he will be arrogant and violent, the opposite of what a wanderer should be, and the issue
    will be evil. Humility cannot co-exist with haughty arrogance, and his careless self-
    sufficiency has shut his mind against all the lessons of wisdom.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The newcomer becomes careless, imprudent, and violent at the height of his
distinction.

Wing: By losing yourself in the drama of a new situation and by involving yourself in
details that have nothing whatsoever to do with the development of your own principles,
you detach yourself from the very foundation of your original aims. Misfortune.

Editor: A bird, as a creature of the air, the realm of thought, can symbolize an idea or
concept. A nest suggests the foundation, or resting place of a thought -- a necessary
premise upon which the thought is founded. To burn up a necessary premise, foundation,
or whatever, suggests thought that has transcended the bounds of reality -- i.e., fantasy, or
illusion. If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number sixty-two, Small
Powers, the corresponding line of which also images a bird transcending its proper
56 -- Transition -- 56

bounds. The wanderer here is arrogant, and as Legge points out, "carelessly self-
sufficient." The line sometimes implies some harsh truths about an overly intellectual
approach to life.

An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but its
own existence. It is incapable of learning from the past, incapable of
understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right conclusions
about the future. It is hypnotized by itself and therefore cannot be argued with. It
inevitably dooms itself to calamities that must strike it dead.
Jung -- Psychology and Alchemy

A. Criminal negligence creates an irretrievable loss.

B. Image of a stupid idea.

57 -- Penetration -- 57
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-SEVEN --
PENETRATION

Other titles: The Gentle, The Penetrating, Wind, The Symbol of Bending to Enter,
Willing Submission, Gentle Penetration, Ground, Calculations, Complaisance, Penetrating
Influence, The Penetration of the Wind, Humility, Devoted Service, Submission

Judgment

Legge: Penetration indicates modest success. See the great man and move in the
direction that implies.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Gentle. Success through what is small. It furthers one to have
somewhere to go. It furthers one to see the great man.

Blofeld: Willing Submission -- success in small matters. It is advantageous to have in
view a goal (or destination) and to visit a great man. [This is a reasonably auspicious
hexagram; it augurs a certain amount of success for those who submit to circumstances -

    unless a moving line indicating the contrary is received. This is not a time for resistance
    but for submission.]

Liu: Penetration. Small success. It is beneficial to go somewhere. It is beneficial to see a
great man.

Ritsema/Karcher: Ground, the small: Growing. Harvesting: possessing directed going.
Harvesting: visualizing Great People. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms
of providing an underlying support. It emphasizes that subtly penetrating and
nourishing things from below, the action of Ground, is the adequate way to handle it. To
be in accord with the time, you are told to enter the situation from below!]

Shaughnessy: Calculations: Little receipt; beneficial to have someplace to go;
beneficial to see the great man.

Cleary (1): Wind is small but developmental. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go. It
is beneficial to see a great man.

Cleary (2): The small comes through successfully. It is beneficial to have a place to go.
It is beneficial to see great people.

Wu: Complaisance indicates that the small are pervasive. It is advantageous to have
undertakings. It is also advantageous to see the great man.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

The Image

Legge: Two wind trigrams following each other form Penetration. The superior man
proclaims his commands and undertakes his work.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Winds following one upon the other: the image of the gently
penetrating. Thus the superior man spreads his commands abroad and carries out his
undertakings.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes a favorable wind. The Superior Man performs his
allotted tasks in consonance with heaven's (or the sovereign's) will. [The component
trigrams combine the concepts of wind and blandness -- hence a favorable wind.]

Liu: Wind following wind symbolizes Penetration. The superior man proclaims his
directives and executes his affairs.

Ritsema/Karcher: Following winds. Ground. A chun tzu uses distributing fate to move
affairs.

Cleary (1): Wind following wind. Thus do superior people articulate directions and carry
out tasks.

Wu: One breeze follows the other; this is Complaisance. Thus the jun zi gives further
injunctions in order to administer public affairs.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Repeated wind trigrams show the repetition of governmental orders.
The dynamic fifth line has penetrated to his correct central place and carries his will into
action. The magnetic first and fourth lines obey the dynamic lines above
them. Hence it is said that there will be success in small matters.

Legge: Penetration symbolizes both wind and wood, and has the attributes of Docility,
Flexibility and Penetration. We are to think of it as wind with its penetrating power which
finds its way into every nook and cranny.

Confucius said: "The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that
between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it." In
accordance with this, the hexagram must be understood as the influence and orders of the
government designed to remedy what is wrong in the people. The upper trigram denotes
the orders issuing from the ruler, and the lower the obedience rendered to them by the
people.

Ch'eng-tzu says: "Superiors, in harmony with the duty of inferiors, issue their
commands; inferiors, in harmony with the wishes of their superiors, follow them. Above
and below there are that harmony and deference; and this is the significance of the
redoubled Wind trigram. When governmental commands and business are in
57 -- Penetration -- 57

accordance with what is right, they agree with the tendencies of the minds of the people
who follow them."

Anthony: Getting this hexagram often refers to the presence of inferior elements that
obstruct our having a good influence ... Because this hexagram is concerned with self-
correction, we often get it together with Work on What has been Spoiled. [Hex. 18:
Repair.]

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Get to the heart of the matter and act on the information obtained.

The Superior Man acts on his understanding by implementing it in the world.

The hexagram of Penetration, made up of two trigrams symbolizing Wind (which
is air in motion), suggests the activity of thought (the realm of air) trying to comprehend
or "penetrate" something. Thus, each line of the figure may be seen as some aspect of an
act of mental endeavor.

Therefore the student must exert his own mind to the utmost. If he does so, he will
know his own nature. And if he knows his own nature, examines his own self and
makes it sincere, he becomes a sage. Therefore the "Great Norm" says, "The virtue
of thinking is penetration and profundity ... Penetration and profundity lead to
sageness.”
-- Ch'eng I

The first line depicts vacillation and indecisiveness; the second shows one trying to
"get to the bottom" of a matter. Line three is an image of futile hypothesizing; four and
five show two aspects of successful comprehension, and the sixth line symbolizes an
inability to understand.

Man's intellect -- the greatest but most dangerous gift he has received from God --
builds a bridge across the seemingly unconquerable chasm between that which is
personal and mortal and that which is impersonal and eternal. Through man's
intellect he succumbed to the temptation to fall out of divine unity with his
consciousness. But by the same token, his intellect gives him the possibility of
bringing back his consciousness into full union with divinity. By means of his
intellect, man is able to understand truth, and when he has understood, he will
seek and keep on seeking and trying until he some day succeeds in finding the only
path to the realization of his self.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

The hexagram can also symbolize humble submission and devoted service, thus
suggesting the role of the ego in the Work. To truly comprehend the nature of the Work is
to serve it with devotion. There are some interesting associations between the act of
penetration and that of submission – when dynamic and magnetic are in full harmony
they lose their individual identities and become one force which is both and neither.
57 -- Penetration -- 57
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject now advancing, now retreating. It
would be advantageous for her to have the firm correctness of a brave soldier.

Wilhelm/Baynes: In advancing and retreating, the perseverance of a warrior furthers.

Blofeld: Advancing and retreating; the righteous persistence of the warriors brings
advantage.

Liu: Advance and retreat. It benefits the military person to be firm.

Ritsema/Karcher: Advancing, withdrawing. Martial people's Harvesting Trial.

Shaughnessy: Entering the inside; beneficial for a military man's determination.

Cleary (1): Advancing and retreating. It is beneficial to be steadfast like a soldier.

Wu: There is hesitation. It will be advantageous to have the perseverance of a soldier.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her mind is perplexed. If she had the will of a brave soldier her mind
would be well-governed. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will wavers. The will is controlled.
Blofeld: The first three words imply that we have doubts about our own intentions. The
rest of the passage suggests a will firmly under control. [Probably the implication is that
we are now too hesitant and that we should benefit from acquiring the strong
determination exhibited by soldiers in combat.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Purpose doubted
indeed. Purpose regulated indeed. Cleary (2): The mind is wavering. The mind is under
control. Wu: Hesitation implies doubts in the mind. The perseverance of a soldier
indicates a determination to carry out orders.

Legge: Line one is magnetic where it should be dynamic. Her movements are perplexed
because she lacks vigor and decision.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is perplexed and drifts indecisively. A resolute military
discipline is required of him.

Wing: Do not be indecisive and perplexed. If you drift about with an undisciplined
attitude, nothing can be influenced. Make a decision and stick to it.

Editor: The image is of vacillation, indecisiveness and lack of will. The only remedy is to
assume our responsibilities to the Work with the same will and spirit that we associate
with the samurai warrior.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior. Today is
victory over yourself of yesterday.
Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. Take a realistic, tough-minded approach to the matter at hand.

B. Indecisiveness, uncertainty, anxiety, confusion.

C. Your question suggests a lack of commitment to the Work.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows penetration under a bed, and one employing
diviners and exorcists in a way bordering on confusion. There will be good fortune and no
error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Penetration under the bed. Priests and magicians are used in great
number. Good fortune. No blame.

Blofeld: Crawling below the bed. He employs the services of a disorderly rabble of
diviners and wizards -- good fortune and no error! [This could be taken to refer to the lines
of the hexagram up to this point, for this one is much more favorable than those (sic)
preceding it. Or it may be taken to mean that affairs which begin by going ill with us will
later take a change greatly for the better.]

Liu: Wind under the bed. Many fortune-tellers and witches are used. Good fortune. No
blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Ground located below the bed. Availing-of chroniclers, shamans. The
mottled like significant. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Calculations are under the bed, herewith causing the magicians to be
indignant-like; auspicious; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Obedient in the basement, frequently employing intermediaries, leads to good
fortune, without blame.

Cleary (2): Obedience below the platform, using scribes and mediums frequently, etc.

Wu: He acts so agreeably as if he were under the bed. If he could use the sincerity of an
augur to make himself understood, it would be auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is due to the position of the line in the center.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Wilhelm/Baynes: One has attained the middle. Blofeld: Good fortune is indicated by
the position of this line, which is central to the lower trigram. Ritsema/Karcher:
Acquiring the center indeed. Cleary (2): The attainment of balance. Wu: His central
position.

Legge: Line two is dynamic in the central place of the lower trigram. The K'ang-hsi
editors explain that something is hidden beneath a couch or bed, and the subject of the
line searches for it. He relies on divination to assist his judgment, and exorcism to expel
what is bad. The work is great and difficult, and he appears almost distracted by it. The
sincerity of purpose indicated by his central position leads him to the right course, despite
the many considerations that might distract him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Undesirable influences from hidden quarters adversely affect the man's progress.
They must be indefatigably traced to their darkest sources and exposed. This will eliminate
their power over people.

Wing: Hidden motives, weaknesses, or prejudices are buried deeply within the situation
and influence it. These must be ferreted out into the light of day and dispensed with. Once
this is done, your aims can be accomplished.

Editor: Wind is air in motion, hence symbolic of thought. When the ideas of "thought"
and "penetration" are combined we get an image of the process of comprehension. Trying
to comprehend something "under a bed" suggests that which lies beneath a sleeping place,
beneath consciousness: hence, trying to understand hidden or unconscious forces. To do
this, one employs "exorcists and diviners" -- uses the oracle, studies dreams, etc.
Although our method borders on confusion (we are not entirely accurate in our
comprehension), we are on the right track, and eventual success is indicated. Sometimes
there is a hint here that we may be making things more complicated than necessary.

The means of destruction of ignorance is unbroken practice of discrimination.
Patanjali

A. Delving into the unconscious, one seeks comprehension of that which is hidden.

B. You are confused in your understanding of the matter at hand -- look beneath the
surface and figure it out.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject penetrating only by violent and repeated
efforts. There will be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Repeated penetration. Humiliation.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Blofeld: Repeated submission -- shame!

Liu: Orders repeated many times. Humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Imminent Ground, abashment.

Shaughnessy: Sequenced calculation; distress.

Cleary(1): Redundant obedience is humiliating.

Cleary(2): Repeatedly attempting obedience is humiliating.

Wu: He tries repeatedly to be obliging but he fails. This is humiliating.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This shows exhaustion of the will. Wilhelm/Baynes: The will
exhausts itself. Blofeld: Shame resulting from the exhaustion of our will-power.
Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose exhausted indeed. Cleary (2): The aim is frustrated.
Wu: The humiliation from trying repeatedly to be obliging results from losing his bearing.

Legge: Line three is in the right place for a dynamic line, but his position at the top of the
trigram indicates his restlessness bordering on vehemence. The sixth line is not a proper
correlate, and all the striving is ineffective. The exhausted will is the result of his repeated
efforts which have worn him out. He can now only regret his failures.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man deliberates repeatedly about the same issues, thereby generating fresh
scruples and doubts. His striving is ineffective.

Wing: People who indulge too much in the deliberation of an issue, its possible outcomes
and other such fantasies lose their initiative and their ability to influence. This brings
humiliation.

Editor: The image is an unambiguous one of trying to force something. Sometimes the
line can suggest a masochistic obsession with negativity.

It is bad to repeat the same thing several times when fighting the enemy. There
may be no help but to do something twice, but do not try it a third time. If you
once make an attack and fail, there is little chance of success if you use the same
approach again. If you attempt a technique which you have previously tried
unsuccessfully and fail yet again, then you must change your attacking method.
Miyamoto Musashi -- A Book of Five Rings

A. You are trying too hard to succeed.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

B. Extreme measures exhaust the will.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows all occasion for repentance in its subject passed
away. She takes game for its threefold use in her hunting.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Remorse vanishes. During the hunt three kinds of game are caught.

Blofeld: Regret vanishes! Three kinds of game are caught in the field.

Liu: Remorse disappears. One catches three kinds of game while hunting.

Ritsema/Karcher: Repenting extinguished. The fields, catching three kinds.

Shaughnessy: Regret is gone. In the fields bagging three types.

Cleary(1) Regret vanishes. The yield of the field is of three grades.

Cleary(2) Regret vanishes. The hunt yields three catches.

Wu: Regret no more. He hunts and bags three kinds of game.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She achieves merit. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is meritorious.
Blofeld: The second sentence augurs concrete results. Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing
achievement indeed. Cleary (2) There is success. Wu: He has succeeded.

Legge: Line four is magnetic, as is her correlate in line one, but four is a proper place for a
magnetic line, and it rests under the shadow of the dynamic and central fifth line. Hence
the omens of evil are counteracted, and a good auspice is obtained. The game caught in
hunting was divided into three portions -- the first for use in sacrifices, the second for the
entertainment of visitors, and the third for the kitchen generally. A hunt which yielded
enough for all these purposes was deemed very successful.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man gains praise by counteracting evil. He can now meet his needs for offerings
to the gods, for everyday use, and for guests.

Wing: Energetic action will yield successful results. You will be able to satisfy all your
needs if you modestly yet confidently confront your adversaries.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Anthony: In finding and being resolute against evil in ourself, we have solved all the
problems facing us at the moment, which seemed to be totally unrelated. This is the
meaning of "three kinds of game."

Editor: Three is a number symbolizing the reconciliation of opposites in a new entity:
thesis, antithesis and synthesis. It also suggests the unconscious, conscious and super-
conscious realms of the psyche. A hunt is a quest, and game is nourishment:
psychologically, the insights gained from the quest. In combination, the symbols describe
a nourishing synthesis and the implication is that you are "sitting pretty." Perhaps your
penetration into the matter at hand has produced some fresh understanding.

Will is the grand agent in the mystic progress; its rule is all potent over the
nervous system ... Yet there is not One Will, but three Wills -- the Wills, namely, of
the Divine, the Rational and Irrational Souls -- to harmonize these is the difficulty.
W.W. Westcott -- The Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster

A. An image of integration, reconciliation, consolidation.

B. Congratulations -- you've just comprehended a complex issue.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows that with firm correctness there will be good
fortune to its subject. All occasion for repentance will disappear, and all his movements
will be advantageous. There may have been no good beginning, but there will be a good
end. Three days before making any changes, let him give notice of them; and three days
after, let him reconsider them. There will thus be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse vanishes. Nothing that
does not further. No beginning, but an end. Before the change, three days. After the
change, three days. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings reward; regret vanishes, and everything
is favorable! A poor beginning, but a good end! The three days before and the three days
after a change (now due to occur) are especially propitious.

Liu: Firmness -- good fortune. Remorse disappears. Everything is of benefit. Loss in the
beginning, gain in the end. Three days before change. Three days after change. Good
fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant, repenting extinguished. Without not Harvesting.
Without initially possessing completion. Before husking, three days. After husking, three
days. Significant.
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious; regret is gone; there is nothing not
beneficial; there is no beginning, there is an end. Preceding the geng day by three days,
following the geng day by three days; auspicious.

Cleary (1): It is good to be correct; regret vanishes. There is all-around benefit. There is
no beginning, but there is an end. The last three days of the lunar cycle and the first three
days of the lunar cycle are auspicious.

Cleary (2): Correctness leads to good fortune; regret vanishes, none do not benefit.
There is no beginning, but there is an end. The three days before a change and the
three days after a change are auspicious.

Wu: Perseverance brings good fortune. Regret has gone. Every undertaking will be
advantageous. The beginning may be rough, but the end will be great. It will be auspicious
between three days before the change and three days thereafter.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is owing to his correct position in the center.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is correct and central. Blofeld: That we shall enjoy good
fortune is indicated by the correct position of this line in the center of the upper trigram.
Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correctly centered indeed. Cleary (2): Its position is
correctly balanced. Correctly balanced. Wu: The position is correct and central.

Legge: Ch'eng-tzu says that line five is the seat of honor for the lord of the hexagram,
from whom issue all charges and commands. It is central and correct and exemplifies the
qualities of the figure in the highest mode. These qualities are docility and conformance to
what is right, and the advantage of firm correctness is insisted upon. With this, all will be
right. Compare the concluding image with the Judgment of hexagram number eighteen,
Repair.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Continued integrity on the part of the man compensates for his poor beginning.
However, prior to the change the man needs to ponder carefully. After the change, he
needs to check his results.

Wing: If you wish to accomplish your aims and change the situation, you must continue
your vigilance and influence. Although the beginning has problems, the end will bring
good fortune. Yet even after the change is made, you should periodically evaluate the
results.

Editor: If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number eighteen, Repair,
or Work on What Has Been Spoiled, the Judgment of which is nearly identical to this line.
This suggests that the penetration involved in the matter at hand is concerned with the
rectification of a past error. The key ideas in the line are: Firm correctness brings good
fortune: Willpower is the cornerstone of the Work. Poor beginning vs. good end:
57 -- Penetration -- 57

Describes a sequence of events in which a situation is improved over time -- a process of
repair. Three days before/after: A turning point, a moment of choice or decision which is
consciously monitored. (This one-week sequence is a useful timetable for natural birth
control: i.e., celibacy three days before, during, and after the calculated day of fertility.
Obviously, willpower is essential for success.)

But as when an authentic watch is shown,
Each man winds up and rectifies his own,
So in our very judgments.
Sir John Suckling

A. Well-considered action, carried out with firm intent, will correct an earlier error
and create the conditions for beneficial change.

B. You have perceived the problem -- now rectify it.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows penetration beneath a bed, and its subject having
lost the axe with which he executed his decisions. However firm and correct he may try to
be, there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Penetration under the bed. He loses his property and his ax.
Perseverance brings misfortune.

Blofeld: Crawling below the bed. [This symbolizes exaggerated submission, servile
humility, etc. Apparently, we have been guilty of this fault.] He loses what is required for
his traveling expenses -- persistence brings misfortune!

Liu: Wind under the bed. He loses his wealth. Continuing leads to misfortune. [This line
indicates possible loss or sickness.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Ground located below the bed. Losing one's own emblem-ax. Trial:
pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Calculations are under the bed; losing his goods and ax; determination is
inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Obedient under the floor, one loses one’s resources; even if faithful, there is
misfortune.

Cleary (2): The obedient are below the platform. Losing resources and tools, it is proper
that there be misfortune.

Wu: He acts so agreeably as if he were under the bed. He loses his means of supporting
and protecting himself. Even with perseverance it is foreboding.
57 -- Penetration -- 57
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Though occupying the topmost place, his powers are exhausted.
Though he tries to be correct, there will be evil. Wilhelm/Baynes: At the top, the end
has come. Is this right? It brings misfortune. Blofeld: This top line indicates exhaustion
of all possibilities. Losing his traveling expenses presages certain misfortune! Ritsema/
Karcher: Above exhaustion indeed. Correcting reaching a pitfall indeed. Cleary (2):
Above there is an impasse. It is proper that there be misfortune. Wu: He has reached his
limit. It is definitely foreboding.

Legge: The evil that line six concludes with arises from the quality of gentle penetration
being carried to excess.

Anthony: Sometimes a diligent search for the hidden enemy reveals nothing specific. In
getting this line, we should let go of the search. In sincerely seeking, our attitude has been
corrected of careless overconfidence; that is enough.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man appreciates the underlying problem and traces the injurious influence to its
ultimate origin. However, he lacks the power to overcome it and is hurt in the process.

Wing: By attempting to penetrate all the myriad possibilities of the situation, you have
dissipated the energy to influence. Great understanding means little without decisive
action. Negativity can no longer be prevented.

Editor: As in line two, "penetration" is comprehension, and "beneath a bed" suggests the
unconscious realms of the psyche. "Penetration under the bed" is an attempt to
understand the unknown. An axe is a metal cutting instrument with associations in
common with the sword and arrow: that is, the discriminating mental faculty; intellect,
scientific method, etc. To lose one's axe is to be without the ability to differentiate the
components of an unknown situation. The line implies that you are asking questions
beyond your capacity to understand; or you are asking the wrong questions; or the oracle
is tired of your importunate questioning entirely: the "gentle penetration is being carried
to excess." In the latter case, we are reminded of the Judgment in hexagram number 4,
Inexperience: "I do not seek the inexperienced youth, but he seeks me. When he shows
the sincerity proper for divination, I instruct him. If he asks two or three times, that is
troublesome, and I do not instruct the troublesome."

Some (schools) claim that the way to enlightenment consists in holding dialogues
with the archetypes, fantasy figures of the objective psyche, surrounding yourself
with the personified projections of your mind in the form of "higher selves" and
"inner guides." ... The "new age" optimism and superficiality of those who reduce
the dark mysteries of Jung's Gnosis to the shallow level of their own limitations
are apt to make people into the victims of the very unconscious they tend to treat
so lightly. Those who naively wish to use the archetypes for their personalistic

57 -- Penetration -- 57

ends will be made subject to their cruel tyranny.
S.A. Hoeller -- The Gnostic Jung

A. You are fumbling in the dark.

B. Confused thinking or compulsive speculation cripples intuition.

June 3, 2001, 4/25/06
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-EIGHT --
JOY (SELF-INDULGENCE)

Other titles: The Joyous, Joyousness, Pleased Satisfaction, Encouraging, Delight, Open,
Usurpation, Self-indulgence, Pleasure, Cheerfulness, Frivolity, Callow Optimism

Judgment

Legge: Joy intimates that under its conditions there will be progress and attainment, but
it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Joyous. Success. Perseverance is favorable.

Blofeld: Joy -- success! Persistence in a righteous course brings reward.

Liu: Joyousness. Success. Continuance is favorable.

Ritsema/Karcher: Open, Growing. Harvesting Trial. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of interaction and exchange. It emphasizes that stimulating things
through cheering and persuasive speech, the action of Open, is the adequate way to
handle it. To be in accord with the time, you are told to: stimulate!]

Shaughnessy: Usurpation: Receipt; a little beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): Joy is developmental, beneficial if correct. [This hexagram represents joy in
practicing the Tao. Having one’s will in the Tao is finding joy in the Tao; when one
delights in the Tao, then one can practice the Tao. This is why Joy is developmental.]

Cleary (2): Delight comes through, beneficial if correct.

Wu: Joy indicates pervasiveness. It is advantageous to be persevering.

The Image

Legge: Two images of the waters of a marsh, one over the other, form Joy. The superior
man, in accordance with this, encourages the conversation of friends and the stimulus of
their common practice.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Lakes resting one on the other: the image of The Joyous. Thus the
superior man joins with his friends for discussion and practice.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes two bodies of water conjoined. The Superior Man
joins his friends in discussions and in practicing the various arts and virtues.

Liu: The beautiful lakes symbolize Joyousness. The superior man joins his fellows for
teaching and study.

Ritsema/Karcher: Congregating marshes. Open. A chun tzu uses partnering friends to
explicate repeating.

Cleary (1): Joined lakes are joyful. Thus do superior people explain and practice with
companions. [As water provides moisture for myriad beings, joy develops myriad
beings; joyful within and without, reaching the outer from within, communicating with
the inner from without, inside and outside are conjoined, without separation between
them – therefore it is called joy.]

Cleary (2): ... Thus do developed people study and practice with companions.

Wu: One marsh is adjacent to another; this is Joy. Thus the jun zi discusses and
exchanges ideas with friends.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Joy has the meaning of Pleased Satisfaction. We have the dynamic
lines in the center and the magnetic lines on the outer edge of the two trigrams, indicating
that in pleasure what is most advantageous is the maintenance of firm correctness.
Through this there will be found an accordance with the will of heaven, and a
correspondence with the feelings of men. When such pleasure goes before the people, and
leads them on, they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering difficulties,
they forget the risk of death. How great is the power of this Pleased Satisfaction,
stimulating in such a way the people!

Legge: The feeling of pleasure is the subject of this hexagram, which is made up of the
doubled trigram of Cheerfulness, or Pleased Satisfaction. The progress and attainment of
the figure are due to the one magnetic line surmounting each trigram and supported by
the two dynamic lines. The idea is that of mildness which is energized by a double portion
of strength.

The pleasure which leads the people to endure toil and risk death is the effect of the
instructive example of their ruler. Fu Fan-hsien paraphrases this portion of the text as:
"When the sage with this precedes them, he can make them endure toil without any wish
to decline it, and go with him into difficulty and danger without their having any fear."

Anthony: This hexagram speaks, on the one hand, of that on which true joy depends, and
on the other, of joy as desire, which leads to conflict. The essence of true joy is inner
stability. Being firmly devoted to our path, we do not waver. When we think of the soft and
comfortable path, on the other hand, self-conflict begins. Therefore, getting this hexagram
indicates that we may be wavering or irresolute.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: A cheerful attitude serves the will.

The Superior Man shares his thoughts and feelings. [Or, psychologically interpreted:
observes, weighs and integrates his thoughts with his feelings.]

The title of this hexagram denotes joyousness and pleasure, and most people regard
it as a good omen when they receive it. Yet, an analysis of the lines indicates that only the
first two are particularly favorable, and the hexagram itself seldom seems to refer to
anything remotely resembling “Joy” in a typical oracle consultation. The lessons to be
learned from the figure are the differences between self-indulgence and maintaining
emotional stability in one's conduct of the Work, which always demands a firm control
over one’s affects. To receive this hexagram without changing lines requires the querent's
careful discrimination -- it can mean simply: "Oh happy day!" Or, it can suggest that you
examine an inclination toward lack of control in the situation at hand. The oracle is
capable of brutal sarcasm when your query warrants it, so don't be too quick to accept the
shallow meaning of Joy – as often as not, Self-indulgence is the more appropriate title.

In light frivolity, the center is lost; in hasty action, self-mastery is lost.
Lao Tse

The Image depicts an open interchange among “friends.” Intrapsychically, this
suggests the normal give and take between thoughts and feelings for the purpose of
reaching integration. The symbol of “two bodies of water conjoined” (Blofeld) might refer
to the adjacent dimensions of thought and emotion within the psyche. When feelings are
not in harmony with intellectual differentiation (a common phenomenon), give and take
(“discussion and practice”), is essential to effect integration: i.e., harmony, or “joy.”
"Practice" suggests cycles of time, and the notion that perfection is still to be achieved.

Shaughnessy’s seemingly anomalous title of Usurpation for this hexagram offers
some subtle insights into the symbolism here. Emotions, feelings, affects, are often
portrayed as daemonic forces which “usurp” ego consciousness and indulge themselves in
the “joy” of expressing whatever they happen to represent in the psyche. This is often what
is implied when receiving this hexagram.

Each of us is equipped with a psychic disposition that limits our freedom in high
degree and makes it practically illusory. Not only is "freedom of the will" an
incalculable problem philosophically, it is also a misnomer in the practical sense,
for we seldom find anybody who is not influenced and indeed dominated by
desires, habits, impulses, prejudices, resentments, and by every conceivable kind
of complex. All these natural facts function exactly like an Olympus full of deities
who want to be propitiated, served, feared and worshipped, not only by the
individual owner of this assorted pantheon, but by everybody in his vicinity.
Jung -- Psychology and Religion

58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Cleary’s Taoist commentary: “As water provides moisture for myriad beings, etc.,”
supports this interpretation. Water symbolizes the emotional realm, and the “myriad
beings” dwelling therein are emotional entities: creatures like untamed animals, which are
never happier than when running free. To them it’s Joy; to the executive function in the
psyche, it’s Self-indulgence. Usurpation has taken place.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows the pleasure of inward harmony. There will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contented joyousness. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Harmonious joy -- good fortune!

Liu: Harmonious joyousness -- good fortune!

Ritsema/Karcher: Harmonious Opening, significant.

Shaughnessy: Beneficent usurpation; auspicious.

Cleary (1): The joy of harmony is good.

Cleary (2): Harmonious delight is auspicious.

Wu: There is joy in harmony, Auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This arises from there being nothing in the conduct of the subject of
the line to awaken doubt. Wilhelm/Baynes: One's way has not yet become doubtful.
Blofeld: This indicates our being able to act without being troubled by doubts.
Ritsema/Karcher: Movement not-yet doubted indeed. Cleary (2): Action is not
doubted. Wu: Absence of doubt.

Legge: Line one, dynamic in a dynamic place with no proper correlate above, is self-
sufficient. He has as yet taken no action and there is therefore no cause for suspicion.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man lives in quiet, self-contained joy.

Wing: A contented assurance about your path and principles leads to good fortune. With
such an attitude, you do not need to rely upon external circumstances for your happiness.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Editor: The image here suggests a cheerful self-sufficiency in the matter at hand; in some
sense the situation is obvious and under control. "Inward harmony" might relate to
unconscious dynamics unavailable to conscious awareness.

If the individual mind is one with the Universal Mind, and if the possessor of the
individual mind wishes to find out some secret of Nature, he does not require to
seek for it outside of the sphere of his mind, but he looks for it in himself, because
everything that exists in Nature (which is a manifestation of the Universal Mind)
exists in, and is reflected by himself, and the idea of there being two minds is only
an illusion; the two are one.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

A. Have a simple faith in the unfolding of the Work and cheerfully accept the status
quo.

B. "Don't worry. Be happy."

C. Inner harmony is sufficient unto itself.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows the pleasure arising from inward stability. There
will be good fortune. Occasion for repentance will disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Sincere joyousness. Good fortune. Remorse disappears.

Blofeld: Confident joy -- good fortune and absence of regret!

Liu: Truthful joyousness. Good fortune. Remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Conforming Opening, significant. Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: Sincere usurpation; auspicious; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): The joy of truthfulness is good. Regret vanishes.

Cleary (2): Sincere delight is auspicious. Regret vanishes.

Wu: There is joy with confidence. Auspicious. No regrets.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is due to the confidence he feels in his objective. Wilhelm/
Baynes: This consists in having faith in one's own will. Blofeld: This implies exerting
our will with complete confidence. Ritsema/Karcher: Trustworthy purpose indeed.
Cleary (2): Confidence in the aim. Wu: The confidence of his purpose.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Legge: The second line, by the rule of place, should be magnetic, but here is dynamic.
Without a proper correlate above, and contiguous to the magnetic third line, he might be
injuriously affected, and there would be cause for repentance. But the sincerity natural in
his central position counteracts all this.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is tempted by pleasures unbecoming to a superior man. But he clings to
duty and integrity.

Wing: By strengthening your integrity and principles, you will not be tempted by
distractions that are unworthy of your attention. In this way you will become free of regret
-- the regret that accompanies the waste of personal resources.

Editor: The Confucian commentary emphasizes calm self-confidence: one entertains no
doubts and indulges in no temptations to stray from the path, yet all the while remains
open and cheerful toward experience.

Man too, in his inner being, has a plane of contact with the divine self. And that's
why he can only find his own divine being within himself, never by directing his
attention towards the outside world.
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

A. Stay centered and keep the faith.

B. Trust your Self.

C. Have confidence in your intuition.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject bringing round herself whatever can
give pleasure. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Coming joyousness. Misfortune.

Blofeld: Coming joy -- misfortune! [The relation between the misfortune indicated by
this line and coming joy is not very clear. Interpreting it rather loosely, the passage can
be taken to mean that we shall suffer misfortune at a time when we are expecting
something which would afford us happiness; in other words, the expected joy may not
materialize.]

Liu: Coming joyousness. Misfortune. [Do not follow another blindly, or mistakes and
danger will result.]
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Ritsema/Karcher: Coming Opening, pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Coming usurpation; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Imported joy is not good.

Cleary (2): Coming for delight is inauspicious.

Wu: He comes to seek joy. Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The evil is shown by the inappropriateness of the line's place.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Its place is not the proper one. Blofeld: Misfortune is indicated by
the unsuitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed.
Cleary (2): Being out of place. Wu: His position is improper.

Legge: The K'ang-hsi editors say that the threatened evil to the subject of line three is due
to her excessive devotion to pleasure. She should be strong, but the desire for pleasure
leads her to the evil results described.

Anthony: Desire for things to be better, more relaxed or pleasurable, is the beginning of
self-pity, doubt and despair. Giving way to such feeling opens successively larger attacks
by these same feelings. Fear, restlessness, desire, pride, jealousy or anger are similar
strong elements which quickly take over and cause movement which is no longer self-
governed. Thus we lose our direction. If we look for any way to solve our problems other
than to follow our path modestly and “without purpose,” we are certain to be put through
distressing situations. For this reason, it is best not to dwell on how things “should be,” a
thought which springs from these strong elements.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Evil threatens the man because of his excessive devotion to idle pleasures.

Wing: Total abandonment to outside pleasures and diversions is only momentarily
fulfilling. These indulgences in idle distractions will surely bring misfortune. True
happiness will be found in the person full of his own nature.

Editor: Most commentaries mention self-indulgence or lack of control which allow
outside forces to enter and overwhelm one's will to serve the Work. I have found Anthony’s
insights, which bear little conformity with general interpretations of what constitutes
“joy,” to be particularly appropriate.

The Nefesh (animal soul) cannot see beyond its sensual or sensory range. While it
is true to say the arguments of the body are shrewd, they are never deeply
considered, as many a foolish moment of passion has shown in its result.
Z.B.S. Halevi -- A Kabbalistic Universe

58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

A. Your lack of control leaves you vulnerable to disintegrating influences.

B. Your outlook is simplistic and immature: You are self-indulgent.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject deliberating about what to seek his
pleasure in, and not at rest. He borders on what would be injurious but there will be cause
for joy.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace. After ridding himself of
mistakes a man has joy.

Blofeld: Calculating future joys, he is restless and suffers from various small ills, yet he is
happy.

Liu: Considering joyousness does not bring serenity. Once one corrects his conduct, one
has joyousness.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bargaining Opening, not-yet soothing. Chain-mail afflicting:
possessing rejoicing.

Shaughnessy: Patterned usurpation; not yet at peace; a transitional illness has
happiness.

Cleary (1): Joy after deliberation: If one is firm and wary without complacency, there will
be happiness.

Cleary (2): Deliberating about delight, one is uneasy. If one is firm and swift, there will
be happiness.

Wu: He is not at ease in pondering about joyousness, but he is glad to be able to
distinguish what is correct from what he despises.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The joy in connection with the subject of the fourth line is due to the
happiness which he will produce. Wilhelm/Baynes: The joy brings blessing. Blofeld:
There will be happiness in spite of this foolish anxiety because blessings [i.e., unexpected
or seemingly unmerited happiness] will be received. Ritsema/ Karcher: Possessing
reward indeed. Cleary (2): Celebration. Wu: There is something to celebrate.

Legge: The bordering on what is injurious has reference to the contiguity of line four to
the magnetic third line. That might have an injurious effect, but he reflects and deliberates
before he will yield to the seduction of pleasure, and there is cause for joy.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Anthony: In addition to the more literal meanings of this line, pleasure also means
departing from our limits to indulge our self-importance, power, correctness, wit,
intelligence, skill, sharpness or independence. Such luxuries of attitude are against our
inner nature and create self-conflict.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Indecision regarding the choice among pleasures temporarily robs the man of inner
peace. After due reflection, he attains joy by turning away from the lower pleasures and
seeking the higher ones.

Wing: You are suffering from indecision based upon a choice between inferior and
superior pleasures. If you recognize this and then choose the higher and more constructive
form of pleasure, you will find true happiness. Above all, make your decision soon.

Editor: Two kinds of "joy" are contrasted here: desire indulged vs. desire mastered, and
the line depicts ambivalence about which one you'll choose. If this is the only changing line,
the hexagram becomes number sixty -- Restrictive Regulations, with a corresponding
line that counsels the acceptance of limitation as productive of peace of mind and
contentment: "Shows its subject quietly and naturally attentive to all regulations. There
will be progress and success."

By reflecting upon the uselessness of aimlessly frittering away thy life, mayest
thou be incited to diligence in the treading of the Path.
W.Y. Evans-Wentz -- Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines

A. Rid yourself of ambivalence by accepting the limitations demanded by the Work:
"Yield not unto temptation."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject trusting in one who would injure him.
The situation is perilous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Sincerity toward disintegrating influences is dangerous.

Blofeld: Faith in what is disintegrating leads to trouble. [Presumably, we put our trust
in the continuance of something which, perhaps unknown to us, is already beginning to
crumble away.]

Liu: Confidence in what is decaying is dangerous. [If you get this line, you should expect
trouble caused by an unworthy person.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Conforming tending-towards stripping. Possessing adversity.
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

Shaughnessy: Sincerity in flaying; there is danger.

Cleary (1): There is danger in trusting plunderers.

Cleary (2): There is inspiration in sincerity toward the fallen.

Wu: He shows confidence in the one that may strip him: a sign of danger.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His place is that which is correct and appropriate. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The place is correct and appropriate. Blofeld: However, this line is suited to its
position (hence the trouble will hardly amount to much). Ritsema/Karcher: Situation
correcting appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): Being sincere toward the fallen, the position is
indeed appropriate. Wu: “He shows confidence in the one that may strip him,” because of
his position.

Legge: The danger to line five is from the magnetic line six above, in whom he is
represented as trusting. Possibly his own strength and sincerity of mind may be perverted
into instruments of evil; but possibly they may operate beneficially. The correctness of his
position seems to contradict his trusting of the line above, who can only injure him. On the
contrary, it should keep him from doing so. The commentators have seen this, and say that
the paragraph is intended by way of caution.

Anthony: This means we are sincere in listening to negative ideas, such as the temptation
to pursue self-advantage, or listening to doubt, impatience, fear, or pride, as in “having
rights.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man associates with destructive people and exposes himself to perils. There is
the possibility that his own strength and sincerity may be perverted into instruments of
evil.

Wing: You are contemplating a relationship with an inferior element. Such a commitment
is dangerous, for you will be drawn into peril. You must now be more selective in order to
protect yourself.

Editor: The message is unambiguous: A correct position is threatened by a negative
influence. Cleary’s Buddhist translation: “There is inspiration in sincerity toward the
fallen” is anomalous in my experience.

That happens when you get into a state in which you are not yourself, or into an
emotional upset where you lose control of yourself, but afterwards wake up
completely sober and look at the stupid things you did during your possessed
state and wonder what got into you: something got hold of you, you weren't
yourself, though while you were behaving like that you thought you were -- it was

58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

just as if an evil spirit or the devil had got into you. ... We would say, more
neutrally, an autonomous complex temporarily replaces the ego complex; it feels
like the ego at the time, but it isn't, for afterwards, when dissociated from it, one
cannot understand how one came to do or think such things.
M.L. Von Franz -- On Divination and Synchronicity

A. Overcome your fascination with forces that would spoil the Work.

B. You place your trust in illusions: "Stop indulging yourself."
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows the pleasure of its subject in leading and attracting
others.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Seductive joyousness.

Blofeld: Joy in the form of allurement. [This suggests the superficial joy offered by
attractions that would make no appeal to the Superior Man.]

Liu: Enticing joyousness.

Ritsema/Karcher: Protracting Opening.

Shaughnessy: Shadowy usurpation.

Cleary (1): Induced joy.

Cleary (2): Induced delight.

Wu: He attracts others to enjoy life.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her virtue is not yet brilliant. Wilhelm/Baynes: Line six is not
bright. Blofeld: This sort of joy is experienced by the unenlightened. Ritsema/
Karcher: Not-yet shining indeed. Cleary (2): Induced delight is not enlightened.
Wu: “He attracts others to enjoy life,” but his action is reproachable.

Legge: The symbolism of line six is akin to that of three. Line three attracts others around
herself for the sake of pleasure; the subject of this line leads them to follow herself in quest
of it. The action of the hexagram should culminate and end in line five, but the subject has
not yet understood the willpower by which the love of pleasure should be controlled.

Anthony: If we are irresolute, the pressures that vanity exerts in the form of self-pity,
impatience, restlessness or desire, may cause us to stray from our path. Such impulses, if
58 -- Joy (Self-indulgence) -- 58

not firmly resisted, will take over, at least temporarily. Of all evils, vanity is the most
seductive, therefore the most dangerous.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Vanity in his leadership causes the man to become dependent upon external
conditions and chances for satisfaction.

Wing: You are totally given over to external conditions. Your sense of well-being springs
not from within, but from what satisfaction you can find in the outside world. Because of
this you are subject to the mercy of chance and the fates of others.

Editor: Blofeld renders the line as: "Joy in the form of allurement.” Wilhelm uses the
concept of "seduction" to illustrate the idea, and Liu says: "enticement." Shaughnessy’s
“shadowy usurpation” suggests a kind of demonic possession, and sometimes this
interpretation feels more accurate than any of the others. It is instructive to note that
Wilhelm's commentary on this line states that the seduction refers to the situation
confronting the querent rather than the querent's attitude per se: "It rests with him
whether he will let himself be seduced." Intrapsychically, you are being self-indulgent
toward an inferior impulse or emotion.

For every one is in the joy of his heart when he is in his ruling love; and so, on the
other hand, he is in anguish of heart when he is withheld from it. This is the
common torment of hell, out of which innumerable others arise.
Swedenborg – Apocalypse Explained

A. You are being tempted by base desires or illusions.

B. Some sort of self-indulgence or “shadowy usurpation” is indicated.

59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59
HEXAGRAM NUMBER FIFTY-NINE –
EXPANSION (DISPERSION)

Other titles: Dispersion, Dissolution, Disintegration, Dispersal, Overcoming Dissension,
Scattering, Dispersing, Unintegrated, Reuniting, Evaporation, Reorganization, New Deal,
Re-Shuffle, Course Correction, Catharsis

Judgment

Legge: Expansion intimates that there will be progress and success. The king goes to
his ancestral temple. It will be advantageous to cross the great stream. It will be
advantageous to be firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Dispersion. Success. The king approaches his temple. It furthers
one to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Scattering -- success! The King has approached his temple. [An omen of
safety.] It is advantageous to cross the great river (or sea). [I.e., to go on a long journey.]
Persistence in a righteous course brings reward.

Liu: Dispersion. Success. The king approaches the temple. It is of benefit to cross the
great water. It benefits to continue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing, Growing. The king imagines possessing a temple.
Harvesting: wading the Great River. Harvesting Trial. [This hexagram describes your
situation in terms of confronting obstacles, illusions and misunderstandings. It
emphasizes that clearing away what is blocking the light is the adequate way to handle it.
To be in accord with the time, you are told to: disperse what obstructs awareness!]

Shaughnessy: Dispersal: Receipt; the king approaches into the temple; beneficial to
ford the great river; beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): In Dispersal there is development. The king comes to have a shrine. It is
beneficial to cross great rivers. It is beneficial to be correct.

Cleary (2): Dispersal is successful. The king goes to his ancestral temple. The benefit
crosses great rivers. It is beneficial if correct.

Wu: Dispersion indicates pervasiveness. The king does homage to his ancestral temple.
It will be advantageous to cross the big river, but only with perseverance.
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

The Image

Legge: The image of wind moving over water forms Expansion. The ancient kings, in
accordance with this, presented offerings to God and established the ancestral temple.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The wind drives over the water: the image of Dispersion. Thus the
kings of old sacrificed to the Lord and built temples.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing across the face of the waters. The kings
of old built temples in which to sacrifice to the Supreme Lord of Heaven. [A temple is a
place of safety from the ills of the world. The symbolism here is that the upper trigram
forms a temple in which people are safe from the pit (the lower trigram); its middle line
(five) signifies the King. The implication is that we should employ spiritual or moral
means to preserve ourselves from the danger threatened by the lower trigram.]

Liu: Wind blowing over water symbolizes Dispersion. The ancient kings offered
sacrifices to the Deity, then built temples.

Ritsema/Karcher: Wind moves above stream. Dispersing. The Earlier Kings used
presenting tending-towards the supreme to establish the temples.

Cleary (1): Wind blows above water, Unintegrated. Thus ancient kings honored god
and set up shrines.

Cleary (2): Wind travels over the water, dispersing. Ancient kings honored God and set
up shrines.

Wu: The wind moves above water; this is Dispersion. Thus, the ancient kings made
offerings to the Supreme Being and consecrated their ancestral temple.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The dynamic line is central in the lower trigram, and the magnetic
fourth line is correct in the upper trigram, uniting with the dynamic ruler above her. The
king's mind is without any deflection as he goes to his ancestral temple. He rides over
water in a vessel of wood, and will cross the great stream with success.

Legge: The hexagram of Expansion denotes a state of dissipation or dispersion. It
shows men's minds alienated from correctness and sure to go on to disorder. Here an
attempt is made to show how the situation should be remedied.

The lower trigram represents Water, and the upper, Wind. Wind moving over water
evaporates it, and suggests the idea of dispersion. Success is intimated because there are
dynamic lines occupying the central places in the trigrams. The king's piety moves the
spirits by its sincerity -- when the religious spirit rules men's minds, there will be no
alienation from what is right and good. Under such conditions even hazardous enterprises
may be undertaken.
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

The second sentence of the Confucian commentary literally begins: "The king is
indeed in the middle..." This means that his heart and mind are set on the central truth of
what is right and good. The ancestral temple signifies the recognition that sincere
religious practices counteracted the tendency to mutual alienation and selfishness among
men. The wooden vessel refers to one of the attributes of the upper trigram, which is
Wood. It suggests a boat riding on water (the lower trigram), hence: crossing the great
water.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Focus on the ideals of the Work and maintain your will. A major synthesis is
possible.

The Superior Man subdues his ego to attain his latent potential.

Because of the intimate relationship between this figure and hexagram number 45,
Contraction, I have chosen the title of Expansion to best emphasize their polarity.

The "ancient kings and sages" are more mythical than historical, so we can assume
that they symbolize archetypal forces ("gods") within the psyche -- of whom the ego is only
the current spacetime representative (i.e., servant- facilitator). The Self is the focal point,
the center of this multidimensional awareness complex.

In both timeless and spaceless experiences, the mundane world is virtually
excluded. Of course, the converse is true of the mundane state of daily routine, in
which the oceanic unity with the universe, in ecstasy and Samadhi, is virtually
absent. Thus, the mutual exclusiveness of the "normal" and the exalted states, both
ecstasy and Samadhi, allows us to postulate that man, the self- referential system,
exists on two levels: as "Self" in the mental dimension of exalted states; and as "I"
in the objective world, where he is able and willing to change the physical
dimension "out there.”
R. Fischer -- "A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States," Science:
174, 1971

The symbol of a temple, where one worships one's ancestors may be taken as the
perfect gestalt of the Work as it exists outside of spacetime, as well as the karmic
repository of all previous incarnations. It represents both the completed Work and the
Work in progress. That the family temple was regarded in China as symbolic of an ideal
standard of perfection such as this, is implied in the following passage:

Diplomatic negotiations were carried on in the ancestral temple, in the veritable
presence, it was believed, of the ancestors; diplomatic banquets were given there,
also. Even a proposal of marriage was received by the father of the prospective
bride in his ancestral temple, in the presence of the spirits ... (The world of
Confucius), we must remember, was one in which there was a nearly complete
breakdown of moral standards ... Only in the performance of religious

59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

ceremonies could there still be found, consistently, a type of conduct regulated by
a socially accepted norm of behavior, in which men's actions were motivated by a
pattern of cooperative action, rather than swayed by the greed and passions of
the moment.
H.G. Creel -- Confucius and the Chinese Way

Psychologically, Expansion depicts a state of inner pressure capable of fruitful
resolution if it can be properly guided. The king in the Image (in this case, the ego)
sacrifices for a high ideal: the good of the Work. Legge's commentary tells us that the
"second sentence of the Confucian commentary literally begins: `The king is indeed in the
middle...'" This suggests a combination of his second and third sentences into the
paraphrase: "The king steers a middle course when crossing the water to the ancestral
temple." This gives the image of a vessel and the proper way to guide it toward a
destination. Anyone who has ever steered a boat with a rudder knows that to over-correct
on either side is a mark of poor seamanship: the goal is to maintain a dynamic balance in
our guidance of the Work. Lines two and five represent proper course-correction because
they are both in the middle of their respective trigrams.

Expansion is the inverse of the following hexagram of Restrictive Regulations.
What is there confined and hoarded is here dispensed -- but this dispensation must
conform with the ultimate good of the Work. Not just any release of tension will do -- it
must recombine itself into a new and better organization, as imaged in the fourth line. If
this new order is a proper one, the released tension precipitates a catharsis, as imaged in
line five.

The form, then, in which our complexes confront us is the form in which the
fundamental materials of our human structure come into our here-and-now
existence. Like crystals they are always imperfect to some extent and often
unrecognizable or grossly disfigured in comparison with the “ideal” shape, the
shape that would represent the “pure” incorporation of the crystal scheme. But we
have to meet them in this more or less imperfect or distorted form and out of this
form we have to transform them into something that may be more akin to the
aboriginal “intent” inherent in their archetypal cores. This undertaking, this
process, is what Jung calls individuation.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDITATION

The Judgment of hexagram number forty-five, Contraction, also mentions the
king going to his ancestral temple. A close comparison of this figure with Expansion will
reveal much about the dynamics of the Work.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject engaged in rescuing from the impending
evil and having the assistance of a strong horse. There will be good fortune.
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

Wilhelm/Baynes: He brings help with the strength of a horse. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Helping others with the strength of a horse – good fortune!

Liu: To rescue one with a strong horse. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Availing-of a rescuing horse, invigorating significant.

Shaughnessy: Holding aloft a horse; auspicious; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): Act to save the horse. Vigor will have good results.

Cleary (2): For rescue, it is fortunate that the horse is strong.

Wu: To rescue with the aid of a strong horse is auspicious.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is due to the natural course pursued by its subject.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Is based on its devotion. Blofeld: Results from willing accord with
others. Ritsema/Karcher: Yielding indeed. Cleary (2): The fortune of the first yin is in
following. Wu: The auspiciousness comes from an amiable relationship.

Legge: Line one, at the commencement of the hexagram, tells us that the evil has not yet
made great progress, and that dealing with it will be easy. But the subject of the line is
magnetic in a dynamic place. She cannot cope with the evil herself. She must have help,
and she finds it in a strong horse, which is understood to symbolize the subject of the
dynamic second line. The "natural course” that line one pursues is that required by the
circumstances of the time.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man overcomes misunderstanding through a precise and energetic
response to the needs of the moment.

Wing: You can see the very beginning of discord. This is fortunate indeed, for it is far
easier to reunify and overcome separation when it first arises. Good fortune.

Editor: Both the Wilhelm and Legge commentaries tell us that line two is the horse
referred to here. It follows that if line two is the horse, then we can think of line one as its
"rider.” Horses symbolize raw energy, and suggest the instinctual-emotional components
of the psyche. The rider would be the ego who controls this energy. See the commentary
on line two for additional insights.

One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and
his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the

59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

prerogative of determining the goal and guiding the movements of his powerful
mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we
find a picture of the less than ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide
his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go.
Sigmund Freud

A. The situation demands all of your energy. Concentrate your forces and do your
utmost to guide the Work through difficulty.

B. Emotional energy serves the will.

C. Seek help.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject, amid the dispersion, hurrying to his
contrivance for security. All occasion for repentance will disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: At the dissolution he hurries to that which supports him. Remorse
disappears.

Blofeld: When disintegration is in process, hasten to the altar and regret will vanish.

Liu: At the dispersion he hastens to the opportunity. Remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing: fleeing one's bench. Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: Dispersal rushes its stairs; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): Running to support upon dispersal, regret vanishes.

Wu: At the time of Dispersion, he rushes to where the couch is. The regret will disappear.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He gets what he desires. Wilhelm/Baynes: And thus attains
what he wishes. Blofeld: We shall obtain what we desire. Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring
desire indeed. Cleary (2): Running to support on dispersal is attaining what is wished.
Cleary (2): Attaining what is wished. Wu: He gets what he wishes.

Legge: Line two is dynamic, but in a magnetic place, and although that place is central, it
is in the trigram of Peril. These conditions indicate evil, and action will be dangerous. But
line two looks to line one below him, and takes shelter in union with it. Line two desires
success in counteracting the prevailing tendency to disunion, and the Confucian
commentary suggests that he attains his desire.
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man finds himself alienated from others because of the prevailing ill humor and
misanthropy. However, he revises his judgment of humanity and takes shelter in his
strong position. His moderate and just view of mankind removes the causes for repentance
later.

Wing: Your problems originate from within. You must modify your attitudes and
overcome any feelings of alienation. If you can improve your opinions and feelings toward
your fellow man you will find peace of mind and avoid unnecessary suffering.

Editor: Legge renders the object of security here as a "contrivance.” Other translations of
this are: "Altar,” "Opportunity,” "Bench,” "Stairs” "Shelter,” “Couch,” and “That which
supports him.” Wilhelm and Blofeld say that this object is not line one, but line five.
Blofeld's commentary on the Image is appropriate to this second line as well: "The
symbolism here is that the upper trigram forms a temple in which people are safe from
the pit (the lower trigram); its middle line (five) signifies the king. The implication is
that we should employ spiritual or moral means to preserve ourselves from the danger
threatened by the lower trigram.” In other words: when confusion prevails rely on the
principles of the Work to guide your choices.

In the market place of every Chinese town there were a few I Ching priests who
would throw coins for you or take the yarrow stalks, and get answers to your
questions, but then it was forbidden. In 1960 Mao thought of slightly releasing
the rationalistic political pressures on the masses and found out that there were
two possibilities: either to give more rice, or to allow the use of the I Ching, and
all those whom he consulted told him that the people were more eager to use the I
Ching again than to get more food. Spiritual food, and the I Ching was their
spiritual food, was more important to them, so it was allowed for I think one or
two years and then he strangled it again.
M.L. Von Franz -- On Divination and Synchronicity

A. When things fall apart, maintain your center. (“The [Self] is indeed in the
middle...”)

B. Have faith in the principles of the Work.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject discarding any regard to her own
person. There will be no occasion for repentance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He dissolves his self. No remorse.

Blofeld: Self-centered thoughts are dispersed -- no regret!
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

Liu: He dissolves his egotism. No remorse. [A person should be wary of disaster: if it
occurs, he may not be able to escape its results.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing one's body. Without repenting.

Shaughnessy: Dispersing his torso; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Dispersing the self, there is no regret.

Wu: He distributes his personal belongings to others. There will be no regret.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She has no regard for her own person. Her aim is directed to what is
external to herself. Wilhelm/Baynes: His will is directed outward. Blofeld: The will is
fixed upon something external to our own well-being. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose
located outside indeed. Cleary (2): The aim is outside. Wu: His goal is to reach out.

Legge: Line three is magnetic in a dynamic place. Although we might fear an
excessive self-regard which would render her useless in the work of the hexagram,
she discards selfishness and will do nothing shameful. There is a change of style in
the Chinese text at this point. As Wang Sheng-tzu (Yuan dynasty) says -- "Here and
henceforth the scattering is of what should be scattered, that which should not be
scattered may be collected."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man disregards his own personal interests in order to work for the benefit of
others.

Wing: The proposed task is so great and difficult that you will need to put all personal
concerns aside. Working toward common goals will greatly benefit your inner strength;
there is no regret in such selflessness.

Editor: This line changes the hexagram to number fifty-seven, translated by Blofeld as
Willing Submission. The idea of selfless devotion to the Work is clearly implied. Liu's
version is the most concise, depicting "the sacrifice of egotism (in favor of the higher
possibilities within the situation)." Note that Wang Sheng-tzu’s commentary (see Legge
above) suggests the alchemical principle of solve et coagula – a profound concept from the
Perennial Philosophy.

The actual realization or living incarnation of the Self, however, requires the
presence of a disciplined ego to function as a responsible and conscious executor,
in the limited world of the here and now, of the Self's intentions and visions.
E.C. Whitmont -- Return of the Goddess

59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

A. Subdue your ego -- the Work takes precedence over your limited, divisive
fixations.

Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject scattering the different parties in the
state, which leads to great good fortune. From the dispersion she collects again good men
standing out, a crowd like a mound, which is what ordinary men would not have thought
of.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He dissolves his bond with his group. Supreme good fortune.
Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation. This is something that ordinary men do not
think of.

Blofeld: He disperses his group of companions [Namely a group of people who have
proved themselves inimical to the public good] -- sublime good fortune! Dispersion leads
to accumulation, but this is not something that ordinary people understand. [This is an
auspicious time to "cast our bread upon the waters." Acts of great generosity are now
essential to our success.]

Liu: He disperses his group. Great and fortune. (Sic.) He disperses his hills (property).
Ordinary people do not think of this.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing one's flock, Spring significant. Dispersing possessing the
hill-top. In-no-way hiding, a place to plunder.

Shaughnessy: Dispersing his flock; prime auspiciousness. Dispersal has a hillock; it is
not that about which the younger sister thinks.

Cleary (1): Dispersing the crowd is very auspicious. On dispersal there is gathering,
inconceivable to the ordinary.

Wu: He disbands cliques. Great fortune. A few mounds remain. This is not what ordinary
people can anticipate.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Brilliant and great are her virtue and service. Wilhelm/Baynes:
His light is great. Blofeld: In this context, sublime good fortune connotes glory.
Ritsema/Karcher: Shining great indeed. Cleary (2): The illumination is great. Wu:
What he does is right and brilliant.

Legge: Line four, though magnetic, is in its correct place, and adjoins the dynamic fifth-
line ruler. The subject of four therefore fitly represents the minister, whose task is to
assume a great part in remedying the evil of dispersion. She brings divisive partisanship to
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

an end, and re-assembles those who had been divided into a great body so that they stand
out conspicuously like a hill.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man brings dissent and partisanship to an end by his transcendent view of life's
interrelationships. He rises above personal friendships to assemble good men from near
and far.

Wing: Here you can bring dissent and discord to an end. The perspective that comes with
far-reaching ideals and concerns for the general welfare will allow you to transcend
partisan interests. In this way you will find extraordinary success.

Editor: Psychologically interpreted, "parties in the state" can symbolize obsolete
attitudes and limiting beliefs held by complexes within the psyche. The image suggests a
process of psychic re-organization. One is reminded of the alchemical aphorism: Solve et
coagula, et habebis magisterium. (“Separate and recombine, and you will have the
masterpiece.”) This refers to the differentiation of all the aspects of a situation for the
purpose of recombining them into a totally new entity.

Ultimately all conflicts of man are not only created by his, let us say, wrong
conscious attitude, but by the unconscious itself in order to reunite the opposites
on a higher level. Therefore this situation, where some religious doctrine or
teaching or tradition is poisonous and destructive to the physical instinctuality of
man, is not only to be viewed as a catastrophe or as a deviation from the original
pattern, but just as much a device of the unconscious psyche to bring forth higher
consciousness.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. Breaking up old patterns of perception makes room for new ideas.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject amidst the dispersion issuing his great
announcements as the perspiration flows from his body. He scatters abroad also the
accumulations in the royal granaries. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat. Dissolution! A king abides
without blame.

Blofeld: Scattering perspiration, he issues his royal command. The King disperses the
treasures in his palace among the people -- no blame. [One additional commentary
suggests that perspiration comes from illness and anxiety and that the meaning is: "The
King rids himself of cause for anxiety by ordering that his goods be dispersed among the
needy.” Again, large generosity is required for our success.]
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

Liu: Dispersion is like sweat pouring from the body, with loud cries. Separation from the
king's palace. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing sweat, one's great crying out. Dispersing. Kinghood
residing, without fault.

Shaughnessy: Dispersing his liver with a great cry. Dispersing the king's residence; there
is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Dispersing defilement, that is a great directive. The dispersing king remains
impeccable.

Cleary (2): Scattering sweat; the great call scatters. The king abides. There is no fault.

Wu: At the time of dispersion, he proclaims with loud voice until he perspires. He
distributes the contents in the royal residence. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The accumulations of the royal granaries are dispersed, and there is
no error -- this is due to the correctness of the position. Wilhelm/Baynes: He is in his
proper place. Blofeld: The correct position of this ruling line. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Correcting the situation indeed. Cleary (2): This is the right position. Wu: His position is
correct.

Legge: Line five shows us the proclamations and benevolent actions of the ruler himself.
Canon McClatchie gives an ingenious and original note upon the symbol of the
perspiration: “As sweat cures fevers, so do proclamations cure rebellions.”

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man announces a great policy during a period of disunity and deadlock which
serves as a rallying point for reforms. Misunderstanding is thereby dissipated by his
proclamation.

Wing: During times of discord and disunity a great proclamation or inspiring idea is
necessary to again reunify the situation. In this way, others put aside their factionalism
and work together once again.

Editor: Perspiration is a healing release of energy in response to somatic disequilibrium:
a catharsis. The definition of catharsis is: "Any purification or purgation that brings
about a spiritual renewal or a satisfying release of tension.” Wilhelm interprets this as an
idea or concept: “In times of general dispersion and separation, a great idea provides a
focal point for the organization of recovery.” Psychologically interpreted, "royal
granaries” (or "treasures”) are wellsprings of libido or Chi (Qi). The line thus suggests
psychic energy being redistributed as the result of the elimination of a previously blocked
condition. The keywords are redistribution/ reorganization -- showing how the forces
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

symbolized in this hexagram and Number 45, Contraction, comprise the expansion and
contraction phases of a larger evolutionary process. At its most neutral, the line can depict
any sudden release of energy, such as conversational enthusiasm.

Shaughnessy’s rendering: “Dispersing his liver with a great cry...” suggests a
connection with Chinese medicine which may be useful in interpreting the symbolism of
this line:

“Traditional Chinese physiology tells us that the healthy liver establishes a smooth
and soothing flow of energy through the whole person, in both body and mind ...
When obstructed, stagnant, or overheated, the energy flow in the liver and
throughout the body is hampered, resulting in myriad physical and emotional
problems ... Mood swings as well as emotional excesses in general are liver-
related ... From the Five Element perspective, an excessive and “greedy” liver not
only steals from its mother, the kidneys, but...also refuses to give sufficient energy
to its own son, the heart. One of the most efficient ways of improving the condition
of the liver is to give its excess a place to go, and the obvious place is where it
naturally flows – to its son, the heart. By strengthening the heart and
encouraging it to receive energy, the liver is encouraged to release its excess.”
P. Pitchford – Healing with Whole foods

A. Release of tension ("letting-go") creates a nourishing catharsis.

B. Image of a beneficial reorganization of some kind: perhaps of ideas or beliefs.

C. "You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs."
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject disposing of what may be called
his bloody wounds, and going to separate himself from his anxious fears. There will be no
error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He dissolves his blood. Departing, keeping at a distance, going out, is
without blame.

Blofeld: Dispersing blood (i.e. fending off injury or violence), he keeps it at a distance --
no blame! [The text of the original is so unclear that the additional commentaries all
disagree as to the meaning of dispersing blood, but the general idea is perfectly clear
from the commentary on the line.]

Liu: Dissolving his (coagulated) blood. Departing to a remote place. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Dispersing one's blood. Departing far-away, issuing-forth. Without
fault.
59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

Shaughnessy: Dispersing his blood, he departs, warily exiting.

Cleary (1): Dispersing the blood, going far away, there is no fault.

Wu: At the time of dispersion, he disperses what hurts him and alleviates what worries
him. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: His bloody wounds are gone. He is far removed from the danger of
injury. Wilhelm/Baynes: He keeps at a distance from injury. Blofeld: This means
keeping evil at a distance. Ritsema/Karcher: Distancing harm indeed. Cleary (2):
Scattering the blood means avoiding harm. Wu: “He disperses what hurts him,” because
he is able to distance it.

Legge: Line six is dynamic, with a magnetic third line correlate. However, because three
is at the top of the trigram of Peril, six avoids her company. He does this in the spirit of
dispersion, and therefore incurs no blame.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man removes the sources of danger and bloodshed.

Wing: Avoidance of danger is necessary at this time, both for yourself and especially for
those of your concern. This should be accomplished in whatever way possible. Depart the
situation if necessary. You will not be blamed for such action.

Editor: Wilhelm emphasizes in his commentary the idea of one who helps his kin avoid
danger. Psychologically, this means to keep your "inner family” from harm. If this is the
only changing line, the hexagram becomes number twenty-nine, Danger, suggesting a
serious situation demanding a careful choice of options. Wu’s translation seems to convey
the idea most succinctly.

ONE STEP BACKWARD TAKEN
Not only sands and gravels
Were once more on their travels,
But gulping muddy gallons
Great boulders off their balance
Bumped heads together dully
And started down the gully.
Whole capes caked off in slices.
I felt my standpoint shaken
In the universal crisis.
But with one step backward taken
I saved myself from going.
A world torn loose went by me.
Then the rain stopped and the blowing

59 - Expansion (Dispersion) - 59

And the sun came out to dry me.
Robert Frost

A. For the good of the Work avoid any confrontation with disruptive elements.

B. Protect the psyche from harm. Avoid danger.

C. Disperse your anger, righteous indignation, etc.

60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60
HEXAGRAM NUMBER SIXTY --
RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS

Other titles: Limitation, Restraint, Regulations, Articulating, Receipt, Restraining,
Containment

Judgment

Legge: Restrictive Regulations bring progress and success, but if they are severe and
difficult they cannot be permanent.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Limitation. Success. Galling limitation must not be persevered in.

Blofeld: Restraint -- success! It is wrong to persist in harsh restraint.

Liu: Limitation. Success. Bitter limitation should not be continued.

Ritsema/Karcher: Articulating, Growing. Bitter Articulating not permitting Trial.
[This hexagram describes your situation in terms of confused relations. It emphasizes
that making limits and connections clear, particularly through speech, is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Receipt. Withered moderation; one may not determine.

Cleary (1): Discipline is developmental, but painful discipline is not to be held to.
[Discipline means having limits that are not to be exceeded. This hexagram represents
practicing obedience in unfavorable circumstances, adaptably keeping to the Tao. The
situation may be up to others, but creation of destiny is up to oneself. When discipline
gets to the point of inflicting suffering, it brings on danger itself even where there was no
danger; you will only suffer toil and servility which is harmful and has no benefit.]

Cleary (2): Regulation is successful, but painful regulation is not to be held to.

Wu: Regulation indicates pervasiveness. Excessive regulation should not be obstinately
pursued. [Sometimes the meaning of conservation or moderation is implied. Although the
idea of regulation is convincing, it should not be applied blindly without regard to
conditions.]
The Image

Legge: Water over a lake -- the image of Restrictive Regulations. The superior man
constructs methods of numbering and measurement, and examines the nature of virtuous
conduct.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Wilhelm/Baynes: Water over lake: the image of Limitation. Thus the superior man
creates number and measure, and examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes water held in a dyke above a marshy lake. The
Superior Man employs a system of regulations in his plans for the widespread practice of
virtue.

Liu: Water above the lake symbolizes Limitation. The superior man devises number
and measure, and measures conduct and virtue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh possessing stream. Articulating. A chun tzu uses
paring to reckon the measures. A chun tzu uses deliberating actualizing-tao to move.
[Actualize-tao: ...ability to follow the course traced by the ongoing process of the
cosmos... Linked with acquire, TE: acquiring that which makes a being become what it is
meant to be.]

Cleary (1): There is water over a lake, regulated. Thus superior people determine
measures and discuss various actions.

Cleary (2): ... Leaders establish numbers and measures, and consider virtuous conduct.

Wu: There is water above the marsh; this is Regulation. Thus, the jun zi enacts statutes
and deliberates virtues. [A study of the limits and merits will avert difficulties.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Progress and attainment are seen in the equally divided dynamic and
magnetic lines, with the dynamic lines in the central places. If the regulations are severe
and difficult, the course of action will come to an end. We see a cheerful attitude directing
the course amidst peril. The rules are correctly initiated by the ruler in the fifth place.
Heaven and earth observe their regular cycles and complete the four seasons. When rulers
frame their laws according to just limitations, the resources of the state suffer no injury,
and the people receive no hurt.

Legge: The written Chinese character which denotes Restrictive Regulations means
the regular division of a whole, such as the division of the seasons of the year into ninety-
day periods clearly marked by the solstices and equinoxes. Whatever makes regular
division may be denominated by a "restrictive regulation," and there enter into it the ideas
of ordering and restraining. The hexagram deals with the regulations of government
enacted for the guidance and control of the people. An important point is made that these
regulations must be adapted to the circumstances and not made too strict and severe.

Ch'eng-tzu says on the Image: "The water which a lake or marsh will contain is
limited to a certain quantity. If the water flowing in exceeds that amount, it overflows.
This gives us the idea of Restrictive Regulations."
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Restrictive Regulations are necessary for growth, but severe restriction
must itself be limited.

The Superior Man differentiates his options in relation to the goals of the Work.

The Work itself is nothing if not a rigid structure imposed upon one's life -- a
"restrictive regulation" of the ego's illusion of freedom of choice. Ordinary people insist
that their lives are ordered by the intelligent exercise of free will, but this "freedom" is
more commonly just a rationalization for the activity of autonomous complexes. No one
can look objectively at the current state of the world and seriously claim that it reflects
either rational order or balanced perception. Collective human experience on this planet
is determined by the whims of archetypal forces expressing themselves through the
unconscious psyches of six-billion people.

The Work then, is a restrictive regulation of these autonomous forces -- it is a
limitation, a containment of the expression of instinct and desire. We are reminded of the
alchemical vessel which is hermetically sealed to prevent its contents from escaping before
they have been transmuted into gold. If the alchemist miscalculates his "methods of
numbering and measurement" the vessel becomes a kind of bomb: the seal breaks, the
contents explode, and the Work is ruined. This is what is meant by "if the regulations are
severe and difficult, the course of action will come to an end." If we restrict the contents
of the vessel beyond their capacity for confinement the psyche boils over in some degree of
rebellion. This is no minor thing -- depending on the circumstances, severe psychotic
reactions can be created in this manner.

On the other hand, the ego thinks that all but the most minor restrictions are severe
and difficult, and it is constantly on the verge of rebellion. As always, it is the Self which
must determine how far the restrictive regulations can be taken. From its perspective
outside of spacetime it is best able to determine how much pressure the psyche can take --
frequently it is far more (or sometimes far less) than the ego thinks possible.

The Confucian commentary observes: "We see a cheerful attitude directing the
course amidst peril." This refers to the lower trigram of Cheerfulness encountering the
upper trigram of Peril or Danger. The restrictions of the Work are more often than not
unpleasant and risky, constantly verging on some kind of an explosion. An attitude of
cheerful acceptance enables one to survive these difficult trials. This is an extremely
important concept, because without it one can all too easily fall into a suicidal despair.
The Work can become an impossible burden unless one learns how to approach stress and
hardship with an almost irreverent sense of humor. (This in itself is an essential lesson
about how to purge the ego of its myopic notions of what it will and will not "accept" in
life.)

There is an old Zen proverb that says: "Hell, also, is a place to live in." The message
is clear: be of good cheer, because without it you are sure to fail.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

The seeming inevitability of conflict among the archetypal "powers" can cause us
to experience life as a hopeless, senseless impasse. But the conflict can also be
discovered to be the expression of a symbolic pattern still to be intuited. It can be
lived as if it were a drama, the play of life or of the gods, for the purpose of
experiencing an ultimate meaning ... When one can feel with Goethe that
"everything transient is but a symbol," then meaning can be found not only in
creativity, joy and love but also in impasse, suffering and conflict. Then life can be
lived as a work of art.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject not quitting the courtyard outside his
door. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Not going out of the door and the courtyard is without blame.

Blofeld: He goes not go forth from the outer gates and courtyards of his home -- no
error!

Liu: One does not go out of the door and courtyard. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not issuing-forth-from the door chambers. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Not going out of the door or window; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Not leaving home, there is no blame.

Wu: He does not go beyond the entrance hall of his house. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He knows when he has free course and when he is obstructed.
Wilhelm/Baynes: One knows what is open and what is closed. Blofeld: He acts thus
from his knowledge of when things can be carried through to their end and when they will
be blocked. [The implication is that we should now hold back.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Knowing interpenetrating clogging indeed. Cleary (2): Not leaving home is knowing
passage and obstruction. Wu: He knows what can be done and what cannot be.

The Master said: "When disorder arises, it will be found that ill-advised speech
was the stepping stone to it. If a ruler does not keep secret his deliberations with his
minister, he will lose that minister. If a minister does not keep secret his deliberations
with his ruler, he will lose his life. If important matters in the germ are not kept secret,
that will be injurious to their accomplishment. Therefore the superior man is careful to
maintain secrecy, and does not allow himself to speak."
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Legge: Line one is dynamic in a dynamic place, and therefore has the power to move. But
he is kept in check by the dynamic second line, and his fourth line correlate occupies the
first position in the trigram of Peril. He therefore knows when he has free course and
when he is obstructed, and in this case the course of wisdom is to keep still. He regulates
himself by a consideration of the times. The Daily Lecture says that the line tells an officer
not to take office rashly, but to exercise a cautious judgment in his measures.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Wilhelm/Baynes: Often a man who would like to undertake something finds himself
confronted by insurmountable limitations. Then he must know where to stop. If he rightly
understands this and does not go beyond the limits set for him, he accumulates an energy
that enables him, when the proper time comes, to act with great force. Discretion is of
prime importance in preparing the way for momentous things. ...We see locked doors
ahead and therefore hold back.

Siu: At the outset, the man appreciates his own limitations and exercises judicious
discretion in not pressing beyond them. He does not exert his authority rashly.

Wing: Although you would like to take certain measures in the current pursuit of your
aims, when you see obstacles ahead you must stop. Such Limitations should be
recognized and accepted. Stay within the limits and collect your strength quietly.

Editor: If this is the only changing line, the hexagram becomes number twenty-nine,
Danger. Obviously, "discretion is the better part of valor" -- one should stay put and not
act.

Never set your foot on the path of the wicked, do not walk the way that the evil go.
Avoid it, do not take it, turn your back on it, pass it by.
Proverbs 4: 14

A. Sit tight and accept the limitations of the situation.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject not quitting the courtyard inside his
gate. There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Not going out of the door and courtyard brings misfortune.

Blofeld: He goes not forth from the inner gates and courtyards of his home --
misfortune!

Liu: One does not go out the gate and courtyard. Misfortune. [Generally, this line bodes
good fortune for action and misfortune for inaction.]
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Ritsema/Karcher: Not issuing-forth-from the gate chambers. Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Not going out of gate or courtyard; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): Not going outside bodes ill. [Holding fast to petty regulations is a great loss.]

Wu: He does not go beyond his courtyard. Foreboding.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He loses the time for action to an extreme degree. Wilhelm/
Baynes: One misses the crucial moment. Blofeld: Misfortune because he neglects to take
advantage of an opportunity now presenting itself. [The implication is that it would be
wrong to hold back now.] Ritsema/Karcher: Letting-go the season end indeed. Cleary
(2): One misses the timing in the extreme. Wu: He misses an opportunity.

Legge: Line two is dynamic in a magnetic place and without the help of a proper correlate.
He keeps still when he ought to be up and doing. There will be evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The time for immediate action has come. The opportunity should be seized quickly
and energetically. The man does not act, and bad luck ensues.

Wing: Opportunity and potential are on their way. If you hesitate when the time is right,
you will miss your chance entirely. Such bad timing is a result of excessive limitation.

Editor: Line one depicts one restricting himself when it is proper to do so -- line two
symbolizes the opposite case: He restricts himself when the times call for action. A fearful,
over-cautious or perhaps merely ignorant attitude prevents him from taking the necessary
initiative. Sometimes one receives both lines: a seeming contradiction, unless seen as a
subtle differentiation of choice. I.e., The first line negates the immediate question, but the
second warns us that action of a different character is necessary.

There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to
fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
Shakespeare -- Julius Caesar

A. You inhibit yourself unnecessarily -- take advantage of your opportunities. The
time calls for action, but you aren't acting.

B. Seek wider horizons.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject with no appearance of observing the
proper regulations, in which case we shall see her lamenting. But there will be no one to
blame but herself.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He who knows no limitation will have cause to lament. No blame.

Blofeld: Sighing over an apparent lack of restraint -- no error!

Liu: One does not limit oneself and has cause for lamenting. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not the Articulating like, by-consequence the lamenting like.
Without fault.

Shaughnessy: If one is not moderate-like, then one will be sighing-like; there is no
trouble.

Cleary (1): If one is not disciplined, one will lament. It is no fault of others.

Cleary (2): Without regulation there will be lament, but you cannot blame anyone.

Wu: If he does not achieve any regulation, he will lament later. No one is to blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Who should there be to blame? Wilhelm/Baynes: Lament over
neglect of limitation -- who is to blame for this? Blofeld: Who would find fault with that?
[It is salutary to regret lack of restraint in ourselves or others.] Ritsema/Karcher:
Furthermore whose fault indeed? Cleary (2): Whose fault is the lament that comes from
lack of regulation? Wu: He laments for being not able to conserve. Who else is to blame?

Legge: Line three should be dynamic, but is magnetic, and neither central nor correct.
She has no proper correlate, and is the topmost line in the trigram of Complacent
Satisfaction. She refuses the restrictive regulations and will discover her mistake after it is
too late. She knows by her lamentations that she only has herself to blame.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not follow promulgated laws in his own activities. His actions lead to
regret.

Wing: Your extravagant behavior and lack of restraint have led you into a state of
difficulty. If you are now feeling regret over this and not busy placing the blame elsewhere,
you will avoid further mistakes.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Editor: Wilhelm says: "No blame," and Blofeld says: "No error." These renderings seem
misleading, since Legge's admonition: "But there will be no one to blame but herself" is
more in harmony with the line's meaning. Wilhelm's commentary paradoxically
acknowledges this: "But one has oneself to blame for this result." The line is often given in
the conditional sense: "If you don't observe the proper regulations, you'll be sorry."

A healthy mind is a castle that cannot be invaded without the will of its master;
but if [evil spirits] are allowed to enter, they excite the passions of men and
women, they create cravings in them, they produce bad thoughts which act
injuriously upon the brain; they sharpen the animal intellect and suffocate the
moral sense. Evil spirits obsess only those human beings in whom the animal
nature is preponderating. Minds that are illuminated by the spirit of truth cannot
be possessed; only those who are habitually guided by their own lower impulses
may become subjected to their influence.
Paracelsus -- De Ente Spirituali

A. An image of self-caused misfortune.

B. You'll regret it if you exceed the mean.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject quietly and naturally attentive to all
regulations. There will be progress and success.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Contented limitation. Success.

Blofeld: Peaceful restraint -- success!

Liu: Peaceful limitation. Success.

Ritsema/Karcher: Quiet Articulating Growing.

Shaughnessy: Placid moderation; receipt.

Cleary (1): Peaceful discipline is developmental.

Cleary (2): Peaceful regulation is successful.

Wu: He achieves regulation with ease. Pervasive.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Progress and success is due to the difference which accepts the ways
of the ruler above. Wilhelm/Baynes: Accepting the way of the one above. Blofeld:
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Success is indicated by the firm line immediately above this one. Ritsema/ Karcher:
Receiving tao above indeed. Cleary (2): Taking up the higher path. Wu: He supports his
superior.

Legge: Line four is magnetic, as it ought to be, and she has respect for the authority of the
dynamic ruler in line five above her -- hence the good symbolism and auspice.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man understands the nature of regulations and accommodates accordingly. He
does not waste energy in useless struggles, but directs it effectively to solving the problem
at hand.

Wing: Allow your Limitations to become natural extensions of your behavior.
Accommodate and adapt yourself to the fixed conditions in the situation. Don't carry on
battles over "the principle of the thing." Deal with the matter at hand and you
will meet with success.

Editor: The idea here is to work within the limitations of the situation at hand. By doing
this, one acts according to the will of the Self: ("...accepts the ways of the ruler above").

When nothing is possible without His will, then what is the use of planning? Is it
not better to depend on Him and do as He wills? ... When his will bids
circumstances and environment change, then accept the change, not before.
Swami Saradananda

A. Accept the restrictions of the Work.
Line-5

Legge: Line five, dynamic, shows its subject sweetly and acceptably enacting his
regulations. There will be good fortune. The onward progress with them will afford
ground for admiration.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Sweet limitation brings good fortune. Going brings esteem.

Blofeld: Voluntary restraint -- good fortune! Advancing now wins praise. [Presumably
this means that we have rightly exercised restraint and that the time has now come for
us to continue our advance.]

Liu: Sweet limitation. Good fortune. Undertakings bring honor.

Ritsema/Karcher: Sweet Articulating significant. Going possesses honor.

Shaughnessy: Sweet moderation; auspicious; in going there will be elevation.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

Cleary (1): Contented discipline is good: If you go on, there will be exaltation.

Cleary (2): Contented regulation is auspicious. To go on will result in exaltation.

Wu: There is optimal regulation. Auspicious. Wherever he goes, he will succeed.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The good fortune is due to the line occupying the place of authority
and being in the center. Wilhelm/Baynes: The good fortune comes from remaining
central in one's own place. Blofeld: This is indicated by the central position of this ruling
line. Ritsema/Karcher: Residing-in the situation: centering indeed. Cleary (2): The
position one is in is balanced. Wu: His central position.

Legge: Line five is dynamic and in his correct place. He has no proper correlate, and so
regulates himself. But he is the lord of the hexagram, and his influence is everywhere
beneficially felt.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Before exacting obedience from others, the man in a high position first applies the
restrictions to himself. His beneficial influence is widely felt.

Wing: In influencing others you must become an example. When Limitations and
restrictions are necessary, take them upon yourself first. In this way you are certain that
they are acceptable while you win the praise and emulation of others. Good fortune.

Editor: If we don't impose restrictions on ourselves, we are not likely to influence others
to do so: "Handsome is as handsome does." In many contexts, the line can suggest a
situation in which one may advance only by clearly differentiating its inherent limitations.

But animals which live in pure nature never overdo anything, neither sex nor food
nor anything else, because their patterns of behavior always impose the right
measure and the moment to stop. The moment to start and the moment to stop is
all built into their behavioral system, which is why Jung always said that
animals were much more pious and religious than man because they really obey
their inner order and really follow the meaning of what they are meant to be,
never going beyond that.
M.L. Von Franz -- Alchemical Active Imagination

A. Equitable discipline advances the Work.

B. By recognizing innate difficulties within the situation one is enabled to proceed
pragmatically.

C. Maintain realistic expectations in the matter at hand.
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject enacting regulations severe and difficult.
Even with firmness and correctness there will be evil. But though there will be cause for
repentance, it will by and by disappear.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Galling limitation. Perseverance brings misfortune. Remorse
disappears.

Blofeld: Painful restraint -- persistence brings misfortune! However, regret will cease
later.

Liu: Bitter limitation. Continuing brings misfortune. Remorse vanishes.

Ritsema/Karcher: Bitter articulating, Trial: pitfall. Repenting extinguished.

Shaughnessy: Withered moderation; determination is inauspicious; regret is gone.

Cleary (1): Painful discipline bodes ill if persisted in, but regret vanishes.

Cleary (2): Painful regulation bodes ill if persisted in. By repenting, it is eliminated.

Wu: There is excessive regulation. It will be foreboding to pursue it obstinately. Regret
will disappear. [In this extreme position, he has no business to do stringent regulation.
Whatever he does will be excessive and therefore foreboding. The fact that he remembers
the virtue of regulation will mitigate his regret for overdoing it.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The course indicated by the hexagram has come to an end.
Wilhelm/Baynes: Its way comes to an end. Blofeld: Misfortune in the sense that the
road we are following peters out. [This implies that we should stop following our present
course and that, by doing so, we shall eliminate the cause of our present worry or
regret.] Ritsema/Karcher: One's tao exhausted indeed. Cleary (2): That path comes
to an impasse. Wu: Excessive regulation is foreboding, because it goes nowhere.

Legge: Line six is magnetic, in its proper place. She must be supposed to possess an
exaggerated desire for enacting regulations. They will be too severe, and the effect will be
evil. But as Confucius says in the Analects 3:3, it is not so great a fault as to be easy and
remiss. It may be remedied, and cause for repentance will disappear.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man exhibits an exaggerated desire for restrictive regulations. This will not be
endured for long by the people. However, ruthless severity may, at times, be the only
60 -- Restrictive Regulations -- 60

protection against temptation and irresolution and may eliminate later cause for
repentance.

Wing: Excessive restrictions demanded of others will eventually meet with resentment.
Nothing worthwhile can be accomplished in this way. However, for your own benefit, you
may require severe restraints for a time to aid in your self-development and to help you
avoid regretful mistakes.

Editor: In terms of the Work, this is an extremely tricky line demanding subtle
interpretation. The first two sentences are a rephrasing of the Judgment; the last sentence
is a disclaimer telling us that excessive regulations are acceptable after all. This
juxtaposition of contradictory ideas suggests a test situation: it is left entirely up to the
querent where to draw the line. In the absence of contrary data it is usually safe to side
with Confucius as described in Legge's commentary. On the other hand, it must also be
recognized that extreme restriction is not the middle way, hence can only be useful as a
strategic temporary measure, not as a way of life.

Sacrifice is necessary. If nothing is sacrificed nothing is obtained. And it is
necessary to sacrifice something precious at the moment, to sacrifice for a long
time and to sacrifice a great deal. But still, not forever. This must be understood
because often it is not understood. Sacrifice is necessary only while the process of
crystallization is going on. When crystallization is achieved, renunciations,
privations, and sacrifices are no longer necessary.
Gurdjieff

A. You are limiting yourself, but it is OK.

B. Too much structure inhibits growth.

C. When discipline becomes oppression, the Work suffers.

Judgment

Legge: Inner Truth moves even pigs and fish, and leads to good fortune. There will be
advantage in crossing the great stream. There will be advantage in being firm and correct.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Inner Truth. Pigs and fishes. Good fortune. It furthers one to cross
the great water. Perseverance furthers.

Blofeld: Inward Confidence and Sincerity. Dolphins -- good fortune! It is
advantageous to cross the great river (or sea). Persistence in a right course brings reward.

Liu: Inner Truthfulness. Sea Lions -- good fortune. It is of benefit to cross the great
water.

Ritsema/Karcher: Centering Conforming, hog fish significant. Harvesting: wading
the Great River. Harvesting trial. (Hog fish, T’UN YU: aquatic mammals; porpoise,
dolphin; intelligent aquatic animals whose development parallels the human; sign of
abundance and good luck.) [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of the
relation between your inner core and the circumstances of your life. It emphasizes that
bringing your central concerns and your life situation into a sincere and reliable accord
is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Central Return: the piglet and fish are auspicious; harmonious:
beneficial to ford the great river; beneficial to determine.

Cleary (1): Faithfulness in the center is auspicious when it reaches even pigs and
fish. It is beneficial to cross great rivers. It is beneficial to be correct.

Cleary (2): Sincerity in the center is auspicious when simple-minded ... etc.

Wu: Sincerity moves piglets and fishes. Auspicious. It will be advantageous to cross the
big river with perseverance.

The Image

Legge: Wood on a Marsh -- the image of Inner Truth. The superior man deliberates
about cases of litigation and delays the infliction of death.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Wind over lake: the image of Inner Truth. Thus the superior man
discusses criminal cases in order to delay executions.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes wind blowing over a marshy lake. The Superior Man
devotes careful thought to his judgments and is tardy in sentencing people to death.

Liu: The wind over the lake symbolizes Inner Truthfulness. The superior man judges
criminals and postpones capital punishment.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above marsh possessing wind. Centering Conforming. A chun
tzu uses deliberating litigating to delay dying.

Cleary (1): There is wind above a lake, with truthfulness between them. Thus superior
people consider judgments and postpone execution.

Cleary (2): There is wind over a lake, with sincerity in the center. True leaders
consider judgments and postpone execution.

Wu: There is wind above the marsh: this is Sincerity. Thus, the jun zi deliberates the
verdicts and enjoins the death sentence.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Inner Truth shows two magnetic lines occupying the innermost
part of the hexagram, with dynamic lines in the centers of the trigrams. We see the
attributes of Cheerfulness and Flexible Penetration -- sincerity thus symbolized reaches
even to pigs and fishes and will transform the country. We see one riding on the symbol of
Wood, which forms an empty boat -- hence it is advantageous to cross the great stream.
The virtue of Inner Truth requires firm correctness and shows the proper response of
man to heaven.

Legge: Inner Truth denotes the highest quality of man, giving its possessor the power
to prevail with spiritual beings, with other men and with lower creatures. There are two
magnetic lines in the center and two dynamic lines above and below them. The magnetic
lines represent the heart and mind free from all preoccupation, without any consciousness
of self. The two dynamic lines immediately above and below them are each in the center of
their respective trigram, and denote the solid virtue of one so free from selfishness.

The trigram of Wood above the trigram for a Lake or Marsh suggests a boat
crossing the great stream. The pigs and fishes symbolize the rudest and most obstinate of
men. Ch'eng-tzu observes: "We have in the sincerity shown in the upper trigram
superiors condescending to those below them in accordance with their peculiarities, and
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

we have in that of the lower those below delighted to follow their superiors. The
combination of these two things leads to the transformation of the country and state."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: It is a great accomplishment when Inner Truth alters archetypal forces
within the psyche. The ego’s devotion to the Work is the means to this end.

The Superior Man carefully differentiates his options and avoids drastic measures.
(Can sometimes mean: "Don't act until you are sure of all the facts.")

Anyone who monitors his dreams and other images knows that the unconscious is a
continuous wellspring of psychic energy. Jung has observed that we are probably
dreaming all of the time -- the only reason we don't usually notice this is because the
conscious mind is so powerful that the more subtle manifestations of the psyche are
eclipsed. Since consciousness consists of only the upper layers of a deep continuum of
awareness it is obvious that we are being continuously "created from within." The
ultimate source of our being is not easily accessible, but all of the empirical evidence
points to a "Self" which transcends the space-time continuum -- i.e., lives in another
"dimension."

The capacity to nullify space and time must somehow inhere in the psyche, or, to
put it another way, the psyche does not exist wholly in time and space. It is very
probable that only what we call consciousness is contained in space and time, and
that the rest of the psyche, the unconscious, exists in a state of relative
spacelessness and timelessness.
Jung -- Letters

This seemingly exotic concept was written by Jung in 1939, yet today the theories of
the quantum physicists are approaching the point where awareness itself will be
recognized as space-time transcendent.

In the modern Kaluza-Klein theory all the forces of nature, not merely gravity, are
treated as manifestations of spacetime structure. What we normally call gravity
is a warp in the four spacetime dimensions of our perceptions, while the other
forces are reduced to higher-dimensional spacewarps. All the forces of nature are
revealed as nothing more than hidden geometry at work ... There is a deep
compulsion to believe in the idea that the entire universe, including all the
apparently concrete matter that assails our senses, is in reality only a frolic of
convoluted nothingness, that in the end the world will turn out to be a sculpture of
pure emptiness, a self-organized void.
Paul Davies -- Superforce

The physicists now hypothesize an eleven-dimensional universe, and state that the
seven "extra" dimensions are somehow "rolled up to a very small size" so that they are not
apparent to our senses. If we are going to hypothesize such fantastic realms it is more
elegant to hypothesize consciousness itself as emanating from an extra-dimensional
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

source. This is the Pleroma of the Gnostics and Alchemists, the upper and lower worlds of
shamanism, or in Jungian parlance: the Objective Psyche or Collective Unconscious.

The familiar spacetime of our conscious experience consists of three linear
dimensions, plus time. Time is considered a dimension, but not like the other three -- one
can go up, down, forward and backward, to the left or right at will, but one cannot go back
to this morning or forward to next Thursday afternoon. The time dimension is a
continuous "now" and we experience it and the other three dimensions from the reference
point of consciousness -- we are the center from which all dimensions radiate.
Consciousness is like time in that it is always "now," and since consciousness emerges
from within in a continuous and autonomous flow, we can legitimately hypothesize that
we emanate from a power source in another dimension. We are a kind of continuous
explosion from within -- a microcosmic version of the "Big Bang" which originated the
universe, and which, incidentally, is still exploding-expanding outward into space.

If everything that is recognizable is so only because it has separated itself from the
"all and nothingness," leaving its complementary half behind in the unmanifested
state, then the earth too must have its complementary half in the unmanifested
state, and the force of gravitation it exerts on all the creatures and objects living
on it is the striving for reunification between the earth and its unmanifested
complementary half which has been left behind in the void as its negative
reflection. The earth's gravitational pull thus draws all the earth towards the void
which stands beyond time and space, in order to bring about this reunion. If the
earth were to yield, all the earth and everything on it would disappear into the
center, into the void. But that would be a return to the paradisiacal unity -- to
God -- to bliss!
Elisabeth Haich -- Initiation

The image of the hexagram Inner Truth gives us the idea of an "empty" center --
as good an image as could be devised from the structural components of the trigrams to
show the inner source of human consciousness. The pigs and fishes of the Judgment are
the archetypal complexes which must be tamed through the process of the Work, and to
"cross the great stream" with firm correctness is to accomplish this holy task.

Through all ages men have sought, and some have found; there is a door through
which we can pass out on to the higher planes, but that door is within the soul, it is
an enlargement of consciousness whereby we perceive these things to which we
have hitherto been blind, and from such perception comes the sense of reality
which is lacking while we perceive nothing but appearances. Whoso has this
wider vision is freed from the limitations of the five physical senses; his memory
extends back beyond birth, and his hopes go forward beyond death ... Having all
aspects of his own nature harmoniously developed, he is at one with all aspects of
the universe, nothing is alien to him, and no form of existence is hostile. The path
of life is open before him and he treads it with joy.
D. Fortune -- The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage

61 -- Inner Truth - 61
Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject resting in himself. There will be good
fortune. If he sought to any other, he would not find rest.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Being prepared brings good fortune. If there are secret designs, it
is disquieting.

Blofeld: The officer in charge of hunting and fishing [The whole of this phrase translates
a single Chinese word. The additional commentaries in my possession differ widely in
their interpretation of this character (which has several other meanings) and of the
passage as a whole. None of them gives what seems to me a satisfactory explanation and
I must confess myself unable to interpret the meaning.] -- good fortune! The presence of
others would give rise to anxiety. [In the light of the commentary on the line which follows,
this could also be taken to mean: "Any other way than the way we are following would
make us lose our peace of mind."]

Liu: Ponder carefully. Good fortune. Other thoughts lead to anxiety.

Ritsema/Karcher: Precaution significant. Possessing this, not a swallow. (Swallow,
YEN: house swallow, martin, swift, retired from official life; easy, peaceful, private; give
a feast; relation between elder and younger brother.)

Shaughnessy: Self-satisfied auspiciousness; there are others not tranquil.

Cleary (1): Forethought leads to a good outcome. If there is something else, one is not at
rest.

Cleary (2): Preparedness leads to a good outcome, etc.

Wu: Being devoted to a single cause is auspicious. Vacillation would lead to uneasiness.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: No change has yet come over his purpose. Wilhelm/Baynes: The
will has not yet changed. Blofeld: The good fortune presaged by this line implies that our
purpose remains unaltered. Ritsema/Karcher: Purpose not-yet transformed indeed.
Cleary (2): The mind is not changed. Wu: There has been no change in purpose.

Legge: Ordinarily, we would expect line one to turn to line four as its correlate. However,
the K'ang-hsi editors contend that with the exception of lines three and six, the concept of
correlation should be discarded from the study of this hexagram. Here sincerity is focused
on inner truth, and this is the source of its power. "No change has come over his purpose"
means that sincerity, perfect in and of itself, continues undisturbed by outside influences.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man relies on his inner stability and preparedness, which are the
basis of a correct attitude toward the world. If he seeks secret ties, however, his peace of
mind and inmost sincerity will be jeopardized.

Wing: Concentrate now upon your inner virtue. Rely upon your principles and those
things you know to be true about your nature. Good fortune will come with this attitude. If
you look outside of yourself for help, you may succumb to chaos and all subsequent action
will be uncentered and improper.

Editor: There is some serious disagreement about the proper translation of this line.
Wilhelm speaks of "being prepared;" Liu renders it as an injunction to "ponder carefully."
Blofeld's version is a complete non-sequitur, and we can't help but wonder about the
meaning of the "swallow" in Ritsema/Karcher's version. Nevertheless, all of the
Confucian commentaries are closely analogous, so we can use it as our point of reference.
The image is one of an inner centeredness which seems threatened. The proper response
is an egoless receptivity to experience which has its secure foundation in Self-reliance.
One comes from one's center, ignoring peripheral inner turmoil and its reflection in outer
temptation, and thereby flows with Tao.

It was even then only after the Heyoka ceremony, in which I performed my dog
vision, that I had the power to practice as a medicine man, curing sick people; and
many I cured with the power that came through me. Of course it was not I who
cured. It was the power from the outer world, and the visions and ceremonies had
only made me like a hole through which the power could come to the two-leggeds.
If I thought that I was doing it myself, the hole would close up and no power could
come through. Then everything I could do would be foolish.
Black Elk

A. An image of self-containment -- everything you need is within you. Be true to
your Self.

B. Self-reliance implies receptivity to intuition.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject like the crane crying out in her hidden
retirement, and her young ones responding to her. It is as if it were said: "I have a cup of
good spirits," and the response were, "I will partake of it with you."

Wilhelm/Baynes: A crane calling in the shade. Its young answers it. I have a good
goblet. I will share it with you.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Blofeld: A crane sings in the shade; its young ones follow suit. [This symbolizes a
longing in which others share.] I have a fine goblet and will share it with you. [We should
allow others to benefit from something or some circumstance which is valuable to us.]

Liu: A crane calls in the shade; its young ones respond. I have a good goblet (wine, virtue)
to share with you.

Ritsema/Karcher: Calling crane located-in yin. One's son-hood harmonizing it. I
possess a loved wine-cup. Myself associating, simply spilling it.

Shaughnessy: A calling crane in the shade, its young harmonizes with it: We have a good
chalice, I will down it with you.

Cleary (1): A calling crane is in the shade, its fledgling joins it; I have a good cup, which I
will quaff with you.

Wu: A crane cries in the shade and her young chime in. “I have fine wine. I would like to
share it with you.”

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Her young ones respond to her from the common wish of the inmost
heart. Wilhelm/Baynes: This is the affection of the inmost heart. Blofeld: `Its young
ones follow suit' indicates heartfelt desire. Ritsema/Karcher: Centering the heart
desiring indeed. Cleary (2): The fledgling joining in is the heart’s desire. Wu: The
harmony comes from within.

The Master said: "The superior man occupies his apartment and sends forth his words.
If they be good, they will be responded to at a distance of more than a thousand miles --
how much more will they be so in the nearer circle! If his words be evil, they will awaken
opposition at a distance of more than a thousand miles – how much more will they do so
in the inner circle! Words issue from one's person, and proceed to affect the people.
Actions proceed from what is near, and their effects are seen at a distance. Words and
action are the spring and hinge of the superior man. The movement of that hinge and
spring determines glory or disgrace. His words and actions move Heaven and Earth --
may he be careless in regard to them?"

Legge: The young ones of the crane are represented by line one. The symbolism suggests
two men brought together by their sympathy in virtue. The subject of the line is the effect
of sincerity. As one bond of loving regard unites the mother bird and her young, so
answers the heart of man to man.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man voices his feelings and defends his deeds by clear explanations, which exert
a far-reaching chain reaction.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Wing: Here insight and influence are in their finest hour. The deeds you do, the words
you speak, resonate in the hearts and minds of others near and far. You may expect a
fortunate and beneficial response from your environment.

Editor: We see here a hidden mother bird calling to her young to share a cup of spirits.
(Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all translate "hidden retirement" as "shade.") The image is of a
mother who cannot be seen -- i.e., a hidden source. Psychologically interpreted, this
suggests the inner Self, and the shade suggests the darkness of the unconscious from
which the Self calls to us. The young birds who respond to the call are the complexes of
the psyche, including, of course, the conscious ego-complex. Despite conscious negative
associations of alcohol with intoxication, "spirits" are a common dream symbol for the
action of the spirit on consciousness. (Aqua Vitae, literally: "water of life," means alcohol
or hard liquor.) The overall image then is one of the Self and its complexes united by their
common "spirit."

As concerning the most sovereign form of soul in us we must conceive that heaven
has given it to each man as a guiding genius -- that part which we say dwells in
the summit of our body and lifts us from earth toward our celestial affinity, like a
plant whose roots are not in earth, but in the heavens. And this is most true, for it
is to the heavens, whence the soul first came to birth, that the divine part attaches
the head or root of us and keeps the whole body upright.
Plato -- The Timaeus

A. An image of affinity and connectedness which may be hidden or not readily
apparent.

B. Self and satellites united in accord: Nourishment which comes from within.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject having met with her mate. Now she
beats her drum, and now she leaves off. Now she weeps, and now she sings.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He finds a comrade. Now he beats the drum, now he stops. Now he
sobs, now he sings. [Here the source of a man’s strength lies not in himself but in his
relation to other people. No matter how close to them he may be, if his center of gravity
depends on them, he is inevitably tossed to and fro between joy and sorrow.]

Blofeld: He makes an enemy. Beating a drum by fits and starts, he weeps and sings in
turn. [We are conscious of having made an enemy, but we cannot make up our minds
what to do about it. The implication is that we should have more courage.]

Liu: One meets a person. Suddenly he beats a drum, and suddenly he stops; then he
weeps, then he sings. [You can expect to gain sometimes, but also to lose sometimes; in
happiness hides sadness, but from sadness will spring joy.]
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Ritsema/Karcher: Acquiring antagonism. Maybe drumbeating, maybe desisting. Maybe
weeping, maybe singing.

Shaughnessy: Getting an enemy: now drumming, now weary, now crying, now singing.

Cleary (1): Finding enemies, sometimes drumming, sometimes stopping, sometimes
crying, sometimes singing. [Believing in what is not to be believed will inevitably destroy
faith. This is faith that takes the false to be true.]

Cleary (2): Finding a mate ... etc. [All of this is due to lack of virtuous qualities and being
out of place.]

Wu: He meets with his counterpart. Sometimes he drums, sometimes he stops,
sometimes he wails, and sometimes he sings.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The position of the line is not the appropriate one for it. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The place is not appropriate. Blofeld: His beating the drum by fits and starts is
indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation not
appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): The position is not appropriate. Wu: Because he is out
of place. [The judgment describes how circumstances may influence the action of a
person, but makes no comments on his behaviors.]

Legge: The mate of line three is line six. Although they are matched as correlates, each is
in an inappropriate place. The idea is that sincerity, not left to itself, is influenced from
outside which causes changes and uncertainty in one's moods.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man depends on others for his joys and sorrows, which generates an uncertainty
of moods. His sincerity is impure and contaminated with external influences.

Wing: You depend upon your external relationships to dictate your mood or to gauge
your confidence in yourself. This can sometimes elevate you to the heights of joy or banish
you to the depths of despair. Possibly you may enjoy such range in emotion.

Editor: Note the close similarity between this line and line three of Hexagram #30,
Clarity: "In the light of the setting sun, men either beat the pot and sing or loudly bewail
the approach of old age. Misfortune” (Wilhelm). Here, line three is unduly influenced by
her sixth line correlate, who is portrayed as a crowing cock: an egotistical sham. Blofeld,
Shaughnessy and Cleary (1) describe an enemy; Ritsema/Karcher call it “acquiring
antagonism.” Whatever it is, the influence is not consistent with proper management of
the Work. This suggests the psychic processes of the average human being. With her
choices largely influenced by unconscious forces (which her correlate would probably call
"free will"), her life is largely determined by circumstances beyond her control. At its most
neutral, the line images the waxing and waning of fortune: "The Lord giveth, and the Lord
taketh away."
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

But this duality would seem to alternate; what is victor today is the vanquished
tomorrow; what guides us today becomes secondary and subordinate tomorrow.
And everything is equally mechanical, equally independent of will, and leads
equally to no aim of any kind. The understanding of duality in oneself begins with
the realization of mechanicalness and the realization of the difference between
what is mechanical and what is conscious. This understanding must be preceded
by the destruction of the self-deceit in which a man lives who considers even his
most mechanical actions to be volitional and conscious and himself to be single
and whole.
Gurdjieff

A. An image of inconstancy and lack of will. Unstable effort and lack of
centeredness (perhaps influenced by egotistical illusions) create consistently inconclusive
results.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject like the moon nearly full, and like a
horse pulling a chariot whose fellow disappears. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The moon nearly at the full. The team horse goes astray. No blame.

Blofeld: A team of horses strays just before the full moon -- no error!

Liu: The moon will be full. He loses a team of horses. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: The moon almost facing. The horse team extinguished. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: The moon is past full; the horse will necessarily be lost; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): The moon approaches fullness. The pair of horses is gone. No fault.

Cleary (2): The moon is almost full. When the horse’s mate disappears, there is no fault.

Wu: The moon is almost full. One horse of a pair is lost. No blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She breaks with her former companions, and mounts upwards.
Wilhelm/Baynes: It separates from its kind and turns upward. Blofeld: The straying
of the horses signifies rising above those of our own kind. Ritsema/Karcher: Cutting-off
the above, sorting indeed. Cleary (2): The horse’s mate disappearing means breaking
with peers to go higher. Wu: He forsakes the company of his own kind for the sake of
service to the one above.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Legge: Line four is magnetic and in her correct place. She has discarded her correlate
first line and hastens on to the confidence of the ruler in line five, who is symbolized as the
nearly full moon. The symbol of the horse whose fellow has disappeared has reference to
the discarding of the first line.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The team horse is the six in the third place. But the fact that there is
similarity in kind has no determining effect. The line is correct in its place and has a
receiving relationship to the ruler of the hexagram, the nine in the fifth place, whom it
serves as minister.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is humble and respectful in receiving enlightenment from superior quarters.
He is like the team horse which follows the straight course without having to look at its
mate.

Wing: Turn your attention to a superior person or a noble ideal and attempt to gain
insight into this power. In responding to a larger goal, you may leave others behind. This is
not a mistake.

Editor: According to Wilhelm, line three, the drum beating, sobbing and singing inferior
man, is here symbolized as the “team horse” who is abandoned – not line one (Legge).
This transfer of “horse-power” is psychic energy which forsakes its former pursuits to seek
illumination or en-light-enment. The message is the abandonment of futile ways to focus
on Inner Truth: Leave the cycles of weeping and singing to those who are still enamored
of them. The Waxing moon is an increasing brightness which, because it is associated with
the ruler, symbolizes a source of wisdom. The proper ego/Self relationship is implied.

And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body, as I was
saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting herself into herself
from all sides out of the body; the dwelling in her own place alone, as in another
life, so also in this, as far as she can -- the release of the soul from the chains of
the body?
Plato -- Phaedo

A. You are getting the idea. Abandon illusion and ascend toward truth -- the only
freedom lies within.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject perfectly sincere, and linking others to
him in closest union. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He possesses truth, which links together. No blame.

Blofeld: He seems to be pulled forward by his confidence in what he is doing -- no error!
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Liu: His truthfulness is steadfast. No blame. [Good fortune in everything.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity, binding thus. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: There is a return linkedly; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): With faithfulness that is firm, there is no fault.

Cleary (2): With sincerity that is firm, there is no fault.

Wu: Sincerity can unite people as if connecting them with strings. No blame.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The place of the line is the correct and appropriate one. Wilhelm/
Baynes: The place is correct and appropriate. Blofeld: This is indicated by the correct
position of this ruling line. Ritsema/Karcher: Situation correcting appropriate indeed.
Cleary (2): The position is correct. Wu: It comes from the proper position.

Legge: Line five is dynamic and in the central place of the ruler. He is the sage on the
throne whose sincerity goes forth to bind all in union with himself.

Wilhelm/ Baynes: This describes the ruler who holds all elements together by the power
of his personality. Only when the strength of his character is so ample that he can
influence all who are subject to him, is he as he needs to be. The power of suggestion must
emanate from the ruler. Without this central force, all external unity is only deception and
breaks down at the decisive moment.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The perfect sincerity of the sage on the throne binds all in union with himself.

Wing: This is the position of a true ruler. Such a person holds to virtuous goals and
principles and emanates, to those all around him, the overwhelming force of his character.
Others cling to him, and there is no blame in this.

Editor: The line and its commentaries present a highly accurate image of the
individuation process in its concentrated essence. The goal of the Work is to unite all of
the disparate aspects of the psyche into a harmonious whole. If this is the only changing
line, the hexagram becomes number forty-one, Compensating Sacrifice, the
corresponding line of which images a profound and beneficial increase: “Someone does
indeed increase him. Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it. Supreme good fortune”
(Wilhelm). Psychologically interpreted, this is the seat of the Self in the hexagram of
Inner Truth.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61

Behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
Luke 17: 21

A. Inner Truth links powers together within the psyche.

B. "The truth shall make you free."
Line-6

Legge: The topmost line, dynamic, shows its subject as chanticleer trying to mount to
heaven. Even with firm correctness there will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Cockcrow penetrating to heaven. Perseverance brings misfortune.

Blofeld: The noise of cocks crowing rises to the sky -- to persist now would bring
misfortune. [This suggests that we are over-confident and inclined to crow about our
good fortune; but we should remember that triumph seldom lasts long and avoid
seeking even greater triumphs at this time.]

Liu: The crow of a cock piercing the heavens. To continue -- misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: A soaring sound mounting, tending-towards heaven. Trial: pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The golden pheasant's sound ascends to the heavens; determination is
inauspicious.

Cleary (1): The voice of a pheasant reaches the skies; even if devoted, the outlook is bad.

Cleary (2): A rooster ascends to the skies. Self-righteousness leads to misfortune.

Wu: The crowing sound of a rooster ascends high in the sky. It will be foreboding, even
with perseverance.
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Chanticleer tries to mount to Heaven, but how can such an effort
continue long? Wilhelm/Baynes: How could such a one last long? Blofeld: For how
could this continue for long? Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore permitting long-living
indeed? Cleary (2): How can the rooster who ascends to the skies last? Wu:
How long can it last?

Legge: Line six should be magnetic, but is dynamic, and coming after line five, what can
he accomplish? His efforts will be ineffectual and self-destructive. He is symbolized as a
cock -- literally: "The plumaged voice." But a cock is not fitted to fly high, and will only
hurt himself in the attempt.
61 -- Inner Truth - 61
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Mere words cannot be relied upon. Overdependence on them leads to bad results.

Wing: Your character has developed to a point where you can make a formalized appeal
for help and allegiance in attaining ambitious aims. However, your position is not correct
for such aspirations. The pursuit of these aims brings unhappiness and remorse.

Editor: The cock is a proud and stubborn bird: loud and aggressive, it is an appropriate
symbol of a deluded ego. [Cocksure: "Given to or marked by overconfidence,
presumptuousness, lack of thoroughness or cockiness."] The sound of a cock's crowing
suggests proud words or vain ideas. His correlate is the weak and inconstant, “drumming
and sobbing” third line, and he can be seen as an over-confident ego aspiring to lead the
psyche to glory -- an illusion which can only fail and thereby retard the progress of the
Work. At worst, this implies bad faith; at best it suggests ignorance and illusion.

Reliance on one's apparent self [ego] leads to ruin. To presume to be all-knowing
is extremely harmful. Self-reliance or self-confidence means faith in the higher
self. To persist in remaining what one already is or in holding on to one's
preconceived opinions at any cost -- such self-importance is unprofitable.
Swami Turlyananda

A. Ego pride destroys the Work.

B. Don't pretend to know or try to understand what is beyond your comprehension.

Judgment

Legge: Small Powers indicates that there will be progress and attainment in small
affairs, but not in great affairs. It will be advantageous to be firm and correct. It is like the
song of a flying bird: It is better to descend than to ascend. In this way there will be good
fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Preponderance of the Small. Success. Perseverance furthers.
Small things may be done; great things should not be done. The flying bird brings the
message: It is not well to strive upward, it is well to remain below. Great good fortune.

Blofeld: The Small Get By -- success! Persistence in a righteous course brings reward.
Small things can be accomplished now, but not great ones. When birds fly high, their
singing is out of tune. The humble, but not the mighty, are favored now with great good
fortune. [To aim high now would be to put ourselves out of accord with the times.]

Liu: Slight Excess. Success. Continuing is of benefit. Undertaking small things, not
great things. The song of the flying bird. It is not good to go up; it is good to stay below.
Great good fortune. [Slight Excess signifies the slight excess or small mistake that can
prevent the achievement of great things.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Small Exceeding, Growing. Harvesting Trial. Permitting Small
Affairs. Not permitting Great Affairs. Flying bird: abandoning's sound. Above not
proper, below proper. The great significant. [This hexagram describes your situation in
terms of an overwhelming variety of encounters and details. It emphasizes that an
excessive concern with adapting yourself to these inner and outer events is the adequate
way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Small Surpassing: Receipt; beneficial to determine; possible for little
service, but not possible for great service. The sound left by the flying bird is not proper for
ascent but is proper for descent; greatly auspicious.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Cleary (1): Predominance of the small is developmental, beneficial if correct. It is
suitable for a small affair but not for a great one. The call left by a flying bird should not
rise but descend. This is very auspicious.

Cleary (2): Small excess turns out all right. It is beneficial to be correct. It is all right
for small matters, not for great matters. A flying bird leaves its cry; it should not ascend
but descend – then there will be great good fortune.

Wu: Excess of the Small indicates pervasiveness and the advantage of being
persevering. One may succeed in doing small business, but not big one. Like the lingering
sound of a bird flying by, it is not suitable to go upward, but suitable to go downward.
Great fortune.

The Image

Legge: The image of thunder above a hill forms Small Powers. The superior man, in
accordance with this, in his conduct exceeds in humility, in mourning exceeds in sorrow,
and in his expenditure exceeds in economy.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Thunder on the mountain: the image of Preponderance of the
Small. Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence. In
bereavement he gives preponderance to grief. In his expenditures he gives preponderance
to thrift. [The superior man derives an imperative from this image: he must always fix
his eyes more closely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though
this might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionally
conscientious in his actions.]

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes thunder over the mountains. The Superior Man now
acts with too much reverence, experiences too much sorrow from bereavement and is
overly thrifty in satisfying his needs.

Liu: Thunder over the mountain symbolizes Slight Excess. The superior man's conduct
is overly humble; In mourning he laments exceedingly, and he is stingy in his spending.

Ritsema/Karcher: Above mountain possessing thunder. Small Exceeding. A chun
tzu uses moving Exceeding to reach-to courtesy. A chun tzu uses losing Exceeding to
reach-to mourning. A chun tzu uses availing of Exceeding to reach-to parsimony.

Cleary (1): There is thunder over a mountain, exessively small. Thus superior people
are excessively deferential in conduct, excessively sad in mourning, excessively frugal in
consumption.

Cleary (2): Thunder over a mountain – small excess. Genteel people are exceedingly
deferential in conduct, exceedingly sad in mourning, and exceedingly abstemious in
consumption.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Wu: Thunder rolls over the mountain; this is Excess of the Small. Thus the jun zi
conducts himself with a little excess in respect to others, a little excess in sorrow at
mourning, and a little excess in frugality in expenditure.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: In Small Powers we see the magnetic lines exceeding the others,
and giving the intimation of progress and attainment. To be advantageous, such excesses
must be associated with firm correctness, and must always be in harmony with the
requirements of the time. The magnetic lines are in the central places, and hence it is said
that small excesses may be done in small affairs with good effect. Of the dynamic lines, one
is not in its proper place, and the other is not central; thus it is said that small excesses
should not be done in great affairs. In the hexagram we have the symbol of the flying bird,
whose song reminds us that it is better to descend than ascend. To ascend is contrary to
what is reasonable in the case, while to descend is natural and right.

Legge: The meaning of this hexagram in which an excess of yin lines prevails, may be
grasped by contrasting its image with that of hexagram number twenty-eight, Critical
Mass, in which an excess of yang lines prevails. Here the idea is the prevalence of small
or inferior powers, and the lesson to be learned is how to distinguish essentials from non-
essentials. Is it ever good to deviate from the established course of procedure? The answer
is that it is permissible only in small matters, but never in matters of import. Sometimes
form may be dispensed with, but never substance, and the thing must always be done
responsibly and with appropriate humility. The symbol of the bird is to teach humility -- it
is better for it to descend, keeping near to where it can perch and rest, than to ascend into
the homeless regions of the upper air.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Ground your flights of fancy.

The Superior Man bends over backwards to be correct.

Small Powers shows the preceding figure of Inner Truth turned inside-out.
Here the magnetic lines are all on the outside -- uncontained and uncontrolled. The
hexagram often reflects a situation in which the "archetypes": the passions, appetites,
emotions, drives and instincts have left their proper places within the psyche and are
flying free like birds escaped from the zoo. Most of the lines either depict the danger of
such a situation or warn about how to control it.

In this inflated, compulsive state of identity, we and the drive are at our most
harmful; the drive will unfold and we will act out its extreme, inappropriate and
destructive side. In the process we get the worst of it, along with the other people
involved. The wrong thing usually happens at the wrong time and in the wrong
place. A capacity for moving toward differentiation and transforming the drive
will not arise until the state of identity has been dissolved. This requires a
confrontation of the drive as a Thou, as something that is not I, as something

62 -- Small Powers -- 62

separate from ourselves. Only at this point can the inner dialogue begin. Until
then the drive remains unconscious, primitive and destructive. Only after the
identity has been dissolved by learning to experience the drive as an autonomous
entity that is separate from the ego, do we get a chance to choose a right time and
place and to develop the positive potential of the drive.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

Interestingly, the only line that seems to be correctly "out of its cage" is the second -

    suggesting a situation in which an intuitive inner wisdom takes proper precedence over
    the usual firm correctness of "reason."

Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, suggests the idea of a bird flying, and ascending
until the issue is evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The bird meets with misfortune through flying. [A bird ought to
remain in the nest until it is fledged. If it tries to fly before this, it invites misfortune.]

Blofeld: A bird in flight brings misfortune.

Liu: A bird encounters misfortune when it soars.

Ritsema/Karcher: Flying bird: using a pitfall.

Shaughnessy: The flying bird brings inauspiciousness.

Cleary (1): A bird that flies thereby brings misfortune.

Wu: The flying bird gets its misfortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Nothing can be done to avoid this issue. Wilhelm/Baynes: Here
there is nothing to be done. Blofeld: There is nothing we can do about it. [The bird is
merely a symbol; we are due to encounter misfortune which we are powerless to avert.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore not permitted thus indeed. Cleary (2): Nothing can be
done about it. Wu: It cannot be helped.

Legge: Line one is magnetic in a dynamic place, and possessed by the idea of exceeding
the limitations of the hexagram. Her correlate is the dynamic fourth line, belonging to the
trigram of Movement, so that instead of being repressed from her tendency to ascend, she
is actually stimulated to do so. Nothing can be done to avoid an evil issue because she
brings it on herself.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man should heed the case of a bird leaving the nest before it is
fledged. He should spend his early life learning the traditional ways in order to avoid
wasting his energies in senseless jousting.

Wing: If you are considering an extraordinary plan, forget it. The time and your position
could not be more inappropriate. Your destiny lies in the ordinary or traditional, and
anything beyond that would lead you into danger.

Editor: Despite the gloomy Confucian commentary, my experience with this line has
usually been conditional: "If the bird flies, disaster is inevitable." The implicit conclusion
is: "If the bird doesn't fly, it will escape the unpleasant consequences." The image of the
bird (an air creature symbolizes a thought, concept or idea) can suggest blue-sky thinking
that will only end up lost in space. Wilhelm’s commentary offers the idea of a fledgling
trying to fly before it is ready, suggesting that the impulse to act may be more premature
than improper.

If we do not know what moves us we are in no position to understand what we are
doing, nor are we in any position to choose what we wish to do. We may think we
decide what we want to do but what actually happens may be quite another
matter. Without an awareness of the psychic fields in which we operate, any idea
of freedom of will, decision or of relationship is an illusion.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. You have allowed your thoughts to run away with you.

B. You are in over your head -- have exceeded your ability to cope with the reality of
the situation.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject passing by her grandfather, and
meeting with her grandmother; not attempting anything against her ruler, but meeting her
as her minister. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: She passes by her ancestor and meets her ancestress. He does not
reach his prince and meets the official. No blame.

Blofeld: Passing by the spirit tablets of his ancestors, he encountered the ghost of (or else
the tablet of) his late mother. He did not get as far as the Prince but encountered one of the
ministers -- no error!

Liu: He passes over his deceased grandfather and meets his deceased grandmother. He
does not reach the king but meets an official. No blame.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Ritsema/Karcher: Exceeding one's grandfather. Meeting one's grandmother. Not
extending-to one's chief. Meeting one's servant. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Surpassing his grandfather, meeting his grandmother: Not reaching his
lord, meeting his servant; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Passing the grandfather, you meet the mother; not reaching the lord, you
meet the retainer. No fault.

Cleary (2): Going past the grandfather, etc. ... you meet the administrator, etc.

Wu: He passes by his grandfather and meets with his grandmother. He does not reach the
ruler, but meets with the minister. No error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: A minister should not overpass the ruler. Wilhelm/Baynes: The
official should not wish to surpass the prince. Blofeld: He did not reach the Prince
because he was unable to get by the minister. [We fail, but through no fault of ours, to
reach as high as we'd hoped.] Ritsema/Karcher: Not extending to one's chief. A servant
not permitted Exceeding indeed. Cleary (2): The administrator is not to be surpassed.
Wu: Because the minister should not be bypassed.

Legge: The second line is magnetic but in her proper central place. Her correlate is the
magnetic fifth-line ruler of the hexagram. The dynamic lines separating them represent
her father and grandfather, but she passes by them to meet with her grandmother in line
five. She moves toward the grandmother-ruler not as an enemy, but with the loyal
humility of a proper minister.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man fails to meet the chief executive, but goes about his duties among other
officials. He does not force his way into the limelight.

Wing: Use whatever common affiliations you have with others to bring you into a secure
position. No matter what kind of connection you make, it is the connection itself that is
important. Hold as closely as possible, however, to traditional methods.

Editor: Blofeld, Liu, Ritsema/Karcher (and Wilhelm by implication) all state that the
"grandfather" and "grandmother" are deceased ancestors. Ritsema/Karcher translate
"grandmother" as: "Second ancestor generation ... venerated as source of her many
descendants." Psychologically, we can assume that the "ancestral grandmother" relates to
a primal Yin archetype. Here, a female (Eros principle) passes by two males (logos
principle) to unite (correctly in this instance) with another yin line -- which also rules the
hexagram. Psychologically, the image suggests the subordination of intellect to a deeper
source of wisdom within the psyche. A fair paraphrase of the Confucian commentary
might be: "Don't exceed your authority." Perhaps a warning to the ego not to impose its
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

preconceived ideas on the unusual situation portrayed by this line. If this is the only
changing line, the corresponding line in the new hexagram, 32 – Consistency, is:
Remorse disappears. The relationship between correlate lines in these two hexagrams
helps explain each other. Siu’s paraphrase in the latter case is often useful: The man
endures by keeping his force of character within the bounds of available power.

The utterances of the heart -- unlike those of the discriminating intellect -- always
relate to the whole. The heartstrings sing like an Aeolian harp only to the gentle
breath of a premonitory mood, which does not drown the song but listens.
Jung -- The Symbolic Life

A. The intellect defers to the wisdom of the heart.

B. Go with your intuition.

C. Don't get ahead of yourself.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, shows its subject taking no extraordinary precautions
against danger, and some in consequence finding opportunity to assail and injure him.
There will be evil.

Wilhelm/Baynes: If one is not extremely careful, somebody may come up from behind
and strike him. Misfortune.

Blofeld: Unless he takes appropriate precautions, one of his subordinates may slay him -

    misfortune!

Liu: If he does not protect himself carefully, someone will stab him in the back.
Misfortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Nowhere Exceeding defending-against it. Adhering, maybe killing it.
Pitfall.

Shaughnessy: Not surpassing him but repelling him, following which someone injures
him; inauspicious.

Cleary (1): If you do not overcome and forestall it, indulgence will cause harm, which
would be unfortunate.

Cleary (2): One does not take precautions in excess, so pursuers attack one. This is
unfortunate.

Wu: Ignoring to secure a little excess of protection, he may be fatally wounded.
Foreboding.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There will be evil: how great it will be! Wilhelm/Baynes: What a
misfortune this is! Blofeld: Were that to happen, it would indeed be misfortune!
Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore a pitfall thus indeed. Cleary (2): Pursuers attack one.
How unfortunate! Wu: How can it not be foreboding?

Legge: The subject of line three is too confident in his own strength, and too defiant of the
magnetic enemies that seek to hurt him.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is disdainful of weak enemies and does not exercise adequate precautions
in the face of apparently insignificant signs. He will be hurt.

Wing: This is a warning. Because you are in the right and things have gone smoothly in
the past, you may be tempted to overlook details and become overly confident. Dangers
are lurking. They can be avoided with Conscientiousness. Take precautions now.

Editor: The "magnetic enemies" are all of the yin lines in the hexagram, seen here as
treacherous adversaries. There is no ambiguity in this line at all -- it is saying in the
clearest possible terms to "Watch out!"

We are therefore on safe ground when we speak of a personal part of the psyche
consisting of the conscious and controllable elements, and a nonpersonal part
consisting of those elements not controlled by the conscious I but superordinated
to and acting independently of it, often dominating it and forcing it to act
contrary to its desires ... A man in this stage of self-consciousness does not realize
as a rule that ideas occur to him without his willing them, that actions are
performed through him -- that he is being used by thoughts and impulses arising
from something other than his I.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. You are vulnerable to harm -- wake up!

B. You have taken no precautions against the threat of attack from unseen quarters.
If you are not extremely careful, you're going to get hurt.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject falling into no error, but meeting the
exigency of his situation without exceeding in his natural course. If he goes forward, there
will be peril, and he must be cautious. There is no occasion to be using firmness
perpetually.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Wilhelm/Baynes: No blame. He meets him without passing by. Going brings danger.
One must be on guard. Do not act. Be constantly persevering. [Hardness of character is
tempered by yielding position, so that no mistakes are made.]

Blofeld: No error! Instead of passing him by, he accosts him. Advancing now entails
dangers which have to be guarded against. This is not a time for action, but for unwavering
determination.

Liu: He meets things without excessive reactions. No blame. He will meet danger if he
advances. There must be caution. Do not continue.

Ritsema/Karcher: Without fault. Nowhere Exceeding meeting it. Going adversity
necessarily warning. No availing-of perpetual Trial.

Shaughnessy: There is no trouble. Not surpassing him, but meeting him; to go is
dangerous, there necessarily being a revolt. Do not herewith determine permanently.

Cleary (1): No fault. Do not dally with it too much; it is dangerous to go on. Caution is
necessary. Don’t persist forever.

Cleary (2): No fault, meeting here without excess. To go is dangerous; it is necessary to
be cautious and not do it. Always be correct.

Wu: There will be no blame, when he encounters a chance meeting with someone without
exceeding the spirit of small excess. Any excessive effort must be curtailed. Nor it is proper
to be persevering.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The position is inappropriate for a dynamic line. If he goes forward
the result would be that his course would not be long pursued. Wilhelm/ Baynes: The
place is not the appropriate one. Blofeld: Accosting someone instead of passing him by is
now inappropriate or, is indicated by the unsuitable position of this line. The danger of
going forward and the need for precaution imply that we should not continue long in our
present course. Ritsema/ Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Going adversity
necessarily warning. Completing not permitting long-living indeed. Cleary (2): The
position is not right. After all, it cannot last. Wu: This means that his position is improper.
Because it will not last.

Legge: Line four is dynamic, but the exercise of his strength is tempered by his position in
a magnetic place. He is warned however, to continue quiet and restrain himself.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man exercises restraint and caution. He meets the exigencies of the situation
without exceeding the natural bounds.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Wing: Caution: Do not forge ahead toward your goals or force issues at this time. Stay low
and remain inwardly persevering.

Editor: The image portrays a dynamic minister who might be inclined to surpass his
magnetic ruler, but who is counseled to temper his impulse to advance. "He meets him
without passing by" in Wilhelm's translation is another way of saying not to ignore the
danger in the situation. Legge's rendering: "There is no occasion to be using firmness
perpetually," Ritsema/Karcher's: "No availing-of perpetual Trial," and Shaughnessy’s
"Do not herewith determine permanently," all contradict Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu, who
translate constant perseverance. The logic of the imagery and Confucian commentary
argue for this latter rendering, though the circumstances of your query may leave the other
interpretation open for consideration. Indeed, Cleary’s Taoist and Buddhist translations
offer each version!

To put it in psychological terms, it is the unawareness of danger that constitutes
the greatest threat to one who is assailed by an uprush of primitive libido from the
unconscious. If he could see the threat or temptation clearly enough to call it by its
true name, half the battle would be won.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Don't get ahead of yourself or exceed your authority. Unilateral action is
inappropriate.

B. "Modesty is the best policy."
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, suggests the idea of dense clouds, but no rain, coming
from our borders in the west. It also shows the prince shooting his arrow, and taking the
bird in a cave.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Dense clouds, no rain from our western territory. The prince shoots
and hits him who is in the cave. [The man in the cave is line two. The word for shooting
means shooting with an arrow attached to a line for the purpose of dragging in the game
that has been shot. The connection arises from the fact that the present line and the
second line are related through similarity of kind.]

Blofeld: Dense clouds come from the western outskirts, but no rain falls. The prince
shoots an arrow and hits someone in a cave.

Liu: Heavy clouds come from the west, but no rain. What the duke shoots he takes from
the cave.

Ritsema/Karcher: Shrouding clouds, not raining. Originating- from my Western
suburbs. A prince, a string-arrow grasping another located-in a cave.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Shaughnessy: The dense clouds do not rain from our western pasture; the duke shoots
and takes the skin in the cavern.

Cleary (1): Dense clouds not raining come from my neighborhood. The ruler shoots
another in a cave.

Cleary (2): Dense clouds do not rain, coming from one’s western province. The prince
shoots, catching the quarry in the den.

Wu: There are dense clouds, but no rain coming from our western countryside. The duke
gets what is in the cave with an arrow tied to a string. [This implies that he solicits and
gets the assistance of his correlate, the second yin line.]

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: There are dense clouds, but no rain -- the line is in too high a place.
Wilhelm/Baynes: He is already above. Blofeld: Dense clouds and no rain points to
their having risen too high. [Something which could have been of great help to us passes
us by.] Ritsema/Karcher: Above climaxing indeed. Cleary (2): (The clouds) have
already risen. Wu: The clouds have been blown away by high winds.

Legge: Line five, though in the ruler's seat, is magnetic, and incapable of doing anything
great. It is a yin line, and too high. If the line were yang, the auspice would be different.
He is called the prince because of the ruler's seat, and the bird in the cave that he captures
is the subject of line two.

Anthony: To distrust our path is to distrust the Sage who guides us. We cannot make our
way in the hidden world alone; we need the Sage’s help, which can only be obtained
through a modest acceptance of our fate.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Because of the lack of able helpers, the prince is unsuccessful in his attempts to set
the world in order. He searches intently for the required talents among those who have
retired from the public scene. The right man with a demonstrated record of achievement is
finally found and the difficult task completed.

Wing: Your strength is adequate to bring forth that which you desire, but your position is
not appropriate. You will need help from others. Modestly seek such assistance from
qualified people and you can accomplish your aim.

Editor: There are two sets of images here -- the first suggests an accumulation of latent
energy and the second the grasp of something concealed. Rain symbolizes the union of
heaven and earth -- the connection between higher and lower, inner and outer. Dense
clouds therefore represent a buildup of unreleased tension: union has yet to be
accomplished. The arrow shot into the cave with a line attached to it traditionally
symbolizes the link between this line’s magnetic second-line correlate. (Meditation on the
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

differences between the two lines and their respective messages is often useful in
discerning subtle ego/Self relationships.) The arrow suggests discrimination or
comprehension -- to shoot an arrow into the heart of something is a conscious, active
attempt to pierce its essence, to comprehend it. To shoot into the darkness of a cave
symbolizes seeking comprehension of what is unknown or unconscious; it can also suggest
"a shot in the dark" -- a guess. Only Legge identifies the target as a bird – the other
translations are less specific: the object is “something or someone” hidden from
consciousness. As a creature of the air, a bird represents thoughts, ideas, concepts,
intelligible answers, etc., so this often applies in the interpretation. (Note how central the
bird symbol is in this hexagram.) The line suggests one seeking comprehension of an
unknown situation or process and receiving relatively little satisfaction -- the answer is out
of reach ("too high") in the imagery of the Confucian commentary. If this is the only
changing line, the new hexagram created is Number 31, Influence, which often carries
the connotation of “importuning” – suggesting that perhaps you are seeking information
which the oracle has no intention of providing, or you are incapable of understanding at
this stage: it’s too high, it’s beyond you. (See commentary on Hex 31 for more details.)
Also compare this line with the virtually identical message in the Judgement of Hexagram
9: ’The Taming Power of the Small has success. Dense clouds, no rain from our
western region.’ This repetition of the theme of ’smallness’ (in all of its possible
connotations) is useful to contemplate here.

Thus does the Archer hunt his quarry, for as the huntsman seeks to kill his prey for
food, so does the (Self) seek out conscious contact with its projection (the ego) for
similar reasons, for the fully illuminated man is he who is dead to the domination
of the lower worlds, using his vehicles in the lower worlds for the ends of his
higher nature.
Gareth Knight -- Qabalistic Symbolism

A. A build-up of tension without release: You are groping in the dark. Play it by ear
until the situation clarifies. Don’t get ahead of yourself.

B. The answer to your question is beyond your present ability to comprehend.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject not meeting the exigency of her
situation, and exceeding her proper course. It suggests the idea of a bird flying far aloft.
There will be evil. The case is one of calamity and self-inflicted injury.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He passes him by, not meeting him. The flying bird leaves him.
Misfortune. This means bad luck and injury.

Blofeld: Instead of accosting him, he passed him by, The bird flew away from him --
misfortune in the form of natural calamity and deliberate injury.
62 -- Small Powers -- 62

Liu: He passes over someone, not meeting him. The birds fly away. Misfortune. There
will be disaster.

Ritsema/Karcher: Nowhere meeting, Exceeding it. Flying bird radiating it. Pitfall. That
designates Calamity and Blunder.

Shaughnessy: Not meeting him, but surpassing him; the flying bird is netted in it;
inauspicious. This is called calamitous imperfection.

Cleary (1): Don’t overstay here. The flying bird is gone. This is called calamity.

Cleary (2): The flying birds leave. This is unfortunate. This is called calamity.

Wu: He meets with no one even though he applies the spirit of small excess. Like a bird
flying away from other birds, he is alone. Foreboding. It will be catastrophic.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The position indicates the habit of domineering. Wilhelm/
Baynes: He is already arrogant. Blofeld: The first sentence suggests that we behave too
arrogantly. Ritsema/Karcher: Climaxing overbearing indeed. Cleary (2): Passing by
without meeting is because of arrogance. Wu: Because he is too arrogant.

Legge: Line six is magnetic at the top of the trigram of Movement. She is possessed by
the idea of the hexagram to an extreme degree, and is incapable of keeping herself under
restraint.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man does not know how to control his preoccupation with trivia. His
overshooting and restlessly pressing on bring disappointment and calamity to himself and
his people.

Wing: Your ambitions may be too great. In an aggressive attempt to reach an unrealistic
goal you will meet with disaster.

Editor: Wilhelm and Blofeld both translate "domineering" as "arrogance," thus creating
an image of rising above one's proper station (exceeding the mean) through over-
confidence or pride. If we accept the universal symbol of the bird as emblematic of
thoughts or thought processes, the line becomes a commentary on the dangers of excessive
intellectualism. Compare this line with the sixth line of hexagram number fifty-six.

Wherever there is identity, as we have seen, there is compulsiveness. When we are
identical with a drive we never question why we are moving or where we are
going: there is only automatic response to an impulse. This state of
compulsiveness, moreover, gives us the feeling of being carried by a tremendous
force of energy, in much the same way that an automobile going at the speed of

62 -- Small Powers -- 62

eighty miles an hour may give us a feeling of exhilaration: We are really going
fast now! This exhilaration, this unquestioning feeling of assurance that "I'm
really going, and I'm going fine and well" is called inflation.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. You have missed the mark. Arrogance or overconfidence have put your head in
the clouds.

HEXAGRAM NUMBER SIXTY-THREE –
COMPLETION

Other titles: After Completion, The Symbol of What is Already Past, Already Fording,
Already Completed, Settled, Mission Accomplished, Tasks Completed, After the End, A
state of Climax

Judgment

Legge: Completion intimates progress and success in small matters. There is advantage
in firm correctness. There had been good fortune in the beginning; there may be disorder
in the end.

Wilhelm/Baynes: After Completion. Success in small matters. Perseverance furthers.
At the beginning good fortune, at the end disorder.

Blofeld: After Completion -- success in small matters! Persistence in a righteous
course brings reward. Good fortune at the start; disorder in the end. [Perhaps persistence
may help to lessen the disorder that threatens to come upon us after some initial success.]

Liu: Completion. Success in the small. It benefits to continue. Good fortune at first;
disorder in the end.

Ritsema/Karcher: Already Fording. Growing: the small. Harvesting Trial. Initially
significant. Completing: disarraying. [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of
an important move from one position to another. It emphasizes that actively proceeding
with the crossing is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Already Completed: Receipt; slightly beneficial to determine; initially
auspicious, in the end disordered.

Cleary (1): Settlement is developmental, but it is minimized. It is beneficial to be
correct. The beginning is auspicious, the end confused.

Cleary (2): Settlement is successful, even in small matters ... etc.

Wu: Mission Accomplished indicates a small degree of pervasiveness and the
advantage of being persevering. It is characterized by goodness in the beginning, but
tumult in the end.
63 -- Completion -- 63

The Image

Legge: The image of water above fire forms Completion. The superior man, in
accordance with this, thinks of the evil that may come, and guards against it in advance.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Water over fire: the image of the condition in After Completion.
Thus the superior man takes thought of misfortune and arms himself against it in advance.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes water above fire. The Superior Man deals with trouble
by careful thought and by taking advance precautions.

Liu: Water above fire symbolizes Completion. The superior man ponders danger and
takes precautions against it.

Ritsema/Karcher: Stream located above fire. Already Fording. A chun tzu uses
pondering distress and-also providing-for defending-against it.

Cleary (1): Water is above fire, Settled. Thus superior people consider problems and
prevent them.

Wu: There is water above fire; this is Mission Accomplished. Thus the jun zi
conceives ways to prevent disaster.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Progress and success in small matters, with advantage in firm
correctness. The dynamic and magnetic lines are correctly arranged, each in its proper
place. There has been good fortune in the beginning because the magnetic second line is in
the center. In the end there is a cessation of effort, and disorder arises. The course that
led to rule and order is now exhausted.

Legge: The two written Chinese characters translated here as Completion represent
two ideas -- the symbol of being past or completed, and the symbol of crossing a stream --
with a secondary meaning of helping and completing. When combined, the two characters
express the idea of successful accomplishment. The hexagram denotes the kingdom finally
at rest -- the vessel of state has been brought safely across the great and dangerous stream,
the distresses of the realm have been relieved and its disorders rectified. Small things
need to be completed: the new government must be consolidated and its ruler must,
without noise or clamor, go on to perfect what has been wrought with firm correctness and
without forgetting the inherent instability of all human affairs. That every line of the
hexagram is in its correct place, and has its proper correlate emphasizes the intimation of
progress and success.

The K'ang-hsi editors compare this hexagram and the next with number eleven,
Harmony, and number twelve, Divorcement, observing that the goodness of
Harmony is concentrated, as here, in the second line. Disorder after completion is
inevitable. All things move on with a constant process of change. Disorder succeeds
63 -- Completion -- 63

to order, and again order to disorder.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: All's well that ends well, but the new cycle demands as much willpower as the
last. Make no drastic choices during a transition.

The Superior Man anticipates conflict and is prepared for it in advance.

The sixty-third hexagram is the reference hexagram which depicts the correlation of
properly matched dynamic and magnetic lines. On the basis of this figure, all of the other
hexagrams (except the first and second, which are their "parents"), are compared. Yet,
despite the fact that every line is in its proper place, not one of them has an easy auspice,
and both the Judgment and Image are subdued and cautionary. The general idea is that as
long as we draw breath in this spacetime dimension, our lives and Work are incomplete.
Cycles complete themselves, certainly, but Completion in that sense is the "completion"
of the full moon, which as soon as it reaches maximum brilliance immediately begins to
wane.

Among those engaged in psycho-spiritual work, there is a great deal of energy
focused on "enlightenment," and the natural desire of each aspirant to attain that state of
consciousness as soon as possible. Many there are who wander from one conception of the
Work to another in the hope that this particular discipline, or that particular Guru will
provide the transcendent answer that the last one didn't.

This is a very deceptive illusion, because the chances that any given individual will
attain perfect enlightenment in any given lifetime are probably miniscule to the point of
insignificance. (How many truly enlightened beings have you ever met in your life?)

But the first signs of this symbolism are far from indicating that unity has been
attained. Just as alchemy has a great many procedures, ranging from the "work
of one day" to the "the errant quest" lasting for decades, so the tensions between
the psychic pair of opposites ease off only gradually; and, like the alchemical end-
product, which always betrays its essential duality, the united personality will
never quite lose the painful sense of innate discord. Complete redemption from the
sufferings of this world is and must remain an illusion ... The goal is important
only as an idea; the essential thing is the opus which leads to the goal: that is the
goal of a lifetime. In its attainment "left and right" are united, and conscious and
unconscious work in harmony.
Jung-- Psychology of the Transference

The Work is a slow, organic process of transforming unconscious forces, which
demands almost superhuman levels of discipline to accomplish. One can make a great
deal of progress in one lifetime, but the Work can not be said to be complete until physical
death “completes” it -- at that point, assuming the ego has acquired enough strength of will,
perhaps one can facilitate a "permanent" synthesis of the forces one has spent a lifetime in
training. Death is the doorway back to our Source, and if we enter that doorway
63 -- Completion -- 63

consciously and correctly we can consolidate a great deal of power which will serve us well
in the next cycle, in whatever dimension that cycle may take place.

It is even doubtful whether a man can arrive at the summit of all perfection as
long as he lives in an imperfect physical form, because the imperfections of the
form hamper the spirit, and only a spirit that has outgrown the necessity to live in
a physical form may be said to have arrived at that high degree of perfection at
which a perfect knowledge of self, and consequently a perfect knowledge of the
universe is obtained.
F. Hartmann -- Paracelsus: Life and Prophecies

Line-1

Legge: The first line, dynamic, shows its subject as a driver who drags back his wheel, or
as a fox which has wet his tail. There will be no error.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He brakes his wheels. He gets his tail in the water. No blame.

Blofeld: He brakes the wheel of his chariot and gets the rear part wet -- no error!

Liu: The brake to the wheel. The tail gets wet. No blame.

Ritsema/Karcher: Pulling back one's wheels. Soaking one's tail. Without fault.

Shaughnessy: Dragging his ribbon, wetting his tail; there is no trouble.

Cleary (1): Dragging the wheel, wetting the tail, there is no fault.

Cleary (2): Dragging the wheels – it is right that there be no problem.

Wu: The wheels are pulled back. The tail is immersed in water. There will be no error.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: As we may rightly judge, there will be no mistake. Wilhelm/
Baynes: According to the meaning, there is no blame in this. Blofeld: Since we manage
to stop at the right moment we are not to blame for what happens. Ritsema/Karcher:
Righteous, without fault indeed. Cleary (2): (None.) Wu: In principle there is nothing
wrong.

Legge: Line one, the first of the hexagram, represents the time immediately after the
successful completion of something -- a time for resting and being quiet. For a season at
least, all movement should be hushed. Hence we have the symbolism of a driver trying to
stop his carriage, and a fox who has wet his tail, and will not attempt the stream again.
63 -- Completion -- 63
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man is not caught in the intoxication of the masses during a great
transition. The general pressure finally overwhelms him. However, this occurs only at the
last minute, after he has successfully completed the enterprise.

Wing: As you move forward with your plans, the pressure starts to build and you feel an
urge to reconsider. You must face the fact that you will be affected by the events that you
have inexorably set into motion, but not detrimentally, as you are generally correct.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all use the image of brakes to stop a wheel. If the
hexagram is turned upside down it becomes number sixty-four, Before Completion or
Unfinished Business, and this line becomes number 64:6 which has a similar message.
Even the fox is mentioned. The image is one of avoiding danger by holding back.

The contented man meets no disgrace;
Who knows when to stop runs into no danger --
He can long endure.
Lao Tzu

A. Stop pushing -- hold and consolidate your position.

B. "Leave well enough alone."
Line-2

Legge: The second line, magnetic, shows its subject as a wife who has lost her carriage-
screen. There is no occasion to go in pursuit of it. In seven days she will find it.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The woman loses the curtain of her carriage. Do not run after it; on
the seventh day you will get it.

Blofeld: The lady loses the blind from her chariot window. She should not go in search of
it, for she will recover it in seven days.

Liu: A lady loses her carriage curtain. Without seeking it, it will be regained within seven
days.

Ritsema/Karcher: A wife losing her veil. No pursuit. The seventh day: acquiring.

Shaughnessy: The wife loses her hair; do not follow, in seven days you will get it.

Cleary (1): A woman loses her protection. Do not pursue; you will get it in seven days.

Cleary (2): A woman loses her protection. Let her not give chase: she will find it in seven
days.
63 -- Completion -- 63

Wu: A woman has lost the curtain of her carriage. There is no need to look for it. After
seven days it will be found.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The course pursued is that indicated by the central position of the
line. Wilhelm/Baynes: As a result of the middle way. Blofeld: Restraint or
moderation will be rewarded. Ritsema/Karcher: Using centering tao indeed. Cleary
(2): Because of her balanced course. Wu: Because she take a middle course.

Legge: The second line is magnetic and in her proper place. With her dynamic correlate
in line five, she might be expected to take action, but she is central and correct – a lady
who has lost her carriage screen. She will not advance further so soon after success has
been achieved, but keeps herself in hidden retirement. Let her not seek the screen. The
seven days is a cycle of completion running its course -- then a new period when action
will be proper shall have commenced.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is not accorded the protective confidence of his superiors. In his desire to
achieve something, he is tempted to seek it and draw it to himself. He should not do so,
but should remain patient and faithful. What is truly his will come to him eventually.

Wing: You are suddenly exposed, whether by your own hand or by circumstances beyond
your control. Do nothing. Don't try to cover up, or attempt to make a case for your position.
This time of conspicuousness will soon pass.

Editor: The image of the hexagram suggests a high water mark -- the point at which a
cycle is completed. Beyond this point is the beginning of a whole new cycle. The second
line is the ruler of the hexagram -- a magnetic, receptive, yin line who remains fully
devoted to the dynamic yang line, her husband, in the fifth place. A magnetic force is
vulnerable during a period of completion -- it must remain in place until the synthesis is
complete and the next cycle begins.

When a patient begins to feel the inescapable nature of his inner development, he
may easily be overcome by a panic fear that he is slipping helplessly into some
kind of madness he can no longer understand. More than once I have had to reach
for a book on my shelves, bring down an old alchemist, and show my patient his
terrifying fantasy in the form in which it appeared four hundred years ago. This
has a calming effect, because the patient then sees that he is not alone in a strange
world which nobody understands, but is part of the great stream of human history,
which has experienced countless times the very things that he regards as a
pathological proof of his craziness.
Jung -- Alchemical Studies

A. An image of temporary vulnerability: take no action until the situation matures.
63 -- Completion -- 63
Line-3

Legge: The third line, dynamic, suggests the case of Kao Tsung who attacked the Demon
region, but was three years in subduing it. Inferior men should not be employed in such
enterprises.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The Illustrious Ancestor disciplines the devil's country. After three
years he conquers it. Inferior people must not be employed.

Blofeld: The Illustrious Ancestor (namely, the Emperor Wu Ting, 1324 BC) carried out a
punitive expedition in Kuei Fang (literally, the Land of the Devils) and conquered it after
three years -- men of mean attainments would have been useless! [The Land of Devils
was probably a territory inhabited by non-Chinese tribes. The implication is that only a
man of outstanding capability should attempt any difficult task now.]

Liu: The emperor Kao Tsung chastised the barbarian country and conquered it in three
years. The inferior man should no longer be employed.

Ritsema/Karcher: The high ancestor subjugating souls on-all- sides. Three years-
revolved controlling it. Small People, no availing of.

Shaughnessy: The High Ancestor attacks the Devil-land, in three years conquering it;
the little man should not use it.

Cleary (1): The emperor attacks the barbarians, and conquers them after three years. Do
not employ inferior people.

Wu: Gao Zong took military actions against Guifan. After three years, he quelled the
rebellion. Little men should not be trusted.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He was three years in subduing it -- enough to make him weary.
Wilhelm/Baynes: This is exhausting. Blofeld: His taking three years to conquer it
indicates great fatigue. [Even if we do feel capable of undertaking an extremely difficult
task, we must expect it to occupy us for so long as to make us feel exhausted.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Weariness indeed. Cleary (2): He is weary. Wu: It was a tiresome
campaign.

Legge: The dynamic third line at the top of the lower trigram suggests the idea of one
undertaking a vigorous enterprise. The writer thinks of Kao Tsung, one of the ablest
sovereigns of the Shang dynasty (B.C. 1364-1324), who undertook an expedition against
the barbarian hordes of the cold and bleak regions north of the Middle States. His
enterprise was successful, but it was tedious, and the line concludes with a warning.
63 -- Completion -- 63
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: A correct subjugation policy is essential after the conquest. Inferior people, of no
value at home, should not be sent to govern the colonies. Protracted struggles usually
follow, and small men are inadequate to the task.

Wing: The attainment of a highly ambitious goal is possible. It will take a long time and
will leave you spent. If it is worthwhile to you, success is indicated. However, be cautioned
to employ only the most qualified persons in your endeavor.

Editor: In psychological terms, the Demon region is the unconscious psyche, and no new
synthesis can take place therein until all of its autonomous complexes have been pacified
and integrated. The will of the ego is the last line of defense against their constant
pressure. Only one who has undertaken the Work can truly appreciate how exhausting it
is -- a fact made more ominous by the realization that one can win most of the battles and
still lose the war. "Inferior men should not be employed" means that it is a task not to be
lightly undertaken by anyone.

When an individual in some contretemps discovers this primitive force alive
within him, like a ruthless and cold-blooded daemon, he must find some method
by which it can be transformed into a different kind of spirit, if he is to avoid a
regression to a level of civilization far below his conscious standard.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. Conquer your demons -- the integration of unbalanced forces is a long and
exhausting process.
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, magnetic, shows its subject with rags provided against any leak in
her boat, and on guard all day long.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The finest clothes turn to rags. Be careful all day long.

Blofeld: Amidst the fine silk are ragged garments -- be cautious throughout the livelong
day!

Liu: One has silk clothes but wears rags. Be cautious all day. [This line indicates that you
can expect to have enough money to live comfortably.]

Ritsema/Karcher: A token: possessing clothes in-tatters. Completing the day, a warning.
[Token, HSU: halves of a torn piece of silk which identify the bearers when joined.]

Shaughnessy: The short coat has jacket wadding; in winter days be warned.

Cleary (1): With wadding to plug leaks, one is watchful all day.
63 -- Completion -- 63

Cleary (2): There are rags in fine cloth – be alert all the time.

Wu: Rags are used to plug leaks. This is a matter of concern all day long.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: She is on guard all the day -- she is in doubt about something.
Wilhelm/Baynes: There is cause for doubt. Blofeld: This indicates that doubt and
suspicion are now prevalent. Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing a place to doubt indeed.
Cleary (2): There is doubt. Wu: There are doubts.

Legge: Line four is magnetic and has advanced into the trigram symbolizing Water and
Peril. She will be cautious and prepare for evil.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Evils are occasionally uncovered but quickly glossed over during periods of prosperity
and cultural advance. The man is not complacent about such readily hidden defects and
takes earnest steps toward their correction.

Wing: Elements of decay can be found in the situation of your inquiry. Watch your step.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu all juxtapose the image of rags with clothing, or fine silk.
The message is to not be deluded by what seems to be a favorable situation. Maintain
constant awareness and make your choices with extreme care. Regardless of appearances
you're in a position of risk.

Complexes that are not granted reality by consciousness and are not dealt with as
"powers" to be taken seriously, but are dealt with by repression, tend to take hold
in an unadapted, primitive, regressive, compulsive and destructive fashion. This
results in what we call neurotic or psychotic disturbances.
E.C. Whitmont -- The Symbolic Quest

A. Something valuable is threatened -- extreme care is called for.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, dynamic, shows its subject as the neighbor in the east who
slaughters an ox for his sacrifice; but this is not equal to the small spring sacrifice of the
neighbor in the west, whose sincerity receives the blessing.

Wilhelm/Baynes: The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox does not attain as
much real happiness as the neighbor in the west with his small offering.
63 -- Completion -- 63

Blofeld: In terms of benefits, the neighbor to the east gained less from sacrificing an ox
than the neighbor to the west obtained from carrying out the spring sacrifice.

Liu: The eastern neighbor sacrificed an ox; the western neighbor made a simple offering,
but he received the blessing. [Many will succeed in small undertakings but fail in grand
schemes.]

Ritsema/Karcher: The Eastern neighbor slaughters cattle. Not thus the Western
neighbor's dedicated offering. The substance: acquiescing-in one's blessing.

Shaughnessy: The eastern neighbor kills an ox to sacrifice; it is not as good as the
western neighbor's spring sacrifice in really receiving its blessing; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Slaughtering an ox in the neighborhood to the east is not as good as the
ceremomy in the neighborhood to the west, really receiving the blessing.

Cleary (2): ... The genuine get the blessings.

Wu: The neighbor on the east side slaughters an ox. What he does is less rewarding than
the neighbor on the west side, who makes simple offerings in the summer and receives an
abundance of blessings.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The large sacrifice of the eastern neighbor cannot equal the small
sacrifice of the western neighbor because the latter is in harmony with the times.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The eastern neighbor, who slaughters an ox, is not as much in
harmony with the time as the western neighbor. The latter attains true happiness: good
fortune comes in great measure. Blofeld: Because the former's sacrifice (though bigger)
was less timely. The benefits obtained by the neighbor to the west betoken that good
fortune is on its way to us. [This is one of the favorite themes of the Book of Change,
namely the importance of timeliness. A small effort at the right time will win for us more
benefit than a gigantic effort at the wrong time.] Ritsema/Karcher: Significant, the
great coming indeed. Cleary (2): Good fortune comes in great measure. Wu: There
comes great fortune.

Legge: The neighbor in the east is line five, and the neighbor in the west is line two -- his
correlate. Five is dynamic, and two is magnetic, and magnetic passivity is more likely to be
patient and cautious under the prevailing circumstances. They are compared to two men
sacrificing. The one presents valuable offerings, the other very poor ones, but the second
excels in sincerity, and his small offering is the more acceptable.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Men are deceived by what the eyes see, but the gods are swayed by what the heart
conceals.
63 -- Completion -- 63

Wing: This is an inappropriate time for ostentatious exhibitions of personal success and
grandeur. Look for true happiness in the simplicity of your life. You will achieve more by
small efforts than by large displays of power.

Editor: The superior neighbor is the magnetic line two in the middle of the trigram of
Clarity, who understands the true difference between form and substance. The inferior
neighbor is the dynamic and ego-centric line five in the middle of the trigram of Peril, who
acts on his own initiative and wastes his effort. The image teaches the difference between
acting from the ego or the Self: between pushing the river and flowing with it.

More acceptable is the character of one upright of heart than the ox of the
evildoer ... The god is aware of him who acts for him.
Instruction for king Meri-ka-re -- Egypt, C. 2000 B.C.

A. A modest but sincere effort is superior to a great show of force. Small increments
of real advancement are worth more than illusions of completion.

B. Complexity fails; simplicity succeeds.

C. The situation requires a modest condescension of power or display of allegiance,
not a grandiose expression of martyrdom.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, magnetic, shows its subject with even her head immersed. The
position is perilous.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He gets his head in the water. Danger.

Blofeld: His head gets wet -- trouble!

Liu: His head gets wet. Danger. [Avoid evil persons lest you yourself become tainted.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Soaking one's head. Adversity.

Shaughnessy: Wetting his head; danger.

Cleary (1): When the head gets wet, one is in danger.

Cleary (2): Getting the head wet is dangerous.

Wu: The fox immerses his head in water. Perilous.
63 -- Completion -- 63
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: How could such a state continue long? Wilhelm/Baynes: How can
one endure this for long? Blofeld: But this sort of trouble can scarcely last long. [We
must expect some trouble but perhaps not very serious and not likely to endure.]
Ritsema/Karcher: Wherefore permitting lasting indeed? Cleary (2): How can one last
long? Wu: How long can it last?

Legge: The topmost line is magnetic and on the outermost edge of the trigram of Peril.
Her action is violent and dangerous, like that of one attempting to cross a ford and being
plunged over her head in the water.

Anthony: We “look back” when we presume that the struggle is over, that we can relax
and enjoy the situation. We must be firm and go forward, or the work will be undone.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Needless violence and self-glorification upon completion of a difficult undertaking
cause the man to fall back into misfortune.

Wing: You have initiated significant action. Do not assume that things will follow their
course while you simply watch and wait. This type of attitude is both vain and perilous.
You have created responsibilities for yourself. Shirking them will invite grave danger.

Editor: Wilhelm's commentary suggests the idea of not turning back after making a
dangerous transition. The situation has not yet been consolidated and can easily
deteriorate: what might be Completion can instead become an aborted synthesis and a
regression to a lower level. Alternately, Legge’s image of the line with “even her head
immersed” suggests wooly-headedness – you aren’t seeing things clearly. This prevents a
transition to a clear state of consciousness. Symbolically to have one’s head immersed in
water portrays thought overwhelmed by emotion.

Another said, "I will follow you, sir, but first let me go and say good-bye to my
people at home." Jesus said to him, "Once the hand is laid on the plow, no one who
looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
Luke 9: 61-62

A. You have passed the point of no return in the current cycle of growth --
regression now portends disaster.

B. You've gone too far to turn back now.

C. Your incomprehension prevents illumination in the matter at hand.

D. Emotions prevent clear thinking.

March 26, 2001, 3/20/09
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64
HEXAGRAM NUMBER SIXTY-FOUR –
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

Other titles: Before Completion, The Symbol of What is not yet Past, Not-yet Fording,
Not Yet Completed, Tasks yet to be Completed, Not yet, Yet to be, Before the End, Mission
yet Unaccomplished, A State of Transition

Judgment

Legge: Unfinished Business suggests successful progress, but if the young fox that
has nearly crossed the stream gets his tail wet, there will be no advantage.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Before Completion. Success. But if the little fox, after nearly
completing the crossing, gets his tail in the water, there is nothing that would further.

Blofeld: Before Completion -- success! Before the little fox has quite completed its
crossing of the ice, its tail gets wet. [This implies that we are to expect a setback in our
plans.] No goal (or destination) is favorable now. [Hence this is a time for waiting and for
drawing in our horns. That the LAST of the sixty-four hexagrams should be Before
Completion rather than After Completion (#63) may seem surprising until it is recalled
that there is nothing final about it; the cycle of change continues, passing from hexagram
#64 onto the first hexagram, and so on eternally.]

Liu: Before Completion. Success. A young fox almost across wets his tail in the water.
Nothing benefits.

Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet Fording, Growing. The small fox, a muddy Ford. Soaking
one's tail: without direction: Harvesting. (Without direction: Harvesting, WU YU Li:
no plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not
impose a direction on events.) [This hexagram describes your situation in terms of being
on the edge of an important change of situation. It emphasizes that waiting and
accumulating energy to begin the upcoming move is the adequate way to handle it...]

Shaughnessy: Not Yet Completed: Receipt; the little fox at the point of fording, wets
his tail; there is no place beneficial.

Cleary (1): Being as yet unsettled is developmental. A small fox, having nearly crossed
the river, gets its tail wet, does not succeed.

Cleary (2): Being unsettled leads to success. A little fox, almost crossing, gets its tail
wet. Nothing is gained.
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

Wu: Mission yet Unaccomplished indicates pervasiveness. A little fox almost makes
it crossing the river, but gets its tail wet. Nothing is gained.

The Image

Legge: Fire over water -- the image of Unfinished Business. The superior man
carefully discriminates among the qualities of things, and the different positions they
naturally occupy.

Wilhelm: Fire over water: the image of the condition before transition. Thus the
superior man is careful in the differentiation of things, so that each finds its place.

Blofeld: This hexagram symbolizes fire above water. The Superior Man takes care to
distinguish between things before arranging them in order.

Liu: Fire above water symbolizes Before Completion. The superior man carefully
distinguishes things, and puts them in their appropriate place.

Ritsema/Karcher: Fire located above stream. Not-yet Fording. A chun tzu uses
considering to mark-off the beings residing on-all-sides.

Cleary (1): Fire is above water, not yet settled. Thus superior people carefully discern
things and keep them in their places.

Cleary (2): Fire over water – unsettled.

Wu: There is fire above water; this is Mission yet Unaccomplished. Thus the jun zi
makes careful distinction of things and their proper places of being.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Progress and success are suggested by the magnetic fifth line in the
ruler's place. Although he has nearly crossed the stream, the young fox has not yet
escaped from the midst of danger and calamity. Getting his tail wet means that the end
does not reflect the intent of the beginning. Although the places of the different lines are
not those appropriate to them, yet a dynamic and a magnetic line always respond to each
other.

Legge: Unfinished Business is the reverse of Completion: it means that the
successful accomplishment of the matter at hand has not yet been realized; the crossing of
the great stream is as yet incomplete.

Some have wished that the I Ching might have concluded with Completion, and
the last hexagram have left us with the picture of human affairs all brought to good order.
But this would not have been in harmony with the idea of change. Again and again it has
been pointed out that we find in the book no idea of a perfect and abiding state. Just as
the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever-recurring round, so it is with the phases
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

of society. The reign of order has peaked and declined, and this hexagram calls us to
renew the struggle to make things right again. It deals with the conduct necessary to
secure this result.

Not one of the lines in the hexagram is in its correct place -- all the dynamic lines
are in magnetic places, and the magnetic lines are in dynamic places. At the same time,
each of them has a proper correlate, so there is the possibility of some progress.

The symbol of the fox suggests a want of caution on the part of those who try to
remedy prevailing disorders. They are unsuccessful and thereby get themselves into
trouble. Line two represents this state of mind -- he is dynamic in a magnetic place in the
center of the trigram of Peril. He is restless, and attracted by his magnetic correlate in the
fifth place, he will be incautious in taking action. The outcome of the issue will be different
than what was intended at the beginning.

The trigram of Water is below, and Fire above, showing how the two principles
cannot act on each other profitably. This symbolizes the unregulated condition of general
affairs now prevailing.
NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Judgment: Although many achievements fuel our growth, the ego is only the facilitator,
not the doer. To ignore this truth creates negative consequences: don't destroy the Work!

The Superior Man critically examines the situation and re-checks his priorities.

This hexagram represents the time before the climax of a cycle, just as the
preceding figure symbolizes the time after the climax (and hence the transition to a new
beginning). The Work is by no means "almost over" -- the lines all match as correlates, but
every one of them unites "upside-down," so to speak. (Turn the hexagram over, and then
they are in perfect correlation.) That the superior man "discriminates among the qualities
of things, and the different positions they naturally occupy" means that he knows that the
correct positions of the lines (the ones they "naturally occupy") are as in hexagram number
sixty-three, not this one.

This "backward correlation of lines" is arguably a fair image of the relationship of
thoughts and feelings in the average human psyche. The stresses of life are what
eventually break up these mismatched correlates through endless cycles of stimulus and
response until they finally all unite correctly in a hypothetical "Completion of the Great
Work." That this is an ideal rather than a humanly attainable goal is suggested in this
quote from Shao Yung:

The principle of the Way finds its full development in Heaven; the principle of
Heaven, in Earth; the principle of Earth, in the myriad things; and that of the
myriad things, in man. One who knows how the principles of Heaven, Earth, and
all things find their full development in man can give full development to his
people.

64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

For all practical purposes, it is wisest to aspire to attainable completions and realize
that the Work's "full development" is the Self's, not the ego's responsibility.

To strive for perfection is a high ideal. But I say: "Fulfill something you are able
to fulfill rather than run after what you will never achieve." Nobody is perfect.
Remember the saying: "None is good but God alone" [Luke 18:19], and nobody
can be. It is an illusion. We can modestly strive to fulfill ourselves and to be as
complete human beings as possible, and that will give us trouble enough.
Jung -- The Tavistock Lectures

The Judgment suggests that before any climax or resolution there may still exist an
indeterminate amount of free choice to influence the outcome -- only the specific
circumstances can suggest how much or how little. As always, the choices are defined
within the structure of the situation. The magnetic ruler in the fifth place implies that a
favorable outcome is possible, but only through clear perception and willpower can it
come about.

The conditional interpretation (boldface italics added) in both Legge's and
Wilhelm's translation of the Judgment is necessary for its text to make sense. Note that
Ritsema/Karcher define "Without direction: Harvesting" as: "No plan or direction is
advantageous; in order to take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on
events." This is a common oracle response, and sharpens the meaning here. Line one
depicts the negative consequences of ignoring the Judgment’s explicit message.
Line-1

Legge: The first line, magnetic, shows its subject like a fox whose tail gets immersed.
There will be occasion for regret.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He gets his tail in the water. Humiliating.

Blofeld: Its tail gets wet -- disgrace! [If we receive this moving line, the setback is likely
to be discreditable to us.]

Liu: He wets his tail. Humiliation.

Ritsema/Karcher: Soaking one's tail. Abashment.

Shaughnessy: Wetting his tail; distress.

Cleary (1): Getting the tail wet, one is humiliated.

Cleary (2): Getting the tail wet is humiliating.

Wu: The tail is immersed. Humiliating.
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: This is the very height of ignorance. Wilhelm/Baynes: For he
cannot take the end into view. Blofeld: This also implies that we do not know how to take
advantage of opportunities. Ritsema/Karcher: Truly not knowing the end indeed.
Cleary (2): One still does not know the limit. Wu: It shows the subject is clumsy.

Legge: Line one is magnetic, at the bottom of the trigram of Peril, and responds to the
dynamic fourth line who is not in his correct place. She attempts action but finds cause to
regret it.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: At the outset, the man attempts to advance in a frenzy during times of disorder in
pursuit of tangible accomplishments. This only leads to humiliation, since the time for
good results is not at hand.

Wing: There is a strong urge to end a chaotic situation, yet it is not the time for
clearheaded action. You do not see clearly all of the implications and consequences of your
actions. Any actions will bring you problems and, perhaps, disgrace.

Editor: This line portrays the negative interpretation of the conditional Judgment. You
are vulnerable to detrimental influences -- this could be due to either arrogance or
ignorance, or both. The line often refers to going too far, or forcing an issue. Compare
with line 63:6: Wilhelm/Baynes: "He gets his head in the water. Danger."

The people who fancy they are sure of themselves are the ones who are truly
unsure ... In the long run it is the better adapted man who triumphs, not the
wrongly self-confident, who is at the mercy of dangers from without and within.
Jung -- Depth Psychology and Self-Knowledge

A. Your assumptions in the matter at hand are premature and ignorant of their
consequences.

B. You are rashly presumptuous.
Line-2

Legge: The second line, dynamic, shows its subject dragging back the carriage wheel.
With firmness and correctness there will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: He brakes his wheels. Perseverance brings good fortune.

Blofeld: He brakes the wheel of the chariot -- righteous persistence brings good fortune!
[But note that he uses his brake; i.e. our persistence must be in the form of determination
to halt now and proceed later.]
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

Liu: He brakes the wheel. Continuing -- good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Pulling-back one's wheels. Trial: significant.

Shaughnessy: Dragging his sash; determination.

Cleary (1): Dragging the wheels, it bodes well to be upright.

Cleary (2): ... Rectitude is auspicious.

Wu: He pulls back the wheels. Perseverance brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He is in the central place, and his action thereby becomes correct.
Wilhelm/Baynes: The second line has good fortune if it is persevering. It is central and
hence acts correctly. Blofeld: Namely, the good fortune of being able to steer a middle
course and go straight forward. [If events permit us to interpret the braking of the wheel
as a recent success in preventing ourselves being dragged into a wrong course, then all
is well and there is no need to halt now.] Ritsema/ Karcher: Centering using moving
correcting indeed. Cleary (2): Its activity is balanced. Wu: It is the correct way to go
from the center.

Legge: Line two is dynamic, in the center, and is able to repress himself. He keeps the
vehicle from advancing and there is good fortune. The K'ang-hsi editors observe that a
dynamic line in the second place and a magnetic line in the fifth place are both incorrect,
and yet with firm correctness in their subjects there will be good fortune -- such is the
virtue of the central position.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man represses untimely actions through patient control of his strength, while
remaining steadfast in his resolve.

Wing: Even though you may know what must be done, the time is not right for action.
Exercise patience and develop strength. If you maintain an inner determination to proceed
when the opportunity presents itself, you will be successful. Do not allow this delay to turn
you away from your goal.

Editor: Wilhelm, Blofeld and Liu use the more forceful image of "brakes" instead of
"dragging a wheel." The image is one of halting forward motion: Action will harm the
Work unless it is stopped immediately. It is wise to remember Ritsema/Karcher's advice
in the Judgment here: "No plan or direction is advantageous; in order to take advantage
of the situation, do not impose a direction on events."
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

For as man gradually emerges from unconsciousness and learns to subdue his
instinctive nature, making it serve him and his needs, he possesses himself of the
energy that formerly resided in the natural process.
M.E. Harding -- Psychic Energy

A. "Cease and desist."

B. Slow down; curb your impatience to advance; control your enthusiasm; restrain
your flights of fancy.
Line-3

Legge: The third line, magnetic, shows its subject with the state of things not yet
remedied, advancing on; which will lead to evil. But there will be advantage (Sic) in trying
to cross the great stream.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Before completion, attack brings misfortune. It furthers one (Sic) to
cross the great water.

Blofeld: The crossing is incomplete, so to advance now would bring misfortune; yet it
will be advantageous (Sic) to cross the great river (or sea). [The second and third clauses
of this passage appear contradictory; but not if we interpret them to mean that, though
we must halt for a while, we should preserve our determination to go forward to the end
when conditions warrant an advance.]

Liu: Before completion achieving success, continuing -- misfortune. It is beneficial (Sic)
to cross the great water. [This line indicates frustration.]

Ritsema/Karcher: Not-yet Fording, chastising: pitfall. Harvesting: wading the Great
River. (Sic)

Shaughnessy: Not yet completed; to be upright is inauspicious; beneficial (Sic) to ford
the great river.

Cleary (1): As yet unsettled, it bodes ill to go on an expedition, but it is beneficial (Sic) to
cross great rivers.

Cleary (2): While unsettled, etc.

Wu: In time of Mission yet Unaccomplished, going forward is foreboding, but
crossing the great river is advantageous (Sic).
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: Advancing will lead to evil. The place of the line is not that
appropriate for it. Wilhelm/Baynes: The place is not the appropriate one. Blofeld:
The first part of this passage is suggested by the line's unsuitable position. Ritsema/
Karcher: Situation not appropriate indeed. Cleary (2): The position is inappropriate.
Wu: The position is improper.

Legge: The K'ang-hsi editors say that it is very difficult to understand what is said under
line three, and many critics suppose that a negative has dropped out, and that we should
really read that "It will not be advantageous to try to cross the great stream."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The time is ripe for transition, but the man lacks sufficient strength to act alone.
Advancing under these conditions would mean disaster.

Wing: The continuing pursuit of your aim will bring you frustration because it cannot be
achieved within your current situation. If you must achieve this particular goal, it would be
better to begin anew, with the aid of new friends. Otherwise you may dull your energies
and vision with discouragement.

Editor: There is serious ambiguity here. I asked the oracle to comment on the situation
of this line, and received hexagram 18:4 -- "You cannot succeed until you rectify a past
mistake." Then I asked what would be the effect of adding the negative to the line, and
received hexagram 22:2 and 5 -- "Form follows function," and, "A small offering is
appreciated." As far as I am concerned, the answer is clear: the line doesn't make sense
unless the negative is replaced. We are dealing with a book which was first written down in
1143 BC, and copied by hand for more than two-thousand years before it was first printed.
In editing this edition I have caught myself making copying errors more than once, so it is
easy to appreciate the problems involved in maintaining accuracy over millennia.

Addendum, 01/16/06: I asked the oracle to comment again on my interpretation of this
line and received hexagram 61, Inner Truth, without changing lines.

The wise man sees evil coming and avoids it,
the fool is rash and presumptuous.
Proverbs 14: 16

A. The Work is incomplete. To push ahead blindly can only lead to confusion.

B. Don't force an incomplete transition.

C. "Don't push the river."
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64
Line-4

Legge: The fourth line, dynamic, shows its subject by firm correctness obtaining good
fortune, so that all occasion for repentance disappears. Let him stir himself up, as if he
were invading the Demon region, where for three years rewards will come to him and his
troops from the great kingdom.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. Shock, thus
to discipline the Devil's Country. For three years, great realms are awarded.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings reward and regret vanishes. The
subjugation of the land of Kuei involved tremendous activity; but, at the end of three years,
great territories were bestowed upon the successful generals. [This implies that we must
work and, perhaps, suffer much in order to gain the fulfillment of our will promised in
the commentary on this line.]

Liu: Continuing -- good fortune. Remorse vanishes. Great power is used to attack the land
of the barbarians. Within three years, rewards from the Great Country.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant, repenting extinguished. Shake avails-of
subjugating souls on-all-sides. Three years- revolved, possessing donating tending-
towards the great city.

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious; regret is gone. Zhen herewith attacks the
Devil-land, in three years having a reward from the great state.

Cleary (1): Remaining correct brings good results, regret vanishes; rising up to conquer
the barbarians, in three years one will have the reward of a great country.

Cleary (2): Correctness brings good results; regret vanishes. Vigorously acting to conquer
barbarians, etc.

Wu: To be persevering is auspicious and regrets will disappear. A general was appointed
to conquer Guifan and decorated accordingly after three years.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The aim of the subject of the line is carried into effect. Wilhelm/
Baynes: What is willed is done. Blofeld: The reward to be gained by persistence and the
disappearance of regret both imply that what we will come about. Ritsema/Karcher:
Purpose moving indeed. Cleary (2): The aim is carried out. Wu: The aspiration has
prevailed.

Legge: The dynamic fourth line is in a magnetic place, which might hinder his endeavors
to bring about better conditions. But he is firm and correct, and in the place of the minister
next to the magnetic ruler, who is humble and prepared to welcome the fourth line's
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

endeavors. Let him exert himself vigorously and long, as Kao Tsung did in his famous
expedition (see hexagram 63:3), and he will make progress and have success. Expeditions
beyond the frontier in those days were not very remote. Contact was maintained between
the army and the court, and rewards and encouragement were often sent to the troops in
the field. Ch'eng-tzu says: "The subject of line four has the ability which the time requires,
and possesses also a firm solidity. He can carry out his purpose. There will be good
fortune and all occasion for repentance will disappear. The smiting of the demon region
was the highest example of firm correctness."

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The time for fierce struggles against the forces of decadence has arrived. The man
lays the foundation of power and mastery for the future with vigor. Misgivings are to be
silenced. Rewards will come later.

Wing: There is an unavoidable struggle at hand, perhaps a battle of principles. Develop
discipline and determination, for the battle must be fought without misgiving to the end.
Rewards will come later. Good fortune.

Editor: The Demon region is also mentioned in the third line of hexagram number sixty-
three, Completion. It is interesting to note that when this hexagram is turned upside
down it becomes hexagram number sixty-three, and line 64:4 is thereby transformed into
line 63:3, which see. Psychologically, "the Demon region" is the unintegrated psyche,
inhabited by autonomous complexes. The Great Kingdom is the One, the integrated
psyche, the abode of the Self.

Therefore know the Self, who is superior to the understanding, control the [ego] by
the Self, and destroy, O mighty Arjuna, the enemy, who comes in the guise of
desire and is hard to overcome.
Bhagavad-Gita 3: 42-43

A. Be firm in a vulnerable position -- a warrior's determination integrates the
psyche.
Line-5

Legge: The fifth line, magnetic, shows its subject by firm correctness obtaining good
fortune, and having no occasion for repentance. We see in her the brightness of superior
intelligence, and the possession of sincerity. There will be good fortune.

Wilhelm/Baynes: Perseverance brings good fortune. No remorse. The light of the
superior man is true. Good fortune.

Blofeld: Persistence in a righteous course brings good fortune and absence of regret. The
lustre of the Superior Man wins people's confidence -- hence the good fortune.
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

Liu: Continuing -- good fortune. No remorse. The glory of the superior man wins the
confidence of the people. Good fortune.

Ritsema/Karcher: Trial: significant, without repenting. A chun tzu’s shining. Possessing
conformity, significant.

Shaughnessy: Determination is auspicious; regret is gone. The gentleman's radiance has
a return; auspicious.

Cleary (1): Remaining correct brings good results, without regret; the light of a superior
person has truth and goodness.

Cleary (2): Correctness brings good results; regret vanishes. The illumination of
developed people leads to good results.

Wu: To be persevering is auspicious. There will be no regrets. This shows the brilliance of
the jun zi. With confidence, there will be good fortune.

COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: The diffusion of that brightness tends to good fortune. Wilhelm/
Baynes: His light brings good fortune. Blofeld: The Superior Man has the glorious
custom of distributing his good fortune among the needy. [From the point of view of
divination, this implies that we should be very generous in sharing the promised good
fortune.] Ritsema/Karcher: One's brilliance significant indeed. Cleary (2): The
radiance of the illumination of developed people leads to good results. Wu: His radiance
brings good fortune.

Legge: Line five is magnetic in a dynamic place, but she is the humble ruler who is
supported by the dynamic second line, and hence the auspice is very good.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: Steadfastness to correct action and to sincerity on the part of the man has rallied
men of good faith. Victory is achieved. A glorious new era has replaced the decadent old
one.

Wing: Honest determination and correct principles have banished difficulties and
created the stimulating environment of an advanced society. A superior personality can
now rally others around him and lead them into a bright new era. Great things can be
attained.

Editor: The fifth line is in the middle of the trigram of Clarity, of light and intelligence.
She has the insight and comprehension which enable her to persevere -- clarity is the
foundation of will. The idea is that perseverance and comprehension reinforce each other.
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64

It is necessary that we should seek and knock, and thereby ask the Omnipotent
Power within ourselves, and remind it of its promises and keep it awake, and if
we do this in the proper form and with a pure and sincere heart, we shall receive
that for which we ask, and find that which we seek, and the doors of the Eternal
that have been closed before us will be opened, and what was hidden before our
sight will come to light.
Paracelsus

A. Look for the light, then follow it.

B. Clear perception enables you to differentiate the situation.
Line-6

Legge: The sixth line, dynamic, shows its subject full of confidence and therefore feasting
quietly. There will be no error. If he exceeds this confidence, till he is like the fox who gets
his head immersed, he will fail of what is right.

Wilhelm/Baynes: There is drinking of wine in genuine confidence. No blame. But if
one wets his head, he loses it, in truth.

Blofeld: Those in whom the people repose their trust may feast themselves without
doing wrong; but if they allow their heads to get wet they will forfeit that trust. [This is a
warning against excess. We have every right to enjoy our good fortune within
reasonable bounds; but, if we are guilty of an excess comparable to that of drunken men
who pour wine over one another's heads, we shall forfeit the high esteem in which we
are (or soon will be) held.]

Liu: He drinks wine with confidence. No blame. When his head gets wet, he loses
confidence.

Ritsema/Karcher: Possessing conformity: tending-towards drinking liquor. Without
fault. Soaking one's head. Possessing conformity: letting-go that.

Shaughnessy: There is a return in drinking wine; there is no trouble. Wetting his
head; there is a return, losing this.

Cleary (1): Having faith, one drinks wine without blame. When one gets one’s head wet,
having faith ceases to be right.

Cleary (2): There is sincerity in drinking wine, without fault. But if one becomes totally
immersed, having faith ceases to be right.

Wu: Having confidence in one’s capacity in drinking wine is not a cause for error.
However, if he immerses his head in it, the confidence is misplaced.
64 -- Unfinished Business - 64
COMMENTARY

Confucius/Legge: He does not know how to submit to the proper regulations.
Wilhelm/Baynes: When one wets his head while drinking wine, it is because he knows
no moderation. Blofeld: Because that would indicate a lack of restraint. Ritsema/
Karcher: Truly not knowing articulating indeed. Cleary (2): Not knowing proper
measure. Wu: He does not know his limit.

Legge: When the work of the hexagram is complete, line six appears properly disposed to
remain quiet and enjoy the confidence of his own power. If, on the contrary, he goes on to
exert these powers and meddle with the peril of the situation, the issue will be bad. The
symbolism of line six indicates a want of caution, and an unwillingness to submit one's
impulses to the regulation of reason and prudence.

NOTES AND PARAPHRASES

Siu: The man is filled with confidence and quietly feasting with convivial friends. No
error will result from such exuberance during the dawning of a new era. It must be kept
within proper bounds, however. Otherwise, intemperance will lead to forfeiting the
favorable gains achieved.

Wing: After the struggles are over there is a prevailing sense of well being which comes
from the promise of a refreshing new time. Enjoy this time of celebration but do not
indulge in excess, or your vision and, therefore, your confidence may be lost.

Editor: To "feast quietly" is to nourish oneself in a seemly manner. The idea is to calmly
consolidate your gains-- rest easy and don't be greedy for more than you already possess.
Ritsema/Karcher's advice from the Judgment: "In order to take advantage of the
situation, do not impose a direction on events," is especially appropriate here.

It is an honor for a man to cease from strife;
But every fool will be meddling.
Proverbs 20: 3

A. A modest success is indicated. Keep your head and don't get carried away:
"Leave well-enough alone."
