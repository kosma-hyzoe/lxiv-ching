# __lxiv-ching__
## _the minified, terminal-friendldy I Ching algorithm_
---

### Usage:
1. make sure (Python 3)[https://www.python.org/] is installed
2. change directory into the package path: `cd /path/to/lxivChing`
3. run `python3 lxiv-ching {query}`
   * where _{query}_ - optional question/query input
### Divination method explained:
* This minimalist version of the I Ching algorithm implies higher probability of recievieng changing lines.
This could be conisdered a con, but not neccessarily when utilizing specific line interpretation methods.
* _The recommended method_:
    * 1-3 changing lines: read commentaries for all the changing lines
      * 4-6 changing lines: read the upper most unchanging(_sic!_) line
      (in case of the first and the second hexagram a special, seventh commentary applies)
